The world was turned upside down when Michael Jordan decided to retire from the sport of basketball in 1993. He was the face of the NBA; a symbol of the game. MJ had just closed out the Phoenix Suns to complete his first three-peat, it was unfathomable that he would call it quits at that point -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/michael-jordans-5-biggest-nba-rivals.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he'd bested all of his biggest rivals</a> and was still at his peak. But that’s what happened. And it was awful.

After this unexpected announcement, we were forced to endure Jordan’s terrible foray into minor league baseball. It was hard to watch. Really hard. And then on March 18, 1995, his Airness made everything right with two simple words: “I’m Back." This statement was exactly what we needed, and his comeback proved to be well-worth the wait. However, it did take Jordan a bit to get his stride back. But when he did, it was as if he'd never left.

That game took place on March 28 at the mecca that is Madison Square Garden, in what was referred to as the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/history/features/moment-1995-jordan-back/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Double-nickel game</a>." MJ, wearing his Air Jordan X’s, lit up the Knicks for 55 points, and put the rest of the league on notice: Jordan was officially back. To honor the occasion, the <a href="http://sneakernews.com/2015/02/18/jordan-brand-celebrates-double-nickel-air-jordan-10-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordan Brand decided to release the Air Jordan X Remastered “Double Nickel"</a> on the celebrated date. Just past the 21st anniversary of that historic game, we were caught thinking about the Double Nickels, and our favorite Jordans, so let’s celebrate the seven best Air Jordan shoes of all time.

<h2> 7.  Air Jordan VI</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761786" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761786 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-VI-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

The <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Jordan VI</a> has to make the list because they were the kicks Jordan sported when he took home his first <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1991_finals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA Championship in 1991</a>. This sneaker is a very cool high-top with a dark black tone, bright red areas, and mini air bubbles. But the defining feature, they say, is the <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-sided rubber tongue</a> which made it easier to slip these bad boys on. MJ was certainly ahead of the curve.

<h2> 6. Air Jordan II</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761781" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761781 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-II-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

The reason people wanted to “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/be-like-mike-the-top-7-athlete-commercials-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be Like Mike</a>" was because they’d never witnessed anyone soar through the air quite like he did. These shoes were released right after MJ’s second season in the NBA, and he was wearing them when he won his first <a href="http://www.nba-allstar.com/contests/slamdunk/winners.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slam Dunk crown</a>. They also stand out because they were the <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Nike sneaker that didn’t feature the swoosh logo</a>.

<h2>5. Air Jordan I</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761782" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761782" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-I-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

There’s nothing quite like the original, and these sneakers were absolute game changers. Jordan wore these shoes in his first-ever NBA game and broke the rules each time he put them on after that. The NBA had a uniform policy that forbid players from wearing shoes that weren’t white. The <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Jordan I</a>'s clearly violate that regulation. Jordan was <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined $5,000 each time he wore these in an NBA game</a>. Why should his Airness fit in, when he was born to stand out? Fine by us.

<h2>4. Air Jordan XII</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761783" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761783" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-XII-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

The Air Jordan XII was a basketball player’s dream shoe. Not only was the two tone color extremely appealing to the eye, but sneaker itself was constructed to be <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-xii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light-weight and provide quick lateral responsiveness</a>. But if the gold-plated lace loops don’t do it for you, then just remember that MJ used these sneakers during his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-gutsiest-sports-performances-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legendary flu game</a>. Yeah, now we know you want them.

<h2>3. Air Jordan XIII</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761787" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761787" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-XIII-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

When Michael Jordan retired from the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Bulls</a> for the second time, at least he went out on top. He also wore these sneakers during that final season. The <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-xiii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Jordan XIII</a> was designed to imitate MJ’s <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-xiii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predatory nature</a> on the basketball court. They also provide incredible cushioning, and feature a super cool hologram. But we’ll always love them because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdPQ3QxDZ1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this moment</a>.

<h2> 2. Air Jordan III</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761785" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761785 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-III-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

The <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Jordan III</a>'s are Michael Jordan’s favorite sneaker out of the whole bunch. Some things that make these shoes so special are that they were the <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first one designed by Tinker Hatfield</a>, and they introduced the world to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCavIpRIZz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mars Blackmon</a>." Also these were the first Air Jordans to feature the iconic Jumpman logo. We’re all about the historical factor.

<h2> 1. Air Jordan XI</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761784" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761784 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/air-jordan-XI-shoe-640x414.jpg" alt="Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ" width="757" height="490" /> Source: Air Jordan Shoes HQ[/caption]

The <a href="http://airjordanshoeshq.com/air-jordan-xi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Jordan XI</a> is the classiest sneaker in the whole collection. These shoes were worn by Jordan during his first full-season after returning from his unexpected retirement. They are also the first sneaker in history to showcase patent leather. The Air Jordan XI is stylish, shiny, and extremely memorable. We absolutely love this shoe. The Air Jordan never looked so good.

		<description><![CDATA[Just because most people in the NBA respect each other, doesn't mean they all get along. Who has the most sour relationships in professional basketball?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_701861" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-701861" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Kevin-Garnett-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin Garnett looks sweaty." width="757" height="473" /> Many fans won't miss Kevin Garnett. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Remember back when the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> doled out penalties for<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/an-nba-comparison-kevin-love-vs-kevin-garnett.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Kevin Garnett</a> and Dwight Howard over their altercation in a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Houston Rockets. Garnett, now on the Timberwolves, received the stiffer fine, a one-game suspension without pay for head-butting the Rockets’ center, while Howard received a $15,000 fine for his own part in the matter.

Sometimes these things happen. In the heat of the moment, players can lose their cool, and use poor judgment. However, other times, players simply just don’t like each other. And this is the case with Garnett and Howard. People in NBA circles are familiar with the fact that these two players don’t get along. And, unfortunately, this sort of thing happens in professional sports.

Sometimes there are rivalries between teams, and sometimes there are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/michael-jordans-5-biggest-nba-rivals.html/">rivalries between individual players</a>. And this should come as no surprise, given how physical it can get out on the basketball court. However, feuds in the NBA aren’t always limited between players, and some of these ill feelings are quite legendary. Here are our top 10 feuds in NBA history.

<h2>10. Allen Iverson vs. Practice</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745783" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745783 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/allen-iverson.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Former Philadelphia 76er fan favorite Allen Iverson is among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-hall-of-fame-moments-in-allen-iversons-career.html/">toughest pound-for-pound players</a> in NBA history. He may have been listed at six-feet tall, but that number is generous at best. And yet, for his tiny stature, Iverson never hesitated to put his body in harm’s way. As a dynamic scorer and fierce competitor, Allen Iverson always came to play on game night. However, practice was an entirely different story.

No words could possibly do justice to how much Iverson disliked participating in practice. He fought it to the bitter end. So, let’s just let AI do the talking:

<h2>9. LeBron James vs. DeShawn Stevenson</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSrgPX6Eo6Q"></iframe>

Throughout his NBA career, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-lebrons-5-biggest-rivals-in-the-nba.html/">King has had his fair share of rivals</a>. So we're clear, DeShawn Stevenson is not one of them. Not even close. Still, that didn't stop Stevenson, then with the Washington Wizards, from <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas/mavericks/post/_/id/4678739/deshawn-stevenson-lebron-beef-pretty-much-over">calling James "overrated"</a> back in 2008. Eventually, this ridiculous feud between the two players -- who were clearly not on the same level -- reached epic proportions when Soulja Boy (Team Stevenson) and Jay-Z (Team LeBron) ended up getting included in the "dispute." Only in the NBA.

<h2>8. Jason Kidd vs. Jimmy Jackson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_520311" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-520311 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kidd-Filippo-Montefore-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Filippo Montefore/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="562" /> Jason Kidd wanted out of Dallas | FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

If you like rumors, then this beef is the one for you. <a href="http://www.espn.com/page2/s/list/teammatefeuds/031103.html">According to the story</a>, back in 1996, singer Toni Braxton stopped by the Mavs hotel to pick Jason Kidd up for a date. Instead, however, she ended up leaving with Jimmy Jackson. To make matters worse, when pressed about the situation, Braxton had this to say: "I've at least heard of them [but] as far as dating, whether it's true or not, I can never kiss and tell." To this day, both players deny the event ever happened. Either way, a young and talented Dallas Mavericks team broke up before its time. What a shame

<h2>7. Alonzo Mourning vs. Larry Johnson</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KRONorKxXI4"></iframe>

With Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning leading the way, the Charlotte Hornets of the early 1990s had a chance to be something special. Unfortunately, egos got in the way; starting in 1992, when Johnson held up his Rookie of the Year jacket and <a href="https://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/teammatefeuds/031103.html">provoked Mourning</a>, saying, "Hey, young fellow, if you play real hard you might get one of these jackets." Thus began the eventual demise of one of our favorite NBA Jam teams ever.

<h2>6. Paul Pierce vs. Quentin Richardson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598520" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598520" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Paul-Pierce-640x451.jpg" alt="Harry How/Getty Images" width="757" height="533" /> Paul Pierce with a perfect reaction | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Although it was Kevin Garnett and Quentin Richardson who got into it during a 2010 playoff game between the Celtics and the Heat, in reality, the issue was and will always be between Richardson and Paul Pierce. Per an article by Marc J. Spears of Yahoo Sports, the conflict dates all the way back to Pierce's time at Kansas. <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Why-do-Quentin-Richardson-and-Paul-Pierce-not-li?urn=nba,235123">Wrote Spears</a>:
<blockquote>"Pierce once hosted Richardson as a recruit at the University of Kansas. Neither player has fully explained what the problem is, but this much is clear: Richardson has always seemed to be more irritated about the situation — and, as a result, has done most of the talking."</blockquote>

<h2>5. Michael Jordan vs. Isiah Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674007" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674007 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Michael-Jordan-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr/Getty Images" width="757" height="497" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/michael-jordan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> may be the best basketball player to ever play the game, but he also played with an enormous chip on his shoulder.

Jordan would use every setback, every insult, every instance of disrespect, as motivation to go out and destroy his opponents. He never forgot that he didn’t make his high school varsity basketball team, or that two players were picked ahead of him in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1984.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1984 NBA Draft</a>. And he certainly never forgot his first All-Star game as a rookie. It was on this stage, that Isiah Thomas allegedly called for a “<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/sports/8501080975_1_dunk-show-players-attitudes-star-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeze-out</a>" of Jordan. It was here that MJ started his distaste for the Detroit Pistons point guard.

<h2>4. Reggie Miller vs. Spike Lee</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745798" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="wp-image-745798 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Reggie-Miller-and-Spike-Lee.jpg" alt="Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images" width="758" height="505" /> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

Madison Square garden is one of the most historic arenas in the NBA. For players, regardless of how good or bad the Knicks are, there is something transcendent about playing in front of the New York faithful at MSG. And former Indiana Pacers sharpshooter Reggie Miller lived for these moments.

He could catch fire at any time, and he always picked up his game when he played the Knicks. When this occurred, you knew that he and longtime Knicks fan Spike Lee were going go at it. Their jabbering made for great television. And it made for one of the better documentaries in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-best-espns-30-for-30-documentaries-ever.html/">ESPN's "30 for 30" series</a>.

<h2>3. Karl Malone vs. Dennis Rodman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672779" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672779" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jordan-Pippen-Rodman-Vince-LaForget-AFP-Getty-Images-580x500.jpg" alt="Vince LaForget/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="653" /> VINCE LAFORGET/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Back in the day, when the NBA was a considerably more “chippy" place, and players tended to be more “hands on" with each other, Karl Malone and Dennis Rodman would battle in the post. And it was brutal. Malone was fantastic with his back to the basket, and his turn-around was legendary. Rodman was an immensely talented defender who had a knack for getting in opposing players’ heads with his unrelenting pressure and constant trash-talking.

So, it was no surprise that they got tangled up in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sXhKrn2uWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1998 NBA</a> Finals when Rodman’s Chicago Bulls faced off against Malone and the Utah Jazz. However, if this seemed like a mess, it was nothing compared to when these two met in the ring at the <a href="http://www.wwe.com/videos/karl-malone-diamond-dallas-page-vs-dennis-rodman-hulk-hogan-bash-at-the-beach-19-26009541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1998 Bash at the Beach</a>.

<h2>2. Michael Jordan vs. Jerry Krause</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713185" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-713185" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jordan-Brian-Bahr-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="539" /> BRIAN BAHR/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

When Michael Jordan won his six NBA championships with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Bulls</a>, he and General Manager Jerry Krause had differing opinions as to who deserved the lion’s share of the credit. Krause believed that the organization was heavily responsible for the team’s success, while Jordan believed that the organization never stepped on the court — the players did. Talk about drama.

One would think that Jordan would be able to put this all in the past. However, MJ made sure to immortalize his opinions when he spoke during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLzBMGXfK4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hall of Fame induction back in 2009.</a>

<h2>1. Shaq vs. Kobe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705382" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705382 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/56487254-640x471.jpg" alt="Eliot J. Schechter/Getty Images" width="757" height="557" /> Eliot J. Schechter/Getty Images[/caption]

The Los Angeles Lakers were a basketball dynasty in the early 1990s, when they managed to three-peat from 2000-2002. With Shaquille O’Neal and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant</a> leading the way, the Lakers had something brewing in Tinseltown. They were exciting, prolific, and dominant. And yet, they could have been so much more. What prevented this from happening?  <a href="http://www.lakersnation.com/a-complete-timeline-of-the-shaquille-oneal-kobe-bryant-feud/2013/04/02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaq and Kobe hated each other</a>. And this was no secret.

Shaq believed that the offense should continue to run through him, and Kobe thought the center was lazy. Sure, these two managed to put aside their differences long enough to win multiple titles, but there was only room for one alpha dog in Hollywood. And in the end, the Lakers chose Kobe, who ended up winning two more crowns without the Diesel.

These two superstars have since squashed their beef. If only they had done it years ago, that Lakers team could have been truly special.]]></content:encoded>

We’ve already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-most-unbreakable-records-in-major-league-baseball-history.html/">said this a time or two</a>, but records are made to be broken. While some records are relatively within reach (say, minutes per game), others look like they'll remain unchanged for another few decades of NBA play.

It's unlikely that anyone will get as many technical fouls as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-completely-changed-game.html/">Rasheed Wallace</a>, whose general attitude and incessant repetitions -- think "ball don't lie" or "both teams played hard, my man. Both teams played hard." -- made him a singular force, or at least a singular target, for NBA officials. We're not going to talk about those sorts of (in)famous records in this piece, even though we still miss 'Sheed's performances on the hardwood. No, this piece is for some of the most impressive achievements in hoops history, the sort of milestones passed only and exclusively by legends.

With that said, here are the 10 most unbreakable records in NBA history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Highest single-season scoring average</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804873" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-804873" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Wilt-Chamberlain.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="680" height="1021" /> Wilt Chamberlain retired with multiple unbreakable NBA records on his resume | Wen Roberts/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 50.36
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Wilt Chamberlain

Wilt "The Stilt" holds the top four single-season scoring averages in NBA history, and no player has even come close to his record setting <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHW/1962.html">1961<span class="s1">–</span>62 season</a>. Over the last 25 years, the next closest per game scoring average was Kobe Bryant’s 35.4 points per game in 2005<span class="s1">–</span>06.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Most points in a single game</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxMeEzhvNRs"></iframe>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 100
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Wilt Chamberlain

Chamberlain had six career games with 70 or more points, and no other player in league history has had more than one. None were more impressive than his 100-point effort on March 2, 1962, though. The next closest single-game scoring total has been Kobe Bryant’s 81-point performance on January 22, 2006.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Most career rebounds</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xr3i9jpiTE"></iframe>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 23,924
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Wilt Chamberlain

Not only will this record never be broken, we can't envision a scenario where another player even comes close. When Tim Duncan retired this offseason after 19 seasons in the league, he was 8,833 rebounds behind Chamberlain. The current leader among active players is Dwight Howard with 11,133 boards.

<h2>4. Most career assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804875" align="aligncenter" width="675"]<img class="wp-image-804875 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John-Stockton.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="675" height="1024" /> John Stockton handed out assists better than anyone in NBA history | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 15,806
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: John Stockton

If you saw Stockton walking down the street, our guess is that you would never believe that he holds two unbreakable NBA records and is one of the greatest point guards in NBA history. The active career leader is Andre Miller, whose 8,524 assists are just over half of Stockton’s total, and the next closest player, 31-year-old Chris Paul, has only 7,688 career assists.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Most career steals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709733" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709733" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/John-Stockton_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-2-1024x685.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="757" height="506" /> John Stockton owns multiple unbreakable NBA records | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 3,265
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: John Stockton

Like his career assists record, Stockton’s record of 3,265 career steals is also untouchable. The next closest active player is Chris Paul, whose career is on the back nine, with 1,793 career steals.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Most consecutive NBA titles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804884" align="aligncenter" width="765"]<img class="wp-image-804884" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Boston-Celtics-Championship-Banners.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="765" height="470" /> The Boston Celtics have won 17 NBA titles | Brian Babineau/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 8
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Boston Celtics

To put a little perspective on this record, no other NBA franchise has won more than three consecutive titles. This record will stand the test of time.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2> 7. Most career NBA titles (single player)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804886" align="aligncenter" width="675"]<img class="wp-image-804886 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bill-Russell.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="675" height="1024" /> Bill Russell has more rings than he has fingers | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 11
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Bill Russell

It’s hard to imagine a player <a title="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players Ever" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/more-rings-are-better-the-13-most-successful-nba-players-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching double-digit NBA titles</a> ever again. The players with the best chance are 31-year-old LeBron James, who currently has  three rings on his resume, and 28-year-old Stephen Curry, who has just one ring. For either player to have a chance, they would have to reel off seven or eight championships in a row before their 40th birthday -- not going to happen.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Most career NBA titles (coach)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804870" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804870 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan_Phil-Jackson.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="757" height="609" /> Phil Jackson has a pretty strong case as the best coach in NBA history | Jeff Haynes/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 11
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Phil Jackson

Jackson's 11 career titles as an NBA head coach are six more than the active career leader, 67-year-old San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich. Don't expect to see this record be broken anytime soon.

<h2>9. Most wins in a single season</h2>
[caption id="attachment_651315" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-651315" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Stephen-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="800" height="534" /> Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to a league record 73 wins in 2015-16 | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 73
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Golden State Warriors

The 2015<span class="s1">–</span>16 Warriors set a new record for most wins in a single-season, but came up short against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. While the Warriors broke a record that we had previously said was unbreakable, we just don't see them (or anybody else) ever winning 74 games in one year.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Longest winning streak</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804867" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804867 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LA-Lakers-Title-Banners.jpg" alt="10 NBA Records That No One Seems to Be Able to Break" width="757" height="505" /> The Los Angeles Lakers display their championships | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 33 games
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Los Angeles Lakers

The Golden State Warriors came within five games of the 1971–72 Los Angles Lakers’ record 33-game winning streak, but this is another record we simply do not see going down anytime soon. The current NBA is simply too competitive for a team to go on what would amount to a two-month winning streak.

		<description><![CDATA[The Lakers thought Steve Nash had three good years left when they acquired him in 2012. He didn't. Here are 10 NBA players whose careers ended too soon.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_521659" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-521659 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nash-Kevork-Djansezisan-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Los Angeles Lakers consider their NBA careers." width="757" height="528" /> This Lakers team did not work out as planned. | Kevork Djansezisan/Getty Images[/caption]

Many great <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> players have been able to choose when to leave the game they love. While not all of them get a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-kobe-bryants-farewell-game-reminded-us-of-his-greatness.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant-style retirement tour</a>, the overwhelming majority of veteran NBA players get to walk away on their own terms, knowing that as their age increases and skill decreases, it’s best to let the younger guys take over.

Once a player has made his millions, he can move on to the next phase of his life, whether that involves working in sports media, operating a business, or living off the income he made in his prime. However, some athletes are not so lucky. These basketball players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-who-could-retire-after-this-season.html/">wanted to keep playing</a> <span class="s1">-- doing </span>everything they could to stay on the court <span class="s1">-- </span>but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-promising-nba-careers-derailed-by-injuries.html/">some form of injury</a> brought their NBA careers to premature ends.

In a few cases, this was before the player ever proved exactly what they could do at the professional level. In others, these NBA talents put up good numbers over a solid career (perhaps even a spectacular one), but they left us wanting more at the end. These pros from the past 20 years saw their NBA careers end too soon. Who would you add?

<h2>1. Steve Nash</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715940" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715940" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/185696357-640x426.jpg" alt="Steve Nash rests during an intense game." width="757" height="504" /> For many NBA fans, Steve Nash is the first injury-plagued player who comes to mind | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

The inspiration for this list is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-completely-changed-game.html/">two-time MVP Steve Nash</a>, who announced <a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/steve-nash-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his retirement</a> in March 2015. The 40-year-old had a long career, but his time in Los Angeles was a complete disappointment. Nash could not stay healthy; he was limited to just 65 appearances over two seasons (164 possible games).

Los Angeles paid a king’s ransom <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-stars-who-briefly-wore-another-uniform.html/">to acquire him</a> from divisional foe Phoenix in 2012, shipping four draft picks (including two first-rounders) to the Suns and signing the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/">point guard</a> to a three-year, $28 million deal. Obviously, the Lakers brain trust still thought Nash had a few high-level seasons left in the tank. Clearly, they were mistaken.

<h2>2. Brandon Roy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715937" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715937" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/113118733.jpg" alt="Brandon Roy raises his fist as he walks off the court." width="757" height="548" /> Brandon Roy could have been the next Kobe | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

Blazers standout Brandon Roy <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-forced-retire-early.html/">could not stay healthy</a> long enough to fulfill all of the enormous potential that the 2006 first-round pick displayed during his time on the court. Roy averaged 19 points per game during five seasons with the Blazers (winning a Rookie of the Year award and making the All-Star Game in 2008, 2009, and 2010 ). However, he had to call it quits due to bad knees.

Roy <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/blazers/index.ssf/2011/12/brandon_roy_retires_after_doct.html">underwent a half-dozen surgeries</a> and lost most of the cartilage in his knees before finally hanging it up. He made a brief comeback with the Timberwolves in 2012<span class="s1">–</span>13, but was only able to play in five games before needing yet another surgery.

<h2>3. Yao Ming</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715934" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715934" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/106148233-640x426.jpg" alt="Yao Ming stands on the basketball court between plays." width="757" height="504" /> Yao Ming is a basketball icon, but his NBA play was often hampered | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

Chinese center Yao Ming made every inch of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/size-20-shoes-nba-players-biggest-feet.html/">his 7-foot-6 presence</a> felt during an impressive career with the Houston Rockets. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft scored 19 points a game, pulled down nine rebounds a night, and singlehandedly <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/5-on-5-110719/yao-ming-retirement-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helped make</a> the NBA a big deal in the world’s most populous country.

Yao was an eight-time All-Star and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-4-greatest-moments-of-yao-mings-career.html/">dominated his position</a> during the 2000s. Sadly, he was forced to retire at 30 due to injury. The Rockets star played just five games combined in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons before finally ending his playing career.

<h2>4. Jay Williams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715932" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715932" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1850368-640x419.jpg" alt="Jay Williams struggles to get past a defender." width="757" height="496" /> Jay Williams was never the same after his motorcycle accident | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

The man drafted right behind Ming in 2002, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-who-stayed-in-school-too-long.html/">Duke standout Jay Williams</a> also failed to enjoy a full NBA career. The incredibly talented athlete played just one year for the Chicago Bulls before suffering severe injuries in a June 2003 motorcycle accident. Williams’ violation of his Bulls contract came at a steep price.

According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sports/basketball/a-leg-rebuilt-a-life-renewed-for-jay-williams.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times profile</a>, the bike crash left Williams with a total knee dislocation, torn ligaments, a dislocated pelvis, a torn nerve, a severed artery, and more. Remarkably, Williams made it back to an NBA training camp and the D-League three years later. However, fans still wonder what the likely NBA superstar could have done if his career lasted more than the 2002–03 season.

<h2>5. Bobby Hurley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715927" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715927" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/51585104-640x456.jpg" alt="Bobby Hurley reaches for the ball against the Seattle Supersonics." width="757" height="540" /> Bobby Hurley reaches for the ball against the Seattle Supersonics | Dan Levine/Getty Images[/caption]

Williams wasn’t the only Duke guard to have his NBA career shortened by a tragic accident. Bobby Hurley, the 1993 first-round pick by the Sacramento Kings, was critically injured <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/325673/KINGS-BOBBY-HURLEY-CRITICALLY-INJURED.html?pg=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a car crash</a> less than six weeks after making his league debut. Despite the wreck leaving him <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940102&amp;slug=1887804">with collapsed lungs</a>, fractured bones, a torn tendon, and broken ribs, Hurley worked hard and miraculously returned to the floor by the start of the 1994–95 season.

Sadly, though, he was never the same player after that. Hurley averaged just 3.8 points per game in his career, first with the Kings and then later the Grizzlies. “I knew I was a lot better than I showed… It did hand me some physical limitations that I didn’t have prior to that happening,” Hurley <a href="http://www.insidesocal.com/lakers/2014/06/24/nba-draft-qa-former-seventh-overall-pick-bobby-hurley-copes-with-car-accident-shortening-his-career/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told InsideSoCal.com</a> recently. He was only 26 years old when he played his final professional basketball game.

<h2>6. Gilbert Arenas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657890" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657890" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Gilbert-Arenas-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images-640x420.jpg" alt="Gilbert Arenas looks at the ref and argues a call." width="757" height="497" /> Oh, Gilbert | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2001 draft, Gilbert Arenas quickly established himself as one of the top shooters in the game. At his peak, specifically the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/arenagi01.html">2005–06 season</a>, the man they called "Agent Zero" put up 29.3 points per game, dished out 6.1 assists a night, shot 44.7% from the field, and knocked down almost 37% of his three-point shots.

Unfortunately, Arenas' career was cut short because he simply could not get out of his own way. Whether it involved <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-enemies-players-dont-like-each-other.html/">feuding with teammates</a> or facing his fair share of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=4802267">legal trouble</a>, The Hibachi's poor judgment ultimately led to him leaving the league after a 17-game stint in the 2011–12 season. Arenas was just 30 years old at the time.

<h2>7. Anfernee Hardaway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_534564" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-534564 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Penny-Hardaway-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Anfernee Hardaway stands on the court between plays." width="757" height="496" /> Anfernee Hardaway could've been so much more | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Anfernee Hardaway was the sort of point guard who doesn't come around everyday. Not only was he 6-foot-7, but he had a mean handle to go along with an unbelievably quick first step, too. Penny could finish at the bucket, knock down the mid-range jumper, and was able to use his high basketball IQ to make everyone around him better.

Simply put, he was a superstar. Then he suffered a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/penny-hardaway-wonders-why-nobody-seemed-why-hurting-173548906.html">devastating knee injury</a>, and everything changed. From that moment on, Penny was never the same player. Think Derrick Rose before Derrick Rose. Yeah, we know what you're thinking -- that sucks.

<h2>8. Tracy McGrady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_572751" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572751" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tracy-McGrady-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x412.jpg" alt="Tracy McGrady puts his hands on his knees as he catches his breath." width="757" height="487" /> Tracy McGrady had it all | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Tracy McGrady <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-must-retire-jersey.html/">was special</a>. There really is no other way to put it. One of the most gifted scorers the game has ever seen, T-Mac, a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mcgratr01.html">seven-time All-Star</a> and a seven-time All-NBA selection, could singlehandedly decimate the opposition in any number of ways. Daggers from well beyond the arc, thunderous finishes at the rim, shooting streaks like an NBA Jam player on fire...

At his best, McGrady was pretty much unstoppable. Had it not been for the fact that his back and knee essentially abandoned him on the regular, who knows how good McGrady could have been. Instead, he was out of the league at 32. We're not crying... You're crying. Shut up.

<h2>9. Bill Walton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758698" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758698" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bill-Walton-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Bill Walton holds up his hands and greets Celtics fans." width="757" height="543" /> Bill Walton couldn't escape the injury bug | Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

Bill Walton was never better than he was during his first four years with the Portland Trail Blazers. During that stint (1974–75 to 1977–78), Big Red averaged 17.1 points and 13.5 rebounds per game, made two All-Star Game appearances, and twice earned All-NBA and All-Defensive honors. He also won an NBA title and received Finals MVP.

Yet, foot injuries marred his career and cost him three full seasons. Walton may have lasted in the league until he was 34 years old, but he was far from the player he once was.

<h2>10. Magic Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758690" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758690" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Magic-Johnson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Magic Johnson looks serious as he stands on the court." width="757" height="502" /> We could all use a little more Magic | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

There's nothing you can say about Magic Johnson that people haven't heard before. He was "Showtime" personified; a genius with the ball, and a visionary who is easily among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-top-nba-players-ever-rank.html/">greatest players of all time</a>. Unfortunately, in 1991, the then-31-year-old was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/professional-athletes-walked-in-prime.html/">forced to retire</a> from the game after being diagnosed with HIV.

Johnson attempted to make a brief comeback during the 1995–96 season. However, he'd been out of the league for four years, so he didn't have the same Magic. If only we could get those four years back.

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James is, without a doubt, one of the greatest players to ever suit up in the NBA. But where does he rank among the top 10 true titans of the game?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="yoast-text-mark" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Bill-Russell-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

After avoiding the disgrace of a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2-5 record in the 2016 NBA Finals</a>, LeBron James finally delivered on his longstanding promise to his hometown franchise; he brought a championship back to Cleveland.

It was, unreservedly, a great sports moment. Even if you spent most of the playoffs rooting against the Cavaliers for whatever reason (maybe <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-moments-when-we-hated-lebron-james.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you don't like James</a>, maybe you think Dan Gilbert is a sleazeball, maybe you didn't like <a href="https://twitter.com/ArashMarkazi/status/744864676257771520/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Dellavedova's fashion decisions</a>), you had to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tip your hat to James</a> and company for doing what no other sports team based out of the Cleve had done for over half a century.

For a little while, Cleveland savored a reprieve from their status as the sporting world's punching bag, and they owe it to one of the greatest basketball players of all time. But how great is James, exactly? You could fill a library with takes on the topic, particularly since he's been the NBA's biggest superstar in the internet age.

Everyone has an opinion on LeBron, for better or worse. But it's safe to say that he has secured his spot as one of the 10 greatest players of all time. Of course, there's something to be said for celebrating the best players in league history on their own merits; Dr. J was Capital-G Great, Oscar Robertson was Capital-G Great, as were Elgin Baylor, and Bob Cousey, and Charles Barkley, and Hakeem Olajuwon, and so on).

While you can't fault any fan for placing those guys in their personal pantheon, not making the cut here doesn't diminish their careers in the slightest. That's not this kind of list. (For the record Sir Charles, Dr. J, and the Big O are all somewhere in my personal top 10 of favorite NBA players.)

This list will try to be as empirical as possible -- at least as much as you can be when ranking across eras -- by comparing accolades, dominance, rings, and, yes, stats. You can't hold the rules of the game in today's day and age against LeBron any more than you can hold the fact that there was no salary cap before the 1984<span class="s1">–</span>85 season against the guys who played then. Here are the top 10 NBA players of all time.
<p class="wp-more-tag mce-wp-nextpage" title="Page break"><!--nextpage--></p>

<h2 class="wp-more-tag mce-wp-nextpage" title="Page break">10. Shaquille O'Neal</h2>
<img class="wp-image-657571" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Shaq-Vince-Bucci-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Four-time <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-all-time-greatest-scorers-in-nba-postseason-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA Champion</a>, three-time Finals MVP, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more All-Star and All-NBA accolades</a> than you can easily list on your fingers and toes, Shaq may be best known among the current generation of young basketball fans as one of the analysts on <em>Inside the NBA</em>, but anyone who watched him in his prime will forever link him to one word: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-history-shaq-dunks-on-kelvin-cato.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dominant</a>.

The NBA is not a league for small people, generally speaking. But O'Neal dwarfed everyone on the court. With a personality to match, we can make the argument that Shaq became one of the greatest celebrities to come out of the hardwood, as his critically questionable but highly visible forays into film and music can attest.

This list isn't about that, though. This is about his place as one of the all-time greats, and as the primary force behind the Lakers' three-peat to kick off the 2000s, his singlehanded ability to shape the game on both ends of the floor was nearly unparalleled. Why so low, then? The second half of his career couldn't measure up to the first (save for a 2006 championship in Miami).

O'Neal often struggled to stay on the floor (he only cracked 70 games once after 2005, despite not retiring until 2012) as he wandered around the league from team to team to close out his time in the NBA. It's not uncontroversial to say that if anyone on this list should have won more rings, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's Shaq</a>.

<h2>9. Larry Bird</h2>
<img class="wp-image-526918 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry-Bird-Tim-DeFrisco-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Full disclosure: Putting Larry Legend at No. 9 on this list is rough, not only because it slots him between a pair of Lakers but because it forces us to consider just how much of Bird's mystique is intangible.

Arguably the most accomplished passing forward of all time, definitely one of the best rebounding small forwards of all time, potentially the greatest shooter of all time by some reckoning, and definitely one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game's greatest trash talkers</a>, any argument for Bird's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-boston-celtics-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">merit as a player</a> inevitably transcends stats because, well, it's hard to make a case for him otherwise.

The idea that he played in a league that hadn't embraced the three-point shot is true, of course. However, there's something to be said for the legions of fans who would still take him over anyone else (in the history of the game) to make a shot with everything on the line. And that's before you get to the fact that he was the best player on one of the NBA's best teams ever, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1986.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1985-86 Boston Celtics</a>.

But with only three championships and a career riddled with injuries, time hasn't been kind to the Hick from French Lick. We'd still take him ahead of the No. 8 player on this list in an all-time redraft, though. Consider our cards shown and our biases laid bare.

<h2>8. Kobe Bryant</h2>
<img class="wp-image-625510" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant-J-Pat-Carter-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

It'll still be strange to see the 2016-17 NBA season kick off <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-kobe-bryants-farewell-game-reminded-us-of-his-greatness.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">without Kobe on the bench</a> for the Los Angeles Lakers, even though an Achilles' tendon rupture effectively ended his career back in 2013. At the end of the day, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/throwback-throwdowns-kobe-bryants-behind-the-back-reverse-jam.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bryant's career</a> is nothing short of a master class in persistence.

From <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-nba-players-who-are-scoring-maniacs.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his 81-point game</a> on a forgettable mid-2000s squad and his five rings to his top-three position on the all-time scoring list and the fact that he took the most missed shots in league history, Kobe kept going at 110% as long as he could, which was just shy of two decades.

You can use the description as derisively or as appraisingly as you want, but out of all the players who tried to be the second Michael Jordan in the modern-day NBA, Kobe was the only one to even come close.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. LeBron James</h2>
<img class="wp-image-657020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-3.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

LeBron over Kobe? Yes, you're reading correctly. You can make an argument for Bryant, but we believe that James swings the balance of a team in ways that Kobe never did.

If in-his-prime Kobe is the best player on your team and you don't have a Hall of Fame coach (or, if you don't want to be charitable to Pau Gasol, not paired with an elite big man), you're winning 34 games and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2005.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">missing the playoffs</a>. If it's LeBron? Yeah, you going to the postseason.

While James still trails Bryant in the rings department, he's managed to bring his teams to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-lebron-jamess-finals-appearances.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seven straight NBA Finals</a>, and took the Cleveland Cavaliers from a lottery team to the upper echelon of the league overnight. That counts for something -- to say nothing of his prodigious on-court talent and astonishing numbers, as well as his health, which has to be counted as an asset.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Tim Duncan</h2>
<img class="yoast-text-mark" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tim-Duncan-San-Antonio-Spurs.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

If you want to get all Vince Lombardi about this, though, Tim Duncan should (and would) be rated much higher on this list. The San Antonio Spurs have been the best franchise in basketball ever since drafting the Wake Forest forward first overall in the 1997 NBA Draft.

The Spurs famously put together more 50-win seasons <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-nba-players-with-the-most-playoff-experience.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with The Big Fundamental</a> than some teams have accumulated in their entire history. At this point it's clearly Duncan, not Kobe, who is the best player of his generation.

The fact that Duncan continued to be effective <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-oldest-active-players.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well after hitting 30</a>, or 35, for that matter, speaks to his quiet, understated greatness. There's a high likelihood here that Duncan will be leapfrogged by James by the time the King hangs it up, but as it stands now, we give the edge to Old Man Riverwalk.

<h2>5. Magic Johnson</h2>
<img class="wp-image-604707" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Bob-McAdoo-RHONA-WISE-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Similar to his eternal counterpart, Larry Bird, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-magic-johnson-delivers-for-michigan-state.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Johnson</a> saw his promising career imperiled by health problems -- although instead of a bad back, Johnson contracted HIV prior to the 1991-92 season, and spent the next four years in retirement, which leaves something to the imagination when considering how his career "could have gone".

Unlike Bird, though, the numbers have been kinder to Magic over the years, and his three MVP awards, three Finals MVP awards, five rings, single-season steals, and assist leadership (to say nothing of the fact that he leads the NBA in career assists-per-game numbers with an eye-popping 11.2) help keep the legacy of the key member of the Showtime Lakers alive.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
<img class="yoast-text-mark" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Not only the NBA's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/more-rings-are-better-the-13-most-successful-nba-players-ever.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time leading scorer</a>, this guy was able to win a Finals MVP award in 1970 and then win another one 15 years later. Add six rings, six MVP awards, nearly 20 years of All-Star appearances, and legendary durability...

Kareem never missed more than 20 games in a single season throughout his career -- this was well before the advent of modern sports medicine -- and you're just starting to scratch the surface of the former-Lew Alcindor's resume (which includes a storied NCAA career as well; even if we're not commenting on that directly we've got to give the guy who got the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-big-men-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dunk banned some props</a>).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
<img class="wp-image-657725" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Wilt-Matt-Campbell-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

There is a position held among some NBA fans that Wilt Chamberlain does not deserve to be lauded among the best of the very best because he "wasn't a winner." This is a bad take for many reasons, but mostly because it completely undersells just how dominant Chamberlain was.

Just like we can't hold Bird's shooting (the same goes for guys like Pete Maravich) to the standard of today with any facsimile of honesty, we have to hold Wilt against the standard of his day -- and The Stilt completely dominated everyone and everything on the floor. In his first six seasons with the Warriors (both in Philadelphia and San Francisco) Chamberlain <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>averaged </em></a><a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 41 points and 25 rebounds per game</a>. That's insane.

For his career -- one that was turned back again and again by one of the greatest defenders the game has ever seen -- Chamberlain averaged "just" 30 points and 22 boards; something that has been done exactly never since. Given that this was over a 13-year career, it's not as if he came in for a season or two and blew the doors off of everyone before vanishing into the night. We all just watched LeBron put up 41-11-8 and were awestruck, right?

Now imagine someone <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GNC6uzGPMAI/VTwgVIhdVvI/AAAAAAAAGJc/5rmjr-Rrfc8/s800-Ic42/NBA%252520EDSF%252520Warrios%252520vs%252520Nationals%252520G5%2525201962%252528better%252520version%252529.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting up 56-35 and 12 blocks</a>. A four time NBA MVP, a two-time NBA Champion, and second all time in Win Shares (to Kareem, who spent the second half of his career playing with Magic and Showtime), the only guy to ever score 100 points in a single game is, weirdly, the single most underrated player in the league's history, and easily one of the three best players the sport has ever seen.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Michael Jordan</h2>
<img class="wp-image-604709" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jordan-Mike-Nelson-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Out of all the weird factoids that came out of the Cavaliers' victory over the Warriors, perhaps none was more curious than the following. At age 31, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-history-michael-jordan-dunks-dikembe-mutombo.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> had been to three NBA Finals, while LeBron James, at the same age, had been to seven.

On one hand, this is true. On the other hand, it's virtually meaningless. Not only does age not particularly matter, since Jordan was an NCAA player and LeBron came from high school, but because you could easily reframe the facts to make all kinds of bumper-sticker-ready statements with a similar amount of depth to them; kind of like a very small lake after a very long drought.

Here's one for size: At age 31, LeBron James had lost four NBA Finals. Michael Jordan had lost none. And so on. The fact is that on the grand scale of basketball hoops, there are really only two tiers of players at the absolute summit of the game: the guys who are the best to have ever played it, and the guys at the very top of the very top of the pyramid.

James is in the first group, without a doubt, but Jordan, even with his midlife crisis-style (and Kareem, and Wilt, and Bill Russell) are in the second -- the most unimpeachable of the greats.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Bill Russell</h2>
<img class="wp-image-479638 aligncenter" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51685346.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Exactly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-and-6-athletes-with-5-or-more-mvp-awards.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 rings in 13 years</a>. The foundation of the greatest dynasty in NBA history. The dude who bested Wilt Chamberlain over and over and over again.

The advent of statistical analysis has been a blessing in some ways (to be resolutely reductive: "volume shooting is bad" is a good thing to be able to prove quantitatively) but a curse in other ways, particularly in the case of the two original <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great centers of the league</a> -- simply because no one was keeping track of the data at the time.

The most famous example in Russ's case are blocks, which weren't recorded until 1973, four years after he retired. However, that's hardly the only defensive measurement that matters (although if you're interested, there is at least one person attempting to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3s7rlj/heres_112_nba_games_where_shot_block_data_exists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quantify blocks for Bill Russell and Wilt</a> on Reddit using old newspaper box scores; he's also the person behind the truly astonishing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dantheman9758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilt Chamberlain Archive</a>); just the easiest to use an illustration that quantification has its limits, particularly when you talk about the original greats of the game.

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen Curry and the Warriors failed to become NBA champions in 2016. Now they have another chance. Here's why he'll suffer the same fate once again.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_658998" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658998" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Stephen-Curry-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images-640x413.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="489" /> Stephen Curry can't believe the Warriors lost in the 2016 NBA Finals | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

In the 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> Finals, a showdown featuring two league MVPs, the King <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came to play</a>, and the Chef fell flat. This is why the Cavaliers were able to overcome a 3-1 deficit and bring the city of Cleveland its first professional championship in 52 years. It's also why the Warriors can no longer stake the claim of the greatest team in NBA history. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/stephen-curry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a> knows this, and he explains <a href="http://theundefeated.com/features/this-one-hurts-for-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why it hurts</a>:
<blockquote>I’ll take it on the chin because I know I didn’t play my best. That’s something that I’ll have to deal with. That’s my own expectation and my own kind of self-assessment. I don’t need anybody else to tell me that. My team didn’t win. I didn’t play my best. That’s not going to be the end of the story. That’s just going to be a down chapter in the book.</blockquote>
With the way this Warriors team is constructed, common sense suggests that this recent hiccup will be just, as Curry puts it, "a down chapter." But what if it's not? What if faltering on the game's greatest stage -- or not even reaching -- becomes the status quo for the back-to-back MVP? This would be a hard pill to swallow. Yet, the way we see it, it's not out of the realm of possibility.

As crazy as this may sound, especially given the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/">offseason addition of a certain former MVP</a> -- we could see Curry never winning an NBA championship again. Here's a look at 10 reasons why.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Dubs don't have a true interior presence</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Warriors-and-Clippers-Sean-M.-Haffey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="528" /> LA's DeAndre Jordan battles for position against Golden State's Marreese Speights and Festus Ezeli | Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images[/caption]

No team in the NBA is better than the Warriors when it comes to a small-ball lineup. The Dubs practically started this revolution, and it's turned them into the most offensively explosive team in the league. But when you sacrifice size and physicality for smaller players who are more equipped to shoot from the outside, you set yourself up to get bullied on the boards (see the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 Finals</a>), exposed at the rim, and controlled in the post. These shortcomings, as we've seen, can come back to haunt you in the postseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Social media distractions</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Can refs get fined?</p>
— Ayesha Curry (@ayeshacurry) <a href="https://twitter.com/ayeshacurry/status/742567393277267969">June 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
We love the Curry family; we think they are great for the game of basketball. However, anything withs the potential to take the Chef's attention away from the task at hand, especially during the playoffs, is not a good recipe for his career. Winning a championship is not easy; obviously Curry knows this. But this isn't about winning just a single title, it's about raising multiple banners to the rafters. Distractions could easily prevent that from happening.

<h2>3. Lacking length</h2>

The absence of size hurt the Dubs in the 2016 NBA Finals. However, it was the lack of length that almost cost them the Western Conference. With ferocious perimeter defense, big bodies, and long arms, the Oklahoma City Thunder disrupted the Warriors' offense, contested practically every shot, and stuffed them to the tune of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-western-conference-finals-thunder-vs-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">43 blocks in the series</a>. Oklahoma City's length almost won it the series, but more importantly, Golden State's lack of length almost sent the team home early. Even with Kevin Durant joining the party, this could still be an issue moving forward.

<h2>4. Circus shots aren't as effective in the playoffs</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2v7VyhE9ig"></iframe>

Curry will probably go down as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-the-most-incredible-shots-of-his-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest shooter of all time</a>. In fact, with a portfolio full of incredible -- albeit questionable -- shots, he's easily already among the top snipers to ever play the game.

But while Steph tends to make the majority of his circus shots during the regular season -- which only intensifies the claim that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-right-steph-currys-shooting.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there is no such thing</a> as a "bad shot" for Curry -- when it comes to the playoffs, different rules apply. The competition is tighter, the games are more physical, and every possession counts just a bit more. That being the case, even the best shooters on the planet should think before just "letting it fly." There is such a thing as a "bad shot" -- even for Curry.

<h2>5. Not an excellent road team in the playoffs</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brandon-Rush-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="509" /> Brandon Rush reacts against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 3 of the 2016 WCF | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

It's never a bad thing to get home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, but that doesn't mean you can afford to be average on the road. During the 2016 postseason, the Dubs lost once in both Houston and Portland and fell twice while visiting the Thunder and the Cavs. That's a total of six road losses. This club <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/standings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost just seven games on the road</a> all season. Just saying.

<h2>6. Live by the three, die by the three</h2>
[caption id="attachment_606979" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-606979" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stephen-Curry-Sean-M.-Haffey-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Curry celebrates during a game against the Clippers | Sean M.

During the 2015<span class="s1">—</span>16 regular season, the Warriors <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shot 41.6% as a team</a> from beyond the arc, giving them the best three-point percentage in basketball for the second straight season. During the Finals, however, that number dipped to just 37.3%. When you're firing on all cylinders from long range, it's a beautiful thing to behold, and wildly entertaining for the fans. But when those shots stop falling as consistently, and that happens to be a team's bread and butter, it will be a problem.

<h2>7. Cleveland provided the blueprint</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-3.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James senses victory | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

There's only one LeBron James, so it's not as if every team in the league possesses an all-time great with the ability to singlehandedly (with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-top-5-point-guards-in-the-playoffs.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help of Kyrie Irving</a>) take over a game (well, series). However, this doesn't mean they can't <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cleveland-paid-team-eastern-conference.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn from the Cavs' formula</a> for toppling the champs.

When the Dubs go small, put your head down and take it to the basket. If you're a pick-and-roll team looking to take advantage of a mismatch, force Curry to switch onto the ball handler. These tactics aren't guaranteed to be successful all the time. However, as Cleveland showed, they work more often than not.

<h2>8. So much for team chemistry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595262" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595262" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Golden-State-Warriors-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="505" /> Golden State Warriors show of their championship rings | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The key to sustained success is chemistry and continuity. Prior to the start of free agency, Curry's Warriors had both of these things. Now, well, let's just say it's complicated. While the Dubs certainly got more talented with the addition of Durant, given how the franchise <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/contracts-warriors-built-best-team-nba.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently pays its players</a>, they were forced to move on from some key players in order to make the superstar's contract work. And that sort of "collateral damage" could come back to haunt Golden State in the future.

It's easy to feel as though losing the likes of Harrison Barnes (far right), Andrew Bogut (second from the right), and Festus Ezeli (far left) is a small price to pay for adding a top-five NBA talent, but make no mistake, this trade-off could, in fact, have dire consequences. Cohesion is a rare commodity in the National Basketball Association, Hopefully the Golden State Warriors didn't just damage theirs beyond repair.

<h2>9. When confidence turns to arrogance</h2>

Lacob (R) can't believe what's happening | Bruce Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

The Warriors have every reason to be excited about the team they put on the floor; they've built a great one. Yet, when the organization's confidence turns to arrogance, then you have a problem. And that's what we see from majority owner Joe Lacob.

It's one thing to call your team "<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/warriors-owner-not-shy-about-his-teams-superiority-over-entire-nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light year's ahead</a>" of the rest of the NBA when you put together a 73-win regular season, but when your squad blows a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, that's when you should probably show some humility. Instead, Lacob continues to preach how "<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/after-nba-finals-letdown-joe-lacob-is-somehow-still-bragging-about-the-warriors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forward thinking</a>" the franchise is and how it's already "on to the next idea." If we could provide him with a small piece of advice: Just stop.

<h2>10. Western Conference competition</h2>
[caption id="attachment_601370" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-601370" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kawhi-Leonard-San-Antonio-Spurs-v-Los-Angeles-xcYEcHYBCfXl-640x400.jpg" alt="10 Reasons Stephen Curry Will Never Win Another Championship" width="757" height="473" /> Kawhi Leonard is ready to ball | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

The competition in the Western Conference is fierce, deep, and full of potential road blocks for the Curry and the Golden State Warriors.

The San Antonio Spurs, led by Kawhi Leonard (who's only 24 years old), won 67 games this past season and continue to be among the most well-run organizations in all of professional sports (hello, they just added Pau Gasol). The Oklahoma City Thunder, almost (should've) knocked out the Dubs in last year's Western Conference Finals, and while KD has taken his talents to the Bay Area, there are no guarantees in the playoffs. Plus, we're not about to bet against a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/okc-rebuild-around-russell-westbrook.html/">ruthlessly determined</a> Russell Westbrook.

These clubs could pose a problem for the Warriors for years to come, making this arguably the greatest obstacle in the Golden State Warriors' quest to reach the top of the NBA mountain again.

		<description><![CDATA[For a short time, the NBA was content to let high schoolers make the jump to the highest level of the sport. These are the 7 best NBA players who did it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_745138" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745138" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kobe-Mark-Ralston-AFP-Getty-Images-640x475.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant dribbles." width="757" height="562" /> Kobe Bryant was absolutely one of the best NBA players to skip college ball. | Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/heres-how-the-nba-can-fix-the-ncaas-one-and-done-problem.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">society didn’t have to deal with the “one-and-done" moniker</a>. For a brief period, the National Basketball Association was content to let high schoolers make the jump to the highest level of the sport. It didn’t matter if these kids were ready. Whether they couldn’t get into college or thought they didn’t need it, no one was stopping them from making that major leap. Of course, this proved to have mixed results.

There is a big difference between being prepared to battle with the big boys and being in way over your head. History is littered with individuals who had no business taking the direct route to the NBA from high school. Remember Kwame Brown? Of course you do. The kid left Glynn Academy with all the promise in the world. He bypassed college, was selected first overall in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Washington Wizards, and proceeded to have a career that saw him average 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. That’s not exactly what you’re looking for from a 6-foot-11 center. Clearly he wasn’t ready to take his talents to the NBA.

Sometimes things did work out for these young hopefuls. Take Amar’e Stoudemire for example. He was the ninth overall pick in the 2002 draft and he’s put together a solid career. Stoudemire has made six All-Star Games and has career averages of 19 points and 8 rebounds per game. Had he not battled injuries over his 13-year career, the 6-foot-10 power forward may have made more than one All-NBA First Team.

Unfortunately, we’ll never know. The truth is, that’s the risk teams took when they opted to go with a kid straight from high school. Sometimes you end up with a Brown. Other times you end up with a Stoudemire. And sometimes, if you’re lucky, you end up with something much, much more.

With that, here’s a look at the seven best NBA players who came in straight from high school.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Tracy McGrady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_794073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tracy-McGrady-e1430248403611.jpg"><img class="wp-image-794073 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tracy-McGrady-e1430248403611.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="501" /></a> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

Tracy McGrady came to the NBA out of Mount Zion Christian Academy. The Toronto Raptors took him with the ninth overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft, and it wasn’t long before T-Mac became one of the most dominant scorers in the National Basketball Association. At 6-foot-8, the shooting guard-small forward combo was explosive above the rim and had ridiculous outside range.

From the 2000-2001 season until 2006-2007, McGrady made seven consecutive All-Star Games. During that span he also won two NBA scoring titles and was an All-NBA First Team selection twice. However, T-Mac was never able to reach his full potential due to a career consistently hampered by injuries. It was truly an <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-unfortunate-tale-t-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unfortunate tale</a>.

<h2>2. Shawn Kemp</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Olajuwon-and-Kemp-Pete-LEVINE-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="541" /> Shawn Kemp tries pass Houston Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon | Pete Leving/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Shawn Kemp was enrolled at Trinity Valley Community College, but he never stepped on the floor for the school. Therefore, when the Seattle SuperSonics selected him with the 17th pick in the 1989 draft, they were going strictly off his high school tape. And boy, did they make a good choice. During his prime, he was one of the best power forwards in the NBA, and was recognized as such by making six All-Star Games.

On top of that, Kemp was an absolute beast and a ferocious dunker. Let’s just say there was a reason they called him the “Reign Man." If you were guarding the paint and you saw Kemp coming your way, the move would be to stand aside. He had an affinity for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPvh7jdeeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting people on a poster</a>.

<h2>3. Dwight Howard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwight-Howard-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwight Howard walks off the floor during a game against the Spurs." width="757" height="457" /> Dwight Howard walks off the floor during a game against the Spurs. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

When the Orlando Magic took Dwight Howard with the first pick in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2004.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2004 NBA Draft</a>, they were hoping he’d grow into one of those rare two-way centers who can dominate on both ends of the floor. Mission accomplished. Over his 12 seasons in the NBA thus far, Howard is averaging 17.9 points, 12.7 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game.

He’s been to the All-Star Game eight times, won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award three times, and has been selected to the All-NBA First Team five times. The only real issue the Magic ever had with Howard was that he eventually no longer wanted to be part of the organization. Fortunately, the Houston Rockets have mostly enjoyed having Howard roam the paint for them these past threeseasons.

<h2>4. Kevin Garnett</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Kevin-Garnett-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="473" /> The game is going to miss Kevin Garnett | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Kevin Garnett paved the way for a new crop of high schoolers who went straight to the NBA when he was taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the fifth pick in the 1995 draft. Garnett was, and still is, all passion and intensity — a guy who truly wears his heart on his sleeve. He’s now been in the NBA for 20 years and has accomplished it all. He’s a 15-time All-Star, a nine-time All-Defensive First Team selection, a four-time All-NBA First Teamer, a Defensive Player of the Year, an MVP, and an NBA champion. When it comes to Garnett, nothing is impossible.

<h2>5. Moses Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_794076" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Moses-Malone--e1430248616370.jpg"><img class="wp-image-794076 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Moses-Malone--e1430248616370.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /></a> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Moses Malone became a member of the ABA’s <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTS/1975.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utah Stars</a> in 1974 after he was drafted out of Petersburg High School as a 19-year-old. His time in the NBA started in 1976, when the leagues merged, and he would turn into a dominant center during his second season with the Houston Rockets in 1977-1978.

Nicknamed “The Chairman of the Boards," Malone was a rebounding machine and would average 12.2 a game for his NBA career. On top of that, he averaged 20.6 points per contest, played in 12 All-Star Games, was a part of the All-NBA First Team four times, won three MVP awards, and took home the NBA championship in 1982-1983. Of course, who could forget that Malone is not just a member of the Hall of Fame, but also one of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 greatest players in NBA history</a>.

<h2>6. Kobe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="507" /> Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant during a game in 2014.| Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

If only the Charlotte Hornets knew what they were getting when they selected Kobe Bryant with the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft. Perhaps, then, they wouldn’t have traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade Divac. But that’s what ended up happening, and Bryant’s done nothing but put together a Hall of Fame career ever since.

The Black Mamba is a 18-time All-Star and one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history — his 33,412 career points puts him at No. 3 on the NBA all-time scoring list. Bryant’s won the scoring title twice, been a member of the All-NBA First Team 11 times, made the All-Defensive First Team nine times, and was MVP in 2007-2008. But let’s be honest: The thing that probably matters to Bryant the most is NBA championships. Fortunately for him, he’s got five of those bad boys.

<h2>7. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_794081" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James3-e1430248987793.jpg"><img class="wp-image-794081 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James3-e1430248987793.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="474" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

LeBron James was anointed “King James" even before the Cleveland Cavaliers took him with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, and he’s more than lived up to the name. With his absurdly high basketball IQ, Magic Johnson-like vision, and a body built like a freight train, James has risen to the top of the NBA elite.

Over his 13 years in the league, ‘Bron has averaged 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 points per game. He’s been to the All-Star Game 12 times, been named an All-NBA First Teamer nine times, and was a member of the All-Defensive First Team five times. James has also won the MVP award four times and secured back-to-back NBA championships, in 2012 and 2013. Every time he steps on the floor, there is a strong possibility you may end up witnessing greatness. And really, is there anything cooler than that?

		<description><![CDATA[We've seen many great teams throughout NBA history. However, some separate themselves from the rest. Here's a look at the 10 best NBA teams of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Can you truly determine which teams are, in fact, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-all-time-great-nba-basketball-players-by-position.html/">best in NBA history</a>? According to the fine people at FiveThirtyEight, you absolutely can. These folks are all about using statistical analyses to calculate objective answers. With regard to the best teams in NBA history, FiveThirtyEight determined their exact Elo rating. What’s that? We’re glad you asked. There is a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more detailed</a> explanation of this term, but simply put:
<blockquote>Elo is like the iPad of sports power ratings: Their design is quite simple, and they do a lot with a little, depending only on the final score of each game and where it was played. Teams always gain Elo points after winning games -- although more for upset wins and for winning by wider margins -- and lose ground after losing them. They account for both regular-season and playoff games.</blockquote>
When you want to dissect a team’s Elo rating, you only need to focus on the wins and losses. However, there is a lot that goes into those two categories. You must consider <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-smackdowns-in-nba-history.html/">the margin of victory</a>; whether the game was on the road; and the strength of the team’s opponent. You also have to consider so much more.

Fortunately, someone else did all the heavy lifting. Based on FiveThirtyEight’s calculations, if a team has an Elo rating over 1700, then that team is a legitimate contender. However, if a club scores over 1800, it's among the best of the best. If you don't like using statistics to come to this sort of conclusion, then you may not agree. But no matter what you think, this process certainly has merit. Based on Elo ratings, here’s a look at the 10 best NBA teams of all time.
<h2>10. 1997–98 Chicago Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804606" align="aligncenter" width="706"]<img class="wp-image-804606" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jordan-and-Rodman-e1432332251744.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman walk up the floor." width="706" height="545" /> Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman walk up the floor. | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1764

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 62-20

After finishing the regular season with a 62-20 record and going 15-6 in the postseason, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1998.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1997–98 Chicago Bulls</a> took home the NBA title, while completing the second three-peat in franchise history. This group, led by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/michael-jordan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> (who averaged 28.7 points in the regular season) was third in the NBA in opponents’ points per game (89.6), third in defensive rating (99.8), and ninth in offensive rating (107.7).

This team may have scored a composite Elo of 1764, however, at one point during the year this group achieved a peak Elo rating of 1788. When it was all said and done, these Bulls finished the year with an average Elo rating of 1719 and a season-ending tally of 1785. Of course, in the end, this team will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-games-of-michael-jordans-career.html/">always be remembered</a> for Jordan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRCTp57LQro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">game winner</a> against the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals.

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1992.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1991–92 Chicago Bulls</a> defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1992_finals_POR-CHI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1992 NBA Finals</a>. This win marked the second NBA championship in the organization’s history. The group had a peak Elo rating of 1782 and an average mark of 1759; they ended the season with a rating of 1762. This team averaged 109.9 points per game (fifth of 27) and led the NBA with an offensive rating of 115.5.

These Bulls were also talented on the defensive end of the floor, finishing the season with a defensive rating of 104.5 (fourth of 27) and only allowing opponents to score 99.5 points per affair (third of 27). With an eventual composite Elo of 1768, the 1991-92 Bulls played their way to the No. 9 position on the list of the best teams in NBA history.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1769

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 65-17

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2008–09 Los Angeles Lakers</a> were a dynamic bunch. This team finished the regular season with a 65-17 record, went 16-7 in the postseason, and took down the Orlando Magic in the NBA Finals in five games. At their best, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/">this Lakers unit</a> would have a 1790 Elo rating, which also represented the team’s season-ending rating. However, throughout the season, this group had an average Elo score of 1726.

This group was third in the NBA in offensive efficiency (112.8 rating) and sixth in the league in defensive efficiency (104.7 rating). After the Lakers suffered a disappointing loss in the finals <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-champions-who-failed-to-repeat.html/">the season before</a>, this team became the group that finally helped <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant</a> return to the top of the NBA mountain.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1776

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 67-15

The offseason addition of LaMarcus Aldridge (18 PPG and 8.5 RPG) may have helped the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015–16 San Antonio Spurs</a> reach a peak Elo rating of 1800 and finish the year with a final regular-season mark of 67-15. However, he wasn't able to help the team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-nba-teams-have-the-longest-active-playoff-streaks-2.html/">achieve its ultimate goal</a>: an NBA championship. Still, the numbers don't lie; these Spurs, statistically speaking, are one of the best teams ever.

Under the sensational guidance of coach Gregg Popovich, the Spurs limited the opposition to just 92.9 points per game (first of 30), finished with the best defensive rating (99) in the NBA. According to FiveThirtyEight, they had a season-ending Elo rating of 1759 to go along with an average tally of 1768. Had this group <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship.html/">not been eliminated</a> by the OKC Thunder in the Western Conference semifinals, contributing to a composite Elo mark of 1776, perhaps it'd rank higher than No. 7 on the list.

K.C. Jones coached this <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1986.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1985–86 Boston Celtics</a> team to a 67-15 regular-season finish, a 15-3 record in the playoffs, and eventual championship over the Houston Rockets. Led by Larry Bird (25.8 points and 9.8 rebounds per game) and Kevin McHale (21.3 points and 8.1 rebounds per game), this group had the third-best offensive rating in the league (111.8) and the best defensive rating (102.6).

The peak Elo rating for this team was 1816. However, it finished the season with a rating of 1801 and, throughout the season, ended up with an average mark of 1735. And yet, by managing to have a composite Elo rating of 1784, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-boston-celtics-in-nba-history.html/">these Celtics</a> are easily among the best teams of all time.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1796

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 67-15

Led by the great <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/stephen-curry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a>, the most recent NBA Champion <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2015.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014–15 Golden State Warriors</a> are easily the most interesting case on this entire list. As pointed out by FiveThirtyEight, “They may rise or fall a couple of slots depending on how the rest of the playoffs go…"

Heading into Game 4 of the 2015 Western Conference Finals the Warriors had a composite Elo rating of 1773, based on a peak score of 1791, an average Elo of 1737, and an end rating of 1791. At the time, these numbers put the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-6-greatest-golden-state-warriors-of-all-time.html/">Golden State Warriors</a> in the fourth position.

However, by destroying the Rockets (115-80) in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, the Warriors reached a new <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/the-complete-history-of-every-nba-team-by-elo/#warriors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peak Elo rating of 1813</a>. With this score, the Warriors’ season-ending mark increased and the team’s average Elo jumped to 1738. After they demolished Cleveland, the Dubs finished up with an Elo of 1796, making them the fifth-best team in NBA history.

It will take some time, and the appropriate degree of nostalgia, before we can really place this group among the greatest NBA teams of all time. Still, no matter how things eventually play out, we can't deny the talent of this championship-winning squad.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1798

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 73-9

Even as the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015–16 Golden State Warriors</a> achieved history by compiling a now-record 73 regular-season victories, we claimed that they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-the-warriors-arent-the-best-team-in-nba-history-yet.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still weren't the best team ever</a>. This argument became further etched in stone once the Dubs blew a 3-1 lead to Cavs in the NBA Finals, failing to capture a second straight title and shot at immortality. Little did we know, however, just how much this stumble would affect their place in history.

Based on FiveThirtyEight's numbers, the Warriors' finished the year with a composite Elo rating of 1798, placing them at No. 4 on the all-time list. Despite setting the bar for regular-season excellence, the Dubs' season-ending Elo rating of 1756 dragged everything down, preventing Golden State from even earning a spot in the top three.

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1997.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1996–97 Chicago Bulls</a> were an impressive squad, especially on the offensive end of the floor. This group led the NBA in points per game (103.1) and offensive efficiency (114.4). With a regular-season record of 69-13 and a postseason mark of 15-4, it’s no surprise that Chicago ended up with a composite Elo rating of 1802.

At its best, this club reached a peak mark of 1811. However, throughout the season, the Bulls had an average rating of 1792 and ended the year with a tally of 1802. Still, this Bulls group <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-nba-finals-performances-of-all-time.html/">was a force to be reckoned with</a>, and the Utah Jazz had <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-nba-finals-of-the-last-25-years.html/">no answer for them</a> -- losing in the NBA Finals in six games.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1815

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 72-10

If you take Elo ratings out of the equation, most people would agree that the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1996.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1995–96 Chicago Bulls</a> are the best team in NBA history. This group achieved a <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/features/moment-1996-bulls-70/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">then-record 72 regular-season wins</a> and, of course, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-michael-jordans-finals-appearances.html/">tied its season up</a> with a pretty bow by defeating the Seattle SuperSonics in the finals in six games.

This team averaged 105.2 points per game (first of 29), allowed 92.9 points per contest (third of 29), had the top offensive rating in the league (115.2). <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-chicago-bulls-of-all-time.html/">This Chicago team</a> was also the most defensively efficient bunch in the NBA (101.8 defensive rating). However, we are supposed to look at the Elo rating. And wouldn’t you know it, this group dominated in that respect as well.

Chicago ended up with a composite Elo rating of 1815. It got to this point by having a peak rating of 1853, an average score of 1770, and a season-ending rating of 1823.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Blend Elo</span>: 1828

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final regular-season record</span>: 67-15

Based on Elo ratings alone, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2017.html">2016–17 Golden State Warriors</a> are the greatest team of all time. This group, which finished 67-15 in the regular season and went 16-1 in the playoffs, averaged 115.9 points per game (first of 30) and had the top offensive rating (115.6) and the second-best defensive rating (104) in the league this season.

On their way to winning a second title in three seasons, the Dubs had the highest peak Elo rating (1865) ever posted; an average score of 1772; and an end-of-the-year Elo rating of 1846 (also the best in history). With the addition of Kevin Durant to an already stacked Warriors roster, the 2017 NBA champs amassed a blended Elo rating -- or a composite rating -- of 1828, topping the high mark previously held by the 1995–96 Bulls.

Despite putting together one of the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-top-3-march-madness-performances.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jaw-dropping individual performances</a> in NCAA tournament history, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/stephen-curry/">Stephen Curry</a> was still not considered a slam dunk <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> prospect coming out of college. It's funny how things change.

With his filthy jumper, smooth handle, and unlimited range, Chef Curry has taken the National Basketball Association by storm to become one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-the-most-incredible-shots-of-his-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most incredible players</a> on the planet. This past season saw him lead the Golden State Warriors to 73 regular-season wins and earn his second straight Most Valuable Player award, including becoming the first unanimous pick ever. Given what Curry's been able to accomplish so far in his NBA career, it's hard to believe that six players were selected before him in the 2009 NBA Draft. Unfortunately, it happened -- and many teams have been kicking themselves ever since.

In honor of Curry's undeniable dominance, we've decided to take a look back at the 2009 draft to see which players were selected before the two-time league MVP as well as examine where they happen to be now. Trust us, this is something you won't want to miss.

<h2>Then: Blake Griffin, PF, Oklahoma</h2>
[caption id="attachment_616590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-616590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Blake-Griffin-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-640x461.jpg" alt="The 6 Players Picked Before Stephen Curry in the 2009 NBA Draft" width="757" height="546" /> Blake Griffin doing work with the Oklahoma Sooners. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 1
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Los Angeles Clippers

It's hard to argue with the Los Angeles Clippers selecting Blake Griffin with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. In his two seasons at Oklahoma, Griffin shot 61.8% from the field, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/blake-griffin-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">averaged 18.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game</a>, and was a Consensus First-Team All-American in 2008–09. His college career would end with a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/blake-griffin-highlights-top-3-march-madness-performances.html/">highlight reel showing in the NCAA tournament</a> along with a handful of individual honors, including the Naismith Award, the Wooden Award, and the AP Player of the Year award.

<h2>Now: Blake Griffin</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Los Angeles Clippers

Aside from suffering a few injuries here and there, Griffin has been everything the Clippers had hoped he would be. In his six seasons in Los Angeles, the power forward has averaged 21. 9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game, made five All-Star Game appearances, and earned All-NBA honors on four separate occasions. Now all that's left to do is help the Clippers get out of the Western Conference. We're sure Curry will have something to say about that.

<h2>Then: Hasheem Thabeet, C, Connecticut</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNkgVhq_oH8"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 2
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Memphis Grizzlies

Although Hasheem Thabeet was never a dominant player in college, the Memphis Grizzlies were clearly banking on his upside when they took him with the No. 2 overall pick.

In his three seasons at UConn, the 7-foot-3 center <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/hasheem-thabeet-1.html">averaged 10.3 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 4.2 blocks per game while shooting 61.1% from the field</a>. Had it not been for a junior campaign in which the former Huskies standout put up 13.6 points and 10.8 rebounds a night while earning Second-Team All-American honors and winning the Big East Player of the Year, the Grizzlies probably would not have taken him this high.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Now: Hasheem Thabeet</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640521" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640521" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Hasheem-Thabeet-of-the-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-640x386.jpg" alt="Hasheem Thabeet of the Oklahoma City Thunder scores under pressure from Wesley Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers during their NBA matchup at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on March 9, 2014.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Unemployed

If it was possible, the Grizzlies would definitely ask for a mulligan on this pick.

Thabeet played just 113 games in Memphis (starting only 13 of them), averaging a pathetic 3.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, 1.3 blocks a night, before being shipped off to the Houston Rockets in the 2010–11 season. In the end, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thabeha01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thabeet's NBA career</a> would see him play for four teams over five seasons, his last with the OKC Thunder in 2013–14. It's no wonder he's considered one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-the-worst-second-overall-picks-in-nba-history.html/">worst second overall picks</a> in NBA history.

<h2>Then: James Harden, SG, Arizona State</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ul4i5CGJM20"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 3
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Oklahoma City Thunder

It only took <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/james-harden-1.html">two seasons at Arizona State</a> for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/james-harden/">James Harden</a> to establish himself as a player with superstar potential. During his time with the Sun Devils, The Beard averaged 19 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game and was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year in 2008–09. The Oklahoma City Thunder were wise to select the First-Team All-American with the No. 3 overall pick. The question is, do they regret eventually trading him?

<h2>Now: James Harden</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Houston Rockets

Although Harden was more than solid during his three seasons in OKC, he's really thrived since becoming "the man" in Houston in 2012–13. As a member of the Rockets, he's <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html">averaged 25.7 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game</a>, made four All-Star teams, and earned All-NBA honors three times.

From an individual standpoint, Harden is easily one of the top players in the National Basketball Association. As far as being a solid teammate is concerned, however, that's when things get a bit complicated.

<h2>Then: Tyreke Evans, SG, Memphis</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XprFPLHhhUM

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 4
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Sacramento Kings

Tyreke Evans made the jump to the NBA after one season at Memphis. Looking back now, it's hard not to consider this pick a bit of a reach. Then again, it was an <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/tyreke-evans-1.html">impressive freshman season</a>.

Evans shot 45.5% from the field, knocked down 71.1% of his free throws, and averaged 17.1 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. Still, all that promise he showed during his lone season with the Tigers hasn't exactly translated to the next level on a consistent basis.

<h2>Now: Tyreke Evans</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: New Orleans Pelicans

Evans' lack of consistency can be attributed to his struggles with injuries. However, when he's managed to stay on the court, he has been a productive NBA player.

While he was drafted by the Kings and played four seasons there, he was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans back in 2013.

Evans <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansty01.html">averaged 17.5 points per game with the Kings</a> and has since put 15.5 points a night with the Pelicans. He's improved his assists and rebounds since being dealt to the Pelicans. After averaging 4.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds with the Kings over his four years, he's bumped those numbers to six assists and five rebounds with the Pelicans. While those are nice figures, they're not exactly on Curry's level.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Then: Ricky Rubio, PG, Spain</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHsCyDm3M54"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 5
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Minnesota Timberwolves

Selecting Ricky Rubio with the No. 5 overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft was considered one of the most exciting moves of the entire draft. In Rubio, the Minnesota Timberwolves saw a point guard with tremendous upside who just needed some time to adjust to the American game. It was one of the most exciting picks of the entire draft. Rubio's upside was tremendous, but he had a whole lot to prove. Unfortunately, while the T-Wolves had hoped to get Rubio over as quickly as possible, he didn't make the move until the 2011 season.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Now: Ricky Rubio</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ricky-Rubio-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ricky Rubio #9 looking to drop dimes. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="474" /> Ricky Rubio #9 looking to drop dimes. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Minnesota Timberwolves

When he hasn't been battling injuries, Rubio has been among the most effective points guards in the NBA. Over his five-year career with the Timberwolves, Rubio has <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rubiori01.html">averaged 10.1 points, 8.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds</a> and is one of the better pure passers in the league. Still, that doesn't change the fact that Minnesota would prefer to have Curry in a Wolves uniform.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Then: Jonny Flynn, PG, Syracuse</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqZlB4VoceU"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pick</span>: No. 6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Minnesota Timberwolves

For reasons beyond our comprehension, the Minnesota Timberwolves, who had just selected Rubio at No. 5, decided to take another point guard with the sixth overall pick. Instead of going with Curry, they opted for Jonny Flynn, an electrifying playmaker who averaged 16.6 points and six assists per game in two seasons at Syracuse. Big mistake.

Unfortunately, Flynn lasted just two seasons in Minnesota, averaging 10.2 points and four assists, and then played for two other teams over the next two seasons in Portland and Houston. Over those two years, he played in a combined 29 games, and averaged no more than 5.2 points and 3.8 assists per game. He hasn't played another game in the NBA since the end of the 2011–12 season.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Unemployed

Flynn lasted just two seasons in Minnesota, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/f/flynnjo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">averaging 10.2 points and four assists per game</a>, before being dealt to Houston in 2011–12 (where he only lasted 11 games prior to being traded again, this time to the Portland Trail Blazers). He hasn't played in the NBA since the end of the 2011–12 season. Ouch.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_624041" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-624041" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dennis-Rodman-and-Dikembe-Mutombo-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="A referee attempts to separate Dennis Rodman (L) and Dikembe Mutombo." width="757" height="533" /> Dennis Rodman (L) and Dikembe Mutombo need to be separated on the court | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

At what point does <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/are-you-not-entertained-exciting-players-nba-today.html/">playing gritty, scrappy ball</a> cross the line? For one thing, there is certainly a difference between a dirty player and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-hated-villains-in-the-history-of-the-nba.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a villain</a>. And it’s an important distinction. The NBA’s villains know that their play agitates their opponents, but that means nothing to them. This is how they make a living, and nothing will keep them from it. However, when a player’s “chippiness" goes too far, then it seems perfectly reasonable to call that player dirty.

We don’t think, say, Matthew Dellavedova (who made waves during the playoffs last year with his "scrappy" on-court attitude) is that kind of player. But there have been some standouts over the years. With that, here’s who we believe represent the 10 dirtiest players in NBA history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Charles Oakley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805603" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805603 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charles-Oakley-e1432730941185.jpg" alt="Charles Oakley pushes an opponent away from the ball." width="757" height="503" /> Charles Oakley never backed down | Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

When you played against Charles Oakley, you knew what you were getting yourself into <span class="s1">--</span> <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-of-the-most-memorable-brawls-in-basketball-history.html/">a physical war</a>. In his 19 seasons in the NBA, it didn’t matter whether the power forward/center was suiting up for the New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards, Chicago Bulls, or Houston Rockets, Oakley would make sure his presence was felt. If you were soft on the court, The Oak Tree would destroy you. He wasn’t afraid of the forceful foul, and he wasn’t afraid to fight. You can ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5tQN7Wvqac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Charles</a> about that.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Karl Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805605" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805605 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Karl-Malone-e1432731064467.jpg" alt="Karl Malone puts his hands on his hips and looks down at the referee." width="757" height="550" /> Karl Malone knew how to throw elbows | Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Another intimidating force on the basketball court: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-big-men-of-all-time.html/">Karl Malone</a>. The 6-foot-9, 250-pound <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nba-power-forwards-of-all-time.html/">power forward</a> for the Utah Jazz was built like an absolute freight train. The Mailman may be a Hall of Famer and second place on the all-time NBA scoring list (36,928 points). However, he did much more than deliver buckets. Malone delivered elbows. He crushed Detroit Piston Isiah Thomas with one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-feuds-in-nba-history.html/">more vicious blows in NBA history</a>. To this day, Thomas definitely still remembers. This is what he told Terry Foster of <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140321/SPORTS0102/303210036#ixzz2wbGRqdYM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Detroit News</a>:

“I think it was the dirtiest play I have experienced in the game of basketball in my life.” Thomas said of the play, which happened on a Pistons pick-and-roll with Malone rotating to cover the middle. “I don’t think I’ve seen anything as vicious and as intentional to a player. I still don’t understand it.”

New rule: Always, always stay away from Malone’s elbows.

<h2>3. John Stockton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805607" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805607 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John-Stockton1-e1432731204234.jpg" alt="John Stockton shoves a Chicago Bulls player." width="757" height="531" /> John Stockton was more than scrappy | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Malone was not the only member of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-nba-players-1990s.html/">that famed Utah Jazz team</a> to play dirty. Point guard <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-nba-players-to-never-win-a-championship.html/">John Stockton</a> was also considered among the dirtiest players to step onto the hardwood. However, the difference between the two was that Stockton got away with it. People know Stockton as the guy with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-8-greatest-nba-passers-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most assists</a> in the history of the game. But only those who paid close attention saw him for what he truly was: a scrappy player (or if you <a href="http://www.nba.com/video/channels/nba_tv/2011/11/29/opencourt_nemesis.nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take Steve Kerr’s word for it</a>, “a dirty bastard").

Stockton would fight for every inch; he'd set illegal screens; and he’d never hesitate to give you a shot to the torso. But he was rarely caught doing anything wrong. That’s what made Stockton such a tough player; he was super smart on the basketball court. However, it doesn’t mean he wasn’t afraid to get dirty like everyone else.

<h2>4. Rick Mahorn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805610" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805610 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rick-Mahorn-e1432731486499.jpg" alt="Rick Mahorn claps and shouts as he sits on the bench." width="757" height="795" /> Rick Mahorn was not afraid to get rough | Tom Mihalek/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

People dubbed the Detroit Pistons of the late '80s and early '90s the "<a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=badboys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Boys</a>." If you’re curious to know which member of this group was considered the “baddest of the bunch," then look no further than power forward/center Rick Mahorn. What Mahorn lacked in scoring ability <span class="s1">-- </span>only averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mahorri01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6.9 points per game</a> for his career <span class="s1">-- </span>he made up with physicality.

Mahorn was a beast, who would not be denied. He wasn’t as athletic as most of his opponents <span class="s1">-- </span>he certainly couldn’t jump as high. However, he would fight for that ball and do whatever it took to get it. That’s how he played. That’s what people expected. That’s why he’s on this list.

<h2>5. Kurt Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_759947" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-759947" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kurt-Thomas-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kurt Thomas looks down at the referee, who tries to hold him back." width="757" height="529" /> Kurt Thomas is not afraid to get physical | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Kurt Thomas wasn't on the court to get buckets. He was on the floor to make his presence known, get physical with the opposition, and pick up fouls -- he averaged 3.2 per game for his career -- if need be. These are just some the reasons why the former 10th overall pick remained in the league until he was 40; it certainly wasn't because of his talent. Also, one of his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-nicknames-ever.html/">nicknames</a> happened to be "Dirty Kurt." So, there's another strike against him.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Metta World Peace</h2>
[caption id="attachment_759942" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-759942" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Metta-World-Peace-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x462.jpg" alt="Metta World Peace angrily points his finger at the referee." width="757" height="546" /> Don't mess with Metta World Peace | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Metta World Peace, or as his friends like to call him "Ron," never backed down from confrontation. We saw him go into the stands during the "Malice at the Palace," and we witnessed him "accidentally" hit James Harden in the head with an elbow. We also saw him get the job done by "bodying" opponents and rattling them through the use of psychological warfare.

To some, World Peace, ironically, was nothing more than a goon. However, we'd like to think he was more self aware than that. Was he afraid to play dirty? Nope. Did he know his style of play bothered opponents? Yep. Did he care? What do you think?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Dennis Rodman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_535413" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-535413 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dennis-Rodman-Jon-Ruthroff-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dennis Rodman argues with a referee." width="757" height="528" /> Dennis Rodman wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty | Jon Ruthroff/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

We all knew <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nba-power-forwards-of-all-time.html/">Dennis Rodman</a> would make this list. Sure, he may have been one of the greatest rebounders the game has ever seen, but that doesn't mean he got the job done "cleanly." Rodman wasn't afraid of contact and he attacked the glass with reckless abandonment. He pushed opponents, got extra physical when necessary, and loved nothing more than getting in someone's head through taunting. In short, he was "Dennis the Menace."

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Reggie Evans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_759953" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-759953" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Reggie-Evans-Bruce-Bennett-Getty-Images-640x441.jpg" alt="Reggie Evans yells at his opponents." width="757" height="522" /> Reggie Evans isn't afraid to play dirty | Bruce Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

Reggie Evans was an excellent rebounder; the numbers back this up. However, his NBA career is not defined by this fact. His NBA career is defined by the fact that he was an ultra physical player, was never afraid to mix it up, and, on at least one occasion, took things a bit to far. Just ask Chris Kaman, who had the misfortune of being on the receiving end of one of Evans' more "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOw_ogBVmdo">handsy</a>"moments.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Bruce Bowen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_759936" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-759936" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bruce-Bowen-Lisa-Blumenfeld-Getty-Images-640x422.jpg" alt="Bruce Bowen argues a call with the refs." width="757" height="499" /> Bruce Bowen definitely did something wrong here | Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images[/caption]

Don't let Bruce Bowen's above expression fool you; he knows exactly what he did. As one of the game's great defenders, Bowen did whatever it took to keep his opponents from scoring. He grabbed jerseys and pushed individuals from behind, and he did all this in an ultra-discreet manner. Yet, what made Bowen super dirty was the fact that he stuck his foot under shooters when they were in the middle of their jump shot, which led to tons of ankle injuries. Not cool, Bruce. Not cool.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Bill Laimbeer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_535414" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-535414" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bill-Lambeer-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Bill Laimbeer stands on the court with his hands on his hips." width="757" height="503" /> Bill Laimbeer definitely played a physical brand of basketball | Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

Bill Laimbeer was another member of the “Bad Boys" who most certainly deserve a place on this list. He was physical, he took cheap shots, and he wasn’t afraid to flop on the play. His aggressive style of play did not sit well with other members of the league. But that never bothered Laimbeer. The truth was, he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/07/sports/basketball-gamesmanship-or-dirty-play.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrived off of it</a>:
<blockquote>A lot of basketball is mental. Some people find the way I play very frustrating. They can’t handle it. I throw them off their game. I’m playing to win, and I’ll use all my tools both physically and mentally to win the game. Other players don’t like that and I can’t help that. I have to do what I do best. I call it gamesmanship.</blockquote>
Call it gamesmanship. Call it dirty play. Call it whatever you want. The simple fact still remains, there was no one like Bill Laimbeer.

		<description><![CDATA[In the NBA, there are some big men with massive feet, but it's not only the seven-footers who need custom shoes. Although, truthfully, it mainly is.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Obviously not many NBA players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go around bragging</a> about the size of their shoes, but let's be honest: When you see a player who's seven-feet-tall and has shoes that are bigger than your forearm, it will catch some attention. You can bet that throughout the NBA, there are some big men who have massively large feet, and we're going to check out nine of the largest today.

Full disclosure: a shocker on this list happens to be one of the biggest stars on the planet; a 6-foot-11 scoring machine who's controversial signing in the summer of 2016 nearly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/">broke Twitter</a>. Let's just say not only is this man "Golden," he also has gigantic feet.
<h2>9. Andre Iguodala</h2>
[caption id="attachment_545362" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-545362" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Andre-Iguodala-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Size 20 Shoes? 9 NBA Players With the Biggest Feet" width="757" height="542" /> Andre Iguodala celebrates after knocking down a triple. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

To be brutally honest, Iguodala doesn't make this list because his shoes are size 18 or larger. He makes this list because of the fact that he's 6-foot-6 and has crazy big feet for someone of that height. There's been a debate on his actual shoe size, but it's either a 16.5 or a 17. Either way, that's huge for a guy who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-3-and-d-players-in-the-nba-right-now.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can play shooting guard</a> if needed. Iguodala can jump out of the gym, and his big feet help him out with that.

<h2>8. Dwight Howard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_714773" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-714773" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dwight-Howard-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwight scores a bucket." width="757" height="540" /> Dwight Howard hopes things work out in Atlanta. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Welcome to the size-18 club, Dwight. Howard may be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-dwight-howard-return-la-lakers.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">headed to his fourth NBA team</a> in his career in 2016, but that doesn't change the fact that he's still a pretty talented big man. Howard is a great rebounder, averaging 12.7 per game in his career, while posting 2.1 blocks as well.

We probably shouldn't be all that surprised by the fact that Jordan has huge feet. He's 6-foot-11 and can jump out of the gym. At times, Jordan simply looks like a man against boys when posting someone up or flying to throw down an alley-oop. As for his shoe size, he's rocking size 18s.

<h2>6. Kevin Durant</h2>

Here's that surprise we were talking about. Kevin Durant, who's undoubtedly one of the best players in the game today, actually has huge feet. To this point in his stellar career, he's averaged 27.4 points, seven rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game. Shoe size? Just as big as DeAndre 3000, rocking a size 18.

<h2>5. Yao Ming</h2>
[caption id="attachment_620062" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-620062" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Yao-Ming_Retired-640x427.jpg" alt="Yao Ming is all smiles." width="757" height="505" /> Yao Ming watches from the sideline in retirement. | Lintao Zhang/Getty Images[/caption]

We all know and love Yao Ming. While he wasn't able to return after a foot injury in the 2009<span class="s1">–</span>10 season, this is a guy who was not only crazy tall at 7-foot-6, but he was also a great basketball player. He averaged 19 points and 9.2 rebounds over his NBA career. As you can guess, for a guy who's as tall as Ming, he also has gigantic feet, wearing a size 18.

<h2>4. Robin Lopez</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658454" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658454" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Robin-Lopez-New-York-Knicks--640x429.jpg" alt="Robin Lopez #8 of the New York Knicks shoots the ball during the game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on April 12, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

While Robin Lopez has played for five different NBA teams to this point in his career, and has had some mixed results over his nine years in the league, we still have good news. Lopez has gigantic feet as well, coming in with size 20 shoes.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Brook Lopez</h2>
[caption id="attachment_770456" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-770456" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Brook-Lopez-Michael-Reaves-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Brook Lopez celebrates hitting a shot" width="757" height="505" /> You can only do this if you have big feet. | Michael Reaves/Getty Images[/caption]

We'll keep it in the family here as we move on to Robin's brother, Brook, who has spent his entire career to this point with the Nets. Take a wild guess at what size shoe Brook wears? Here's a hint: He and his brother have a lot in common, including shoe size. Lopez, like his brother, wears size 20.

<h2>2. Bob Lanier</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658453" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658453" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Basketball-Hall-of-Fame-Magic-Johnson-Larry-Bird-Bob-Lanier-640x431.jpg" alt="David Stern (not pictured), inductee, speaks while presenters Larry Bird, Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, Bob Lanier, and NBA contributor Russ Granik listen during the 2014 Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony at Symphony Hall on August 8, 2014 in Springfield, Massachusetts. (Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)" width="757" height="509" /> Bob Lanier (R) needs big shoes. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

While Lanier hasn't played since 1984, this doesn't change the fact that he has some ridiculously huge feet; size 22 shoes to be exact. The big man who averaged 20.1 points and 10.1 rebounds per game over his 15-year NBA career was not only a great player, but he's just another example of players over seven-feet-tall who rock huge shoes.

<h2>1. Shaquille O'Neal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751114" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751114" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shaquille-ONeal-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Shaquille O'Neal cashed in during his playing days." width="757" height="523" /> Shaquille O'Neal's feet, like his personality, are huge. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Alright, when it comes to Shaq, you had to know he'd be on this list. This is a guy who played 20 NBA seasons and averaged 23.7 points and 10.9 rebounds. As amazing as he's been on the actual court, his foot size is pretty mind-blowing as well. O'Neal wears a size 22 shoe, which is probably around double the size of an average American male's foot size, we'd have to assume. Shaq Daddy, you never cease to amaze.

		<description><![CDATA[There is no move more identified with basketball than the dunk. Here are 10 dunkers who personified the move through the history of the NBA.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_790037" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-790037 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Vince-Carter-Otto-Greule-Jr.-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vince Carter shows off his mad dunk skills." width="757" height="520" /> Vince Carter shows why he's one of the greatest dunkers ever | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Many may view it as a dying art, but the slam dunk <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-dunks-nba-finals.html/">remains a wondrous spectacle</a> on the basketball court. Viewers and critics fall in and out of love with the dunk over the decades; some <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dunks-in-the-history-of-the-nba-slam-dunk-contest.html/">consider it a skill</a>, some consider it a classless way to show up an opponent. (The NCAA even banned dunking between 1967 and 1976.) With time, the slam dunk grew to be associated with many of the more memorable moments in league history.

There are, of course, the all-time greats in dunking; the guys who knew how to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-history-taj-gibson-dunks-on-dwyane-wade.html/">strike the right balance</a> between showmanship and skill. It's hard to pare down the list, but in the end a couple legends burn just a little bit brighter. Here are the top 10 greatest dunkers of all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Tracy McGrady</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWKaCiIhG0w"></iframe>
The 2000s kicked off with an NBA Dunk Contest for the ages. The competition came down to Toronto Raptors teammates and cousins, Vince Carter and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-players-who-came-in-straight-from-high-school.html/">Tracy McGrady</a>. McGrady was the runner-up and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nba-players-whose-careers-ended-too-soon.html/">never won the contest</a>. However, he's still considered one of the best dunkers in the history of the game <span class="s1">-- </span>and for good reason. His two-handed dunk received a perfect score. It's still referenced in current dunk contest scenarios.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Spud Webb</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fk-t2HnXfy4"></iframe>
Of course, part of the wonder of guard Spud Webb winning the 1986 NBA Dunk Contest came from the fact that he was a wee bit shorter than the rest of his competitors. But height clearly didn’t stop Webb from dominating the scene. He floated up to the basket better than players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-big-men-of-all-time.html/">much taller than him</a>. The legend of Webb’s Dunk Contest win lives on today, especially since the retired point guard can still dunk on guys taller than him.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Clyde Drexler</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yB5rpspXLog"></iframe>
Clyde Drexler easily tops the list of dunkers who never <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-in-nba-all-star-history.html/">won the NBA Dunk Contest</a>, especially because it's what he's most known for. He put his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-shooting-guards-of-all-time.html/">skills on the NBA court</a> as a 21-year-old rookie, fresh out of the University of Houston, with a resume boasting time with the “Phi Slamma Jamma” teams. We must acknowledge, however, the list of players who “Clyde the Glide” lost to: Larry Nance, Dominique Wilkins, Kenny Walker, and Michael Jordan (twice).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Darryl Dawkins</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5j0KDzb1LA"></iframe>
It should probably be illegal to talk about great dunks without mentioning Darryl Dawkins and his glass-shattering abilities. Self-named “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-best-nicknames-in-nba-history.html/">Chocolate Thunder</a>,” he'd been in the league a few years before an infamous incident in Kansas City on November 13, 1979.

Dawkins dunked the ball so hard that the fiberglass backboard exploded into oblivion. The spectacle grew in notoriety as he made another backboard his victim just a couple weeks later in Philadelphia. Hoops fans can thank the maneuver for the next move by the NBA <span class="s1">-- </span>installing shatter-proof backboards with breakaway rims in all arenas.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Larry Nance</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B64lWjwOpmY"></iframe>
Long before his son dunked on Brook Lopez for the LA Lakers, Larry Sr. put on the original dunk show. In fact, he won the first NBA Dunk Contest. In the inaugural competition in 1984, Nance went toe-to-toe with legend Erving, one of the top five greatest dunkers to ever grace the game. Impressively, the young Phoenix Suns forward emerged the victor, in a moment that even had Erving cheering along with the crowd.

<h2>5. Dominique Wilkins</h2>

Also known as the Human Highlight Reel, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-remembering-the-1996-97-spurs-and-how-they-built-a-dynasty.html/">Wilkins</a> was most notable for his windmill slams. Out on the open floor, he would fill the wing in transition, where he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-small-forwards-of-all-time.html/">was the preferred target</a> of point guard Doc Rivers in Atlanta.

To showcase his skills, ‘Nique participated in five Slam Dunk Contests, winning two of these competitions in 1985 and 1990. In doing so, Wilkins faced off against the likes of Nance, Shawn Kemp, Walker, Webb, Julius Erving, and Jordan in what many considered a heyday for the dunk.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Shawn Kemp</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HQeMhYJe5JA"></iframe>
Shawn Kemp declared for the 1989 NBA Draft as a 19-year-old without playing one minute of college basketball. As a young, raw athlete, Kemp simply <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/seattle-sonics-oklahoma-city-thunder.html/">outran and out-jumped</a> the competition for show-stopping dunks, blocks, and easy put-backs. The Man Child would rip down a rebound, put the ball on the floor, and drive coast-to-coast as a one-man fast break for hammer dunks. With time, Kemp added a consistent jump shot and a solid mix of post moves to his offensive repertoire.

<h2>3. Julius Erving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_790014" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-790014 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dr.-J-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Julius Erving smiles on the sidelines." width="757" height="541" /> Julius Erving smiles on the sidelines | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The fact that Dr. J performed as a well-rounded player <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/former-nba-stars-compare-lebron-james.html/">who led perennial contenders</a> is somewhat lost in the shuffle behind his array of dazzling athletic feats. His dunk was, of course, a highlight of his playing resume.

In 1977, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWLXcg-V8FI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">split the entire Portland defense</a> on a coast-to-coast drive before climbing the ladder and jamming the ball down into Bill Walton’s face in Game 6 of the NBA finals. In 1983, Erving won a footrace against Michael Cooper for a loose ball at mid-court. On the break, Dr. J cradled the basketball and went "Rock-a-Bye Baby" over Cooper to close out the regular season and ignite the Philadelphia Spectrum crowd.

<h2>2. Vince Carter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_558340" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-558340" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Vince-Carter-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vince Carter flies through the air for a slam dunk." width="757" height="504" /> Vince Carter flies through the air for a slam dunk | Ronald Martinez[/caption]

In his prime, Carter was the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nbas-deadliest-3-point-shooters-ever.html/">most electric performer</a> in all of sports. With an explosive first step, "Half Man Half Amazing" could drive to the rim at will and finish off plays with floaters, scoop shots, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-when-vince-carter-made-a-mark-on-alonzo-mourning.html/">hammer dunks</a>.

In 2000, Carter shut down the Slam Dunk Contest in Oakland. In taking the event, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-must-retire-jersey.html/">put on a show</a> with a reverse 360 between the legs and windmill slams. For his final dunk, Carter went vertical to jam the ball and his elbow into the basket before he gestured to fellow Carolina alum and former slam dunk contestant Kenny Smith that the competition was already over <span class="s1">--</span> all other contestants should be happy with second place.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_790055" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-790055 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jordan-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan goes for a huge dunk." width="500" height="708" /> Michael Jordan goes for a huge dunk | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In line with the rest of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-nba-players-1990s.html/">his NBA career</a>, Jordan set the gold standard for the aspiring NBA dunker, winning back-to-back slam-dunk competitions in 1987 and 1988. In taking the crown both times, he stared down Wilkins, kissed the rim, cradled the ball, and took off from the foul line.

As an in-game dunker, a young Jordan was known to humiliate the competition off dribble drives, lobs, offensive put-backs, and backdoor cuts. As the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-games-of-michael-jordans-career.html/">most successful pitchman</a> in the history of sports, Air Jordan <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/celebrating-the-7-best-air-jordan-shoes-of-all-time.html/">hawked shoes</a> with the implicit belief that Nike helped him to fly.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Boston Celtics, with their 17 championships, are arguably the most successful franchise in basketball, if not all of sports. Celtics lore is resplendent with flashes of parquet floors, Red Auerbach victory cigars, clutch shooting, raucous home crowds, and a fierce rivalry with their only real NBA competition: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Los Angeles Lakers</a>.

While classic Celtics rosters often lacked raw athleticism, at least compared to some of their contemporaries, they performed as cohesive units greater than the sum of their individual parts through grit, team play, and solid fundamentals. Here are the five best Boston Celtics players to suit up in green.
<h2>1. Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_786599" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-786599 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bill-Russell-Staff-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Boston Celtics of All Time" width="757" height="510" /> Staff/Getty Images[/caption]

At center, Bill Russell anchored a Boston Celtics dynasty that brought home 11 championships over the course of his 13-year career, in no small part because he revolutionized the idea of team defense.

At a wiry 6-foot-10, Russell would often leave his man to hedge out on the perimeter as a help defender before rotating back toward the basket to shut down the interior, and the Celtics great became legendary for his abilities as a shot blocker, mastering the art of keeping the ball inbounds and tapping it over to a waiting teammate.

For rebounds, Russell would play the angles to anticipate shot caroms before boxing out, controlling the basketball, and firing an outlet pass to his point guard to ignite the fast break. In <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html">his career</a>, Russell averaged 15 points, 22.5 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. As a winner, he was the perfect foil for his friend and adversary Wilt Chamberlain, who put up massive numbers but often came up short in the postseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Larry Bird</h2>
[caption id="attachment_786619" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-786619 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry-Bird-Tim-DeFrisco-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Boston Celtics of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s likely that Larry Bird and LeBron James will occupy alternating places at 1A and 1B, depending on how you feel about each, as the two best small forwards in the history of the NBA. While you’d never confuse the Hick from French Lick with an athletic phenomenon like James, Bird more than made up for his relatively slow feet and short vertical leap through sheer grit, solid fundamentals, and unparalleled knowledge of the game.

In half-court sets, Bird would either curl off screens to bury deep jumpers, or wheel and deal in the post for scoop shots at the goal. Bird was one of the better passing forwards of all time, and his playmaking ability alongside his unselfish demeanor saw him in the driver’s seat of some classic NBA teams, including the original Big Three: a front court rounded out by Kevin McHale and Robert Parish.

In the clutch, however, Bird never shied away from taking over the game, as evidenced by a <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/shootout_boston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">classic Game 7 shootout </a>against Dominique Wilkins at Boston Garden, when Larry Legend dropped 20 in the fourth quarter. Bird averaged 24 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 assists per game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the course of 13 years</a> in Boston. During that time, he made five trips to the NBA Finals and won three championships, in 1981, 1984, and 1986.

Bird, of course, will always be linked with Magic Johnson, who he battled against for two decades for hoops supremacy at the collegiate and professional level — there’s an argument to be made that the pair saved the game as they brought its popularity to new heights in the ’80s.

<h2>3. John Havlicek</h2>
[caption id="attachment_786668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-786668 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Havlicek-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Boston Celtics of All Time" width="757" height="535" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Another Celtic who is simply defined as a winner, John Havlicek (far left) bridged the gap in the era between Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Sam Jones to Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, bringing eight championships to Boston between 1963 and 1976. For his part, Hondo still leads the storied <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_career.html">Celtics franchise</a> in points (26,395) and games played (1,270). As a model of consistency, Havlicek averaged 21 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists per game over his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/havlijo01.html">16-year career</a>.

Havlicek’s longevity in Boston was largely due in part to his supreme conditioning. As a defensive force, Hondo would often harass opponents into costly mistakes with steals, deflections, and weak-side blocks. In transition, Havlicek would be out front to fill the wings for easy lay-ups. By the fourth quarter, Hondo had run his man ragged and would be constantly wide open coming off screens for mid-range jump shots out of half-court sets. As a talent, Havlicek was one of the more underrated perimeter players in the history of basketball.

Any discussion on Havlicek, though, has to come back to his defining NBA moment — in the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fTjcJwImw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Havlicek stole the ball</a>. You may have heard about it courtesy of announcer Johnny Most.

<h2>4. Bob Cousy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746728" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746728" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bob-Cousy-Chip-Somodevilla-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Boston Celtics of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images[/caption]

Taken together, Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, and Red Auerbach emerged as the most decorated building blocks of the storied Celtics franchise and dynasty. The Cooz signed on to the Celtics in 1950, after boss Red Auerbach haughtily dismissed the diminutive point guard as a “local yokel” — as a standout college player for Worchester’s College of the Holy Cross, Red didn’t want to be seen as catering to the fledgling Boston fanbase.

Luckily, his concerns were unfounded, as Cousy went on to lead the NBA in assists through eight consecutive seasons (1952-1953 to 1959-1960) and earn the nickname “Houdini of the Hardwood.”

In all, Cousy dropped in 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 8 assists per game in 13 seasons with the Celtics. The Cooz captivated Boston fans with his slick ball handling, no-look passes, and flair for the dramatic. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuR1_rR7mrY">his signature moment</a>, he dribbled out the clock against the Los Angeles Lakers to take his fifth NBA championship (six titles total) in 1963.

<h2>5. Paul Pierce</h2>
[caption id="attachment_786684" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-786684 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pierce-Gabriel-Bouys-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Boston Celtics of All Time" width="757" height="607" /> Gabruek Bouys/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In recent times, Paul Pierce emerged as the savior for a proud Celtics franchise that had slid into irrelevance and mediocrity after the retirement of Larry Bird and tragic deaths of Len Bias and Reggie Lewis. Selected 10th overall in a stacked 1998 NBA Draft that also included Mike Bibby, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, and Dirk Nowitzki, Pierce immediately went to work in restoring Celtic glory.

As a somewhat pudgy 6-foot-7 small forward, Pierce perfected his own inside-out game, in which he could post up, beat defenders off the dribble, or even rain in deep bombs from behind the three-point arc. The Truth was often at his best running isolation plays at the top of the key, where he would bait defenders with a series of hesitation moves before working his way into the lane for floaters, layups, and sharp passes to open teammates. As a testimony to his impact, Pierce is second only to John Havlicek on the Celtics’ all-time scoring list.

In 2007, Danny Ainge negotiated a series of transactions that brought Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to Boston to form a new Big Three. Later that season, Pierce dropped 22 points while also hauling in 5 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists per game en route to claiming Finals MVP honors in victory against the archrival Los Angeles Lakers.

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James has won three NBA championships and faces a fourth opportunity. But we have 10 reasons why his days of winning titles are over.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cleveland fell behind 3-1 in the 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> Finals against the defending champion Golden State Warriors. It seemed like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a>' Finals appearance record would become an unhealthy 2-5. As the King teetered on the brink of joining some <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically unenviable company</a>, something remarkable happened: The Cleveland Cavaliers returned from the dead, winning the whole thing.

The NBA championship resided in the City of Cleveland. As everyone knows, this does not happen without James leading one of the greatest comebacks in the world of sports. Honestly, we never expected to happen -- yet it did. Now the question remains: Can James do it again?

The King finally reunited with his crown, reaffirming his status as the greatest basketball player on the planet. However, some believe he may never reach the pinnacle of the sport again. In fact, we can give you 10 reasons why James will never win another NBA championship.
<h2>10. Eastern Conference is on the rise</h2>
[caption id="attachment_939664" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-939664" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-506966484-Lebron-James-Cleveland-Cavaliers.jpg" alt="LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James doesn't want to hear it. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

For the better part of a decade, the Eastern Conference has been James's personal playground. He's won three NBA titles and made six straight Finals appearances. As evidenced by this year's NBA Playoffs, he consistently steamrolls the competition in the early rounds of the postseason. But that may not be the case for much longer.

The Boston Celtics are strong, and other teams are rebuilding rather quickly. James remains firmly fixed on the throne, but teams in the East finally seem ready to challenge for conference supremacy in the coming seasons.

<h2>9. Winning titles is expensive</h2>
[caption id="attachment_635027" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635027" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwyane-Wade_Miami-Heat-and-LeBron-James_Cleveland-Cavaliers-640x427.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat talks with LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat talks with LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

As Wade co-hosted <em>Live with Kelly,</em> the Chicago Bull fielded a question about the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/16859781/dwyane-wade-says-lebron-james-cheapest-player-nba">cheapest NBA player</a>. Without hesitation, Flash gave a potentially surprising answer: LeBron James. How is this relevant to winning championships? Let us explain.

Although the salary cap keeps rising, James will do whatever it takes to maximize his financial situation. He will get a max contract, which he deserves, and is past the point of taking a pay cut; even if it means creating cap flexibility for another star. It costs a lot of money to build a championship-level team -- we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cleveland-paid-team-eastern-conference.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saw this with the Cavs</a>. Given Wade's comments and James' approach to business, LeBron's championship window may close sooner than expected.

<h2>8. Shot has regressed</h2>
[caption id="attachment_654170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-654170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-534344014.jpg" alt="LeBron James warms up. | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> LeBron James warms up. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

James is a freak specimen unlike the National Basketball Association has ever seen. Because of his athleticism and basketball IQ, the King proves nearly unstoppable when attacking the basket. But as he ages, getting to the basket whenever he wants will become harder. Considering how fickle his jumper has become, this could be a problem.

Teams have started daring James to shoot the rock, and this strategy has worked in their favor. The King shot just 30.9% from three in during the 2015–16 season; he connected on a measly <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">34.8% on attempts</a> ranging from 10–16 feet from the basket. If teams challenge him to beat them from the outside, then he needs a reliable jump shot. Unfortunately, that's not always the case.

<h2>7. Exhaustion of the postseason</h2>
[caption id="attachment_650891" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-650891" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="LeBron James looks on during Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James looks on during Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The fact that James already has a total of 8,383 playoff minutes under his belt is crazy. Yet the amount of miles he's put on his body over the last six seasons is more concerning. Dating back to the 2010–11 season (when his streak of six straight Finals appearances began<span class="s1">), </span>James has led the postseason in total minutes on four occasions. Despite seeming superhuman at times, even a player like LBJ is not immune to wear and tear. Don't be surprised when these minutes finally catch up to the King.

<h2>6. Has achieved the peak of his career goals?</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656997" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656997" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="LeBron James holds the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James holds the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

For the first time in 52 years, the city of Cleveland won a professional sports championship. This was James' goal ever since the Cavaliers selected him first overall in 2003. Not only that, but getting a title in Cleveland was the main reason he <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/11/lebron-james-free-agent-decision-cleveland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">returned home</a> after a four-year hiatus in South Beach. Any way you look at it, and no matter where he goes, this will be the crowning achievement of James's basketball career. Does this change how he approaches the rest of his career? It's certainly possible.

<h2>5. Your deity of choice hates Cleveland</h2>
[caption id="attachment_817948" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-817948 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sad-Cavaliers-Fans-Angelo-Merendino-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, OH- JUNE 16: Cleveland Cavaliers fans react during game 6 of the NBA finals on June 16, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio.

Up until the Cavaliers championship, cynical Cleveland fans took to the terms “God Hates Cleveland” and “We’re Not Detroit” as morbid rallying cries at the Mistake by the Lake. The city of Cleveland had <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-american-cities-with-the-most-miserable-sports-fans.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last won a professional sports championship</a> in 1964, when Otto Graham ran the Wing T formation. In 1969, the city appeared to hit rock bottom as an industrial wasteland; the Cuyahoga River <a href="http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually caught on fire</a> through downtown Cleveland.

In recent years, Cleveland sports have remained inexorably linked to The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, and The Decision. By defeating the Golden State Warriors in 2016 in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest comeback in NBA Finals history</a>, some may be under the impression that "the curse" in Cleveland is officially over. But don't kid yourselves, that's not how curses work. Happiness is nothing more than a fleeting moment. The people in Cleveland would be wise to remember this.

<h2>4. Lack of depth</h2>
[caption id="attachment_811073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-811073 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LeBron-James-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images-e1433879733225.jpg" width="757" height="529" /> It's hard being the King. | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cleveland Cavaliers are plagued by a surprising lack of depth for being championship contenders. Last season, the un-drafted free agent Matthew Dellavedova (now in Milwaukee) filled in as the unlikely hero to back up Irving for timely steals, smart passes, and fearless drives to the hoop.

Still, the scrappy Delly and a second unit featuring the likes of J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert, and Tristan Thompson was of little match for the high-octane Golden State Warriors and their small ball lineups. Although the Cavaliers found redemption that season, much of that should be credited to the calming persona of head coach Tyronn Lue, this group is not known for its formidable bench presence. We don't see that changing any time soon.

<h2> 3. Age</h2>
[caption id="attachment_826286" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-826286 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/LeBron-James-and-Kawhi-Leonard-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images1-e1437253581721.jpg" width="757" height="504" /> LeBron James tries to shoot over Kawhi Leonard. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Even diehard Cleveland fans must recognize recently-retired Kobe Bryant as the ghost of Christmas Future for James. Like Bryant, the James odometer and prep-to-pro track includes a staggering amount of minutes in the form of All-Star exhibitions, deep playoff runs, and Olympic Gold. Bryant is approaching 50,000 regular season minutes, while James is coming off an unprecedented six consecutive trips to the NBA Finals.

Going forward, Cleveland brass will be forced to make the call; to either run James into the ground, like Bryant, or begin restricting his regular-season minutes, like Tim Duncan in San Antonio. James, at 31, is starting to show signs of wear and tear.

With time, James may find himself even less effective at crunch time, unless he puts in the real work to develop a consistent jump shot. To date, James has reverted to pounding the ball in the post and lurching into the paint late in the shot clock. For The King, Bully Ball will prove highly ineffective on the other side of 35.

<h2>2. LeBron as player-coach and pseudo GM</h2>
[caption id="attachment_650542" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-650542" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="LeBron James looks defeated during Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James looks defeated during Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The Blatt firing, along with the lack of depth in Cleveland, may confirm speculation that James is the de facto player-coach and General Manager of the Cavaliers. Last season, James blurted out, “I don’t pay no bills around here,” and then offered up tepid support for Blatt. Although James is not physically writing checks, <a href="http://time.com/2981583/lebron-james-cleveland-cavs-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finance professor LeRoy Brooks</a> estimated $500 million in annual stimulus to the Cleveland economy due to the “LeBron Effect.”

Despite his claims to the contrary, it's clear that The King wields the power to force issues and surround himself with “his guys” in Cleveland. When he left Miami for Cleveland, James effectively swapped out Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh for the fresher legs of Love and Irving. As part of this deal, Cleveland shipped first overall pick Andrew Wiggins to Minnesota in exchange for Love. Interestingly, Cleveland initially brought on Blatt to teach professionalism to a young core of Wiggins and Irving. Instead, they asked him to steer a ship loaded with veterans and built to win now.

James seems to hold Cleveland executives hostage, making the team hire a buddy and “yes man” coach, while keeping owner Dan Gilbert’s checkbook at the ready to sign such trusted, deferential sidekicks. The drive to sign Lebron’s guys, however, creates a logjam of rebounders, shot blockers, and outside shooters who leave Cleveland with little cap space or flexibility to bring in more help.

Interestingly, Cleveland already given on Wiggins. (He could have provided this franchise with youthful energy, pressure defense, and playmaking against top competition.<span class="s1">) </span>Cleveland executives must give James what he needs and not exactly what he wants in order for this team to ever have a real shot at a championship.

<h2>1. Western Conference competition</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663653" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663653" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Curry-and-Durant-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant embrace after the Western Conference Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant embrace after the Western Conference Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

For several years running, James and Company have steamrolled over the weak Eastern Conference before running into a stacked buzzsaw Out West. And while the Cavaliers finished on top in 2016, the quality in the Western Conference continues to remain the biggest impediment to James's future championship aspirations.

Beyond the Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers are waiting in the wings as a potential matchup nightmare for the Cavs in the Finals. In 2014, Kawhi Leonard won Finals MVP honors for his spectacular end-to-end work against James in the Finals. For the series, Leonard stuffed the stat sheet for 18 points, six rebounds, two assists, two steals, and one block per game to establish himself as one of the more complete players in the game.

After a bitter 2015 first-round playoff loss, the Spurs Dynasty went to work signing LaMarcus Aldridge as the grand prize of this latest free agent sweepstakes. Meanwhile, after falling to Cleveland in this year's Finals, the Dubs, in a perfect example of the "rich getting richer," reloaded by convincing Kevin Durant to ditch Oklahoma City <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in favor of the Bay Area</a>. Despite his injury history, Durant will likely be ready for the playoffs.

Most alarmingly for James, however, is the fact that his primary Western Conference rivals are just now entering their respective primes. Kawhi Leonard is a precocious 24, while Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook are all 27 years old. In some circles, Steph Curry, and not James, is already being regarded as the best player in all of basketball. Certainly, James knows that “heavy lies the head that wears the crown.”

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_707901" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707901" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/LeBron-James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="LeBron James is ready for a big year | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> There is no one like LeBron James | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

The summer of 2014 was a busy one for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> Draft class of 2003. Carmelo Anthony decided to stay in New York, LeBron James <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-events-that-made-us-love-lebron-james.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took his talents back to Ohio</a>, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade re-upped with the Miami Heat, and Darko Milicic <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11581331/darko-milicic-quits-hoops-signs-pro-kickboxer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided</a> to take up kickboxing. Yes, this is true: 29-year-old Darko had a new sport to pursue (which is a good thing, considering his lack of success in the previous one).

While the Pistons have to wonder what could have been had they gone in a different direction with the No. 2 overall pick back in ’03, we thought this would be as good a time as any to revisit <span class="s2">--</span> and re-rank <span class="s2">--</span> the top 10 picks of that notable draft. And of course, we begin our countdown with a certain hoopster-turned-kickboxer…

<h2>10. Darko Milicic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702788" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702788" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107623841-640x428.jpg" width="757" height="506" /> Darko Milicic most likely missed this shot attempt | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 2
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Detroit Pistons

While we can’t definitively say that Darko Milicic was the worst basketball player taken in the first 10 picks of the 2003 NBA Draft, he was undoubtedly the biggest flop. Detroit passed on more than one future superstar to take the Serbian teenager who had turned 18 less than a week earlier. Milicic went on to average a whopping <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/milicda01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game</a> during a decade in the league, including appearances with the Pistons, Magic, Grizzlies, Knicks, Timberwolves, and Celtics.

<h2>9. Mike Sweetney</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 9
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: New York Knicks

Mike Sweetney, taken ninth overall by the New York Knicks, lasted just four years in the NBA. He played two seasons each with the Knicks and Bulls, and averaged a modest 6.5 points per game. The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sweetmi01/gamelog/2006/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highlight</a> of his career came in 2005-2006, when he scored at least 20 points in a game four times in the span of a month. Sweetney bounced around teams in Central and South America over the past few years, <a href="http://www.sportando.com/en/world/america/125271/brujos-de-guayama-waive-mike-sweetney-sign-walter-sharpe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but it seems</a> like his playing days may be about over.

<h2>8. Jarvis Hayes</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 10
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Washington Wizards

The No. 10 overall pick out of Georgia, Jarvis Hayes spent seven years in the NBA, the first four of which came with the Washington franchise that drafted him. During his time in the league, Hayes <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hayesja01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">averaged just 8.3 points and 3.1 boards a game</a> and never started more than 42 games in any single season. After stints with the Pistons and Nets, Hayes went overseas to continue his basketball career.

<h2>7. T.J. Ford</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uch7g5l2Ofw"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 8
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Milwaukee Bucks

T.J. Ford overcame persistent back issues to put together a solid if unspectacular NBA career. Ford <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7676569/san-antonio-spurs-tj-ford-retiring-latest-injury-neck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underwent spinal surgery</a> in 2004 after an on-court collision and missed the entire 2004–05 season. He was able to return to the league and played in seven more seasons before <a href="http://blog.mysanantonio.com/spursnation/2012/03/12/backup-guard-ford-decides-to-end-career/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling it quits</a> in March 2012. Ford posted career averages of 11.2 points and 5.8 assists during his time with the Bucks, Raptors, Pacers, and Spurs.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Los Angeles Clippers

Central Michigan's Chris Kaman played the first eight years of his career with the Clippers before making one-year stops with the Mavericks, Hornets, and Lakers before playing the 2014–2015 season -- and part of the 2015–16 campaign -- in Portland. The veteran center has career averages of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kamanch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11.2 points and 7.6 boards a game</a>, including the 2009–2010 season, when he averaged 18.5 points per contest.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Chicago Bulls

After a career that saw him go full circle by playing the beginning portion of the 2015–16 season with the team that drafted him (the Chicago Bulls), Kirk Hinrich finished the year as a member of the Atlanta Hawks. Hinrich has been to the playoffs 11 times in his career, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hinriki01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">averaging 10.5 points per game in the postseason</a> (as compared to 10.9 in the regular season).

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 4
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Toronto Raptors

The top four players in this draft class are all superstars, no matter which order you rank them in. We have Bosh at No. 4 overall, which is exactly where he was taken by Toronto in 2003. Bosh averaged over 20 points a game for the Raptors from 2003–10 before teaming up with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami to form a “super-team” in the summer of 2010. While Bosh struggled at times in South Beach to find his niche as a third option, he has two rings and four straight trips to the Finals to show for his troubles. For his career, Bosh has <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/boshch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scored 19.2 points and grabbed 8.5 rebounds a game</a>.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 3

One of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/carmelo-anthony-highlights-top-3-march-madness-performances.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most prolific scorers of his generation</a>, Syracuse product <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/carmelo-anthony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmelo Anthony</a> has taken the NBA by storm since he joined the league in 2003. Melo has filled the nets to the tune of 24.9 points per game, first with the Nuggets and most recently in basketball’s mecca playing for the New York Knicks (since a 2011 trade). When it’s all said and done, Melo very well may rank even higher among the best players in the 2003 draft class, but he’s still searching for a first elusive championship ring.

<h2>2. Dwyane Wade</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 5
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Miami Heat

Until this offseason,<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dwyane-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dwyane Wade</a> was the only player on this list who’s played all 13 years with the team that originally drafted him. Wade owns three rings as a member of the Miami Heat, one in 2005–2006 and two more in the Big Three era. While his body is showing signs of wear and tear, his career scoring average still sits at a lofty <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23.6 points per game</a> (to go along with 5.7 assists and 4.8 rebounds a night). D-Wade also led the NBA in scoring back in 2008–2009. While he’s not what he once was, Wade still gets credit, especially when the No. 1 player on this list went back to Cleveland. And that, of course, is…

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Original pick</span>: No. 1
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Cleveland Cavaliers

The best player on the planet -- unless you prefer that Warrior who does his thing for Golden State -- changed the course of the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise forever when the team drafted this homegrown superstar in 2003. And since returning to the team in 2014, he’s done the exact same thing. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a> boasts a career stat line of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 7.0 assists</a>, and — perhaps more importantly for King James — three championship rings, including Cleveland's first in over 50 years. It's safe to say that, unlike many of the teams on this list, the Cavs got the No. 1 pick right all those years ago.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_811057" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-811057 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images2-e1433879445856.jpg" alt="LeBron James is focused during Game 2 of 2015 NBA Finals." width="757" height="547" /> LeBron James walks across the court. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

In June 2015, in front of millions of basketball fans, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-nba-teams-have-the-longest-active-playoff-streaks-2.html/">Golden State Warriors</a> dispatched the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games. It’s not that the Cavaliers didn’t have a prayer at the beginning of the series. However, with Kevin Love sidelined and Kyrie Irving going down at the end of Game 1 with what was eventually diagnosed as a fractured kneecap, Cleveland never really stood a chance.

One year later, facing what could only be classified as insurmountable odds, the Cleveland Cavaliers rose from the ashes -- i.e., a 3-1 deficit to a 73-win Warriors squad -- and pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. The main reason the Cavs were able to scrape and claw their way back to the top of the basketball mountain is simple: LeBron James.

The best player on the planet <span class="s1">-- </span>who was playing in his sixth consecutive Finals at the time -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/">took the series by storm</a>. The rest of the Cavs followed James' lead and the defending champion Warriors were defeated in seven games. Now, to the surprise of no one, the King and the Cavs are at it again.

In 2016–17, for the <a href="http://news.cheatsheet.com/sports/2017-nba-finals-why-cavs-warriors-part-3-has-the-makings-of-a-classic.html/">third straight season</a>, the Cavs and Warriors duked out in the NBA Finals. This time, however, James and company were unable to overcome the Western Conference champs. Behind <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-single-game-performances-in-nba-finals-history.html/">sensational performances</a> from Kevin Durant -- who took home Finals MVP honors -- and Stephen Curry, Golden State took home the title in five games. Still, it's hard to argue with LeBron's overall greatness, as the King was making his seventh consecutive trip to the Finals and the eighth of his illustrious career.

While this latest loss brings James' overall Finals record to 3-5, his legacy as one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-all-time-great-nba-basketball-players-by-position.html/">game's all-time greats</a> is firmly cemented. See for yourself, as we rank all the King's NBA Finals performances to date.

<h2>8. 2011 NBA Finals: Miami Heat vs. Dallas Mavericks</h2>

</ul>
James took his talents to South Beach for this very reason: to compete for championships. However, despite reaching the Finals during his first season as a member of the Miami Heat, we’re sure this is one showing he’d like to forget. During the club’s eventual loss to the Dallas Mavericks, the King couldn’t quite put it all together.

LeBron was <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2011_finals_DAL-MIA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third on the team in scoring</a>. He committed 24 total turnovers and only shot 60% from the free-throw line. His Game Score total was a lackluster 13.7 -- showing that his overall productivity throughout the series was a bit over average. It was clear that Miami hadn’t properly discovered how best to use its newly formed Big Three. Perhaps this is when James realized that learning to win was "<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11824862/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-loss-going-long-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a process</a>."

<h2>7. 2007 NBA Finals: Cleveland Cavaliers vs. San Antonio Spurs</h2>

<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Finals Averages</span>: 22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Lost to Spurs in four games</li>
</ul>
James was just 22 years old <span class="s1">-- </span>just his fourth NBA season <span class="s1">-- </span>when he made his first Finals appearance. Neither James nor the Cleveland Cavaliers were ready for the task at hand. Their poor showing would emphatically prove this point.

The San Antonio Spurs took it to the Eastern Conference champion. They <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/series?series=clesas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swept the Cavs</a> in four games, winning the franchise’s fourth title in nine years. The King struggled for much of the series. He shot just 35.6% from the field, 20% from three-point range, and 69% from the line. He carried the scoring load for Cleveland. But James also had the highest turnover percentage on the team (<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2007_finals_CLE-SAS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18.3%</a>).

Many may say this was his poorest showing in the NBA Finals. We, however, can't overlook the circumstances. ‘Bron was young, inexperienced, and surrounded by players like Drew Gooden and Daniel Gibson. This team was fortunate enough simply to make the NBA Finals. You can’t really fault James for not being able to take over the series.

James <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/writer/ken-berger/19399765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally got over the hump</a> in the 2012 NBA Finals, as the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. By averaging 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game, King James was the clear runaway winner for the Finals MVP award.

On top of playing 44 minutes a game, James had a 47.2% field goal percentage and hit 82.6% of his free throws. He led the team in Game Score (23.6), usage percentage (29.7%), and assist percentage (31.0%). In a showdown between two of the game’s best talents, the King showed that Kevin Durant wasn’t quite ready to wear the crown.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Beat the Spurs in seven games</li>
</ul>
With James leading the way, the Heat toppled the San Antonio Spurs in seven games, and the club won its second consecutive NBA championship. The King was at the center of everything for Miami during this series. He led the team in minutes per game (43.0), Game Score (22.5), usage percentage (29.7%), assist percentage (30.1%), and total points (177).

He may have averaged more points a game during the 2012 Finals, but this Spurs team required James to give more of himself than ever before. And for any who maintained that LeBron wasn’t born with “the clutch gene," he gave them this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9C7FUAP9HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big-time shot</a> in Game 7 that all but iced it for Miami. For the record, he also <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201306200MIA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put up 37 points</a> — on 52.2% shooting — 12 rebounds, and 4 assists in that close-out game.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Lost to Spurs in five games</li>
</ul>
There’s no question that James had put up better numbers in previous Finals appearances. On top of that, the Heat were thoroughly throttled in five games by a much superior San Antonio team. If you rewatch this series again, you’ll see that James was pretty much carrying the load all by himself. The King averaged 28.2 points per game, while the closest Heat member to that total was <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwyane Wade</a>, who only contributed 15.2 points a contest. ‘Bron had a terrible turnover percentage — 15.5% — but that’s because he was forced to have the ball in his hands for the majority of the time.

In the end, he still <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2014_finals_MIA-SAS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">led the Heat</a> in minutes played, total points, total rebounds, assists, and steals. James shot 57.1% from the field and connected on 51.9% of his threes. What it boils down to is, Miami was simply no match for its Western Conference foe. Still, that doesn’t mean that James didn’t leave it all on the court. He certainly did, and then some.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Lost to Golden State in six games</li>
</ul>
James wasn’t shooting the ball as well as he has in the past, but every other facet of his 2015 NBA Finals performance is nothing short of unbelievable. As the only top tier player left standing for the Cavs, James showed the will of a champion. He <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/611041689986301952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was the first player ever</a> to lead both teams in points per game (35.8), assists per game (8.8), and rebounds per game (13.3). He had a 27.2 Game Score, a usage percentage of 43.3%, and an assist percentage of 53.1%.

The King put this young Cavaliers team on his back and carried them to a potential Finals upset. Sure, the Warriors came out on top, but LeBron's ability to play at such a high level, and make those less talented players around him that much better, was otherworldly. If he can lead somehow lead Cleveland to a title in 2016, it will easily be his greatest Finals performance ever.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Lost to Golden State in five games</li>
</ul>
Although the Cavaliers were unable to repeat as champions in 2017, it's impossible to hold any of that against the King. Facing a historically great Golden State Warriors team, James was absolutely incredible. He played 42.4 minutes per game, shot 56.4% from the field, and averaged a ridiculous 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, becoming the first player ever to <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/874480642758782976">average a triple-double in the Finals</a>.

The history books will show that James and the Cavs fell to the Warriors in five games. However, make no mistake, had the Dubs not added KD in the offseason, there's a good chance LeBron and company would've come away victorious. That alone should speak volumes about James' performance in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com//playoffs/2017-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html">2017 NBA Finals</a>.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">End Result</span>: Beat Golden State in seven games</li>
</ul>
Two years after returning home, James completed the greatest achievement of his professional basketball career -- bringing a championship to the city of Cleveland. Despite facing incredible odds for most of the series, including deficits of 2-0 and 3-1, the King took matters into his own hands, leading the Cavaliers to the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history.

In a showdown that reaffirmed his status as the best player on the planet, while cementing his status as one of the all-time greats, 'Bron averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 8.9 assists per game, including <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-scored-40-back-nba-finals-games.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back-to-back 41-point performances</a> in Games 5 and 6 of these <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 Finals</a>. Now that the King is back on his throne, it's time for the doubters to finally give it a rest and admit the simple truth: They have "Witnessed" greatness.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_934312" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-934312" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/LeBron-James-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers warms up prior to facing the Denver Nuggets." width="757" height="505" /> As one of the highest-paid NBA players, LeBron James is all smiles. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Whether it’s from a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-biggest-contracts-in-nba-history.html/">hefty salary</a> or an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-earning-money-endorsements.html/">abundance of endorsements</a>, the highest-paid NBA players are pulling in some serious bank. That much we all know. However, what you might not know are the specifics. Fortunately, that’s about to change. Thanks to Forbes’s Kurt Badenhausen, we now know all about the league’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2017/02/15/lebron-durant-and-curry-head-the-nbas-highest-paid-players-2017/#4f69a3324b72" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid players</a>. And to be honest, even we were a bit taken aback by the information:
<blockquote>Forbes' earnings figures include salaries for the 2016–17 season and estimates on off-court income between June 2016 and June 2017. Off-court income includes endorsements, licensing, royalties, appearances and media deals. The top 10 players will earn $449 million this season, up 15% compared to the 10 top-earners last year. Their cumulative paychecks are split almost evenly between salaries and endorsements.</blockquote>
Of course, as it is in all pro sports, some individuals find themselves earning a fair amount more than others. In the case of the NBA, here’s a look at the 10 players who will get paid the most in 2017.

<h2>10. Kyrie Irving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_724776" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-724776" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Kyrie-Irving-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kyrie Irving gets back on defense." width="757" height="505" /> Kyrie Irving has serious game. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $30.6 million

Thanks a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-the-5-most-elite-ball-handlers-in-the-league.html/">sweet handle</a> and an undeniable clutch gene, Kyrie Irving has established himself as one of the game's premier point guards. As a result, he's been able to capitalize both on and off the court. Aside from the $17.6 million the Cavs are paying him this season, the former Dukie is taking in a cool $13 million in endorsement money. With $30.6 million in total earnings, Uncle Drew holds steady at No. 10 on the NBA's highest-paid players list.

<h2>9. Chris Paul</h2>
[caption id="attachment_727641" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-727641" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chris-Paul-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chris Paul tries to keep the situation under control." width="757" height="554" /> Chris Paul remains the key to the Los Angeles Clippers' success. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $30.9 million

Chris Paul is one of the best floor generals money can buy. The Clippers know this, which is why they're paying him $22.9 million this season. However, they're not the only ones, as CP3 is pulling in another $8 million courtesy of endorsement deals with companies like Spalding, State Farm, Fan Duel, and Nike's Jordan Brand. Although Paul is probably not used to coming in ninth place in anything, making <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/9-chris-paul/#270ea5f1633a">$30.9 million</a> is nothing to be embarrassed.

<h2>8. Carmelo Anthony</h2>
[caption id="attachment_764443" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-764443" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Carmelo-Anthony-Elsa-Getty-Images-598x500.jpg" alt="Carmelo Anthony reacts to knocking down a shot." width="757" height="633" /> Carmelo Anthony has a knack for scoring. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $32.6 million

Carmelo Anthony may go his whole career without ever winning a title, but as one of basketball's most gifted scorers, he still pulls in top dollar. This year, thanks to sweet deals with companies like Nike's Jordan Brand, Anthony is raking in $8 million in endorsement money. Add that to the $24.6 million the Knicks pay him in salary, and Melo is sitting pretty with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/8-carmelo-anthony/#3a18f508403d">$32.6 million in total earnings</a>.

<h2>7. Derrick Rose</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751361" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751361" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-630517666-640x427.jpg" alt="Derrick Rose of the New York Knicks dribbles the ball against the Boston Celtics." width="757" height="505" /> Derrick Rose looks to make a play. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $35.3 million

We’ll always be left wondering how good Derrick Rose could have been had he not suffered a string of unfortunate injuries. And yet, while the New York Knicks point guard’s standing among the game’s elite took a hit, the former MVP’s bank account has not. Rose is making <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/new-york-knicks/derrick-rose-6095/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$21.3 million in salary this year</a> and raking in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/7-derrick-rose/#5894bd0833b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$14 million in endorsement money</a>, making him the seventh highest-paid NBA player in 2017.

<h2>6. Dwyane Wade</h2>
[caption id="attachment_720115" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-720115" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dwyane-Wade-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade reacts to hitting a three." width="757" height="504" /> Dwyane Wade is drilling threes in Chicago. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $36.2 million

Although Dwyane Wade left Miami for the Windy City, the move certainly hasn't hurt his bank account. This season, the Bulls are paying him a salary of $23.2 million. Couple that with the $13 million he's earning through endorsements <span class="s1">-- </span>making his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/6-dwyane-wade/#1d3301266b4d">total earnings for the season $36.2 million</a> <span class="s1">--</span> and it's clear Flash is still sitting pretty.

<h2>5. Russell Westbrook</h2>
[caption id="attachment_678238" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-678238" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Russell-Westbrook-2-640x427.jpg" alt="Russell Westbrook brings the ball up the court." width="757" height="505" /> Russell Westbrook works hard for his money. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $41.5 million

Ever since KD's departure this past summer, Russell Westbrook has been nothing short of a one-man wrecking crew. The Brodie has the Thunder in playoff contention, while <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/can-russell-westbrook-average-triple-double-season.html/">averaging a triple-double</a> for the season and doing whatever it takes to earn his money. And it's a lot of money -- $41.5 million in total earnings to be exact. When it comes to Westbrook, it's best to just sit back and enjoy the show.

<h2>4. James Harden</h2>
[caption id="attachment_934276" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-934276" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/James-Harden-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="James Harden reacts to a made basket against the Pacers." width="757" height="489" /> James Harden reacts to the play. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $46.5 million

Not only is Houston Rockets superstar James Harden getting paid -- $26.5 million in salary -- for dropping buckets and dimes, he’s reaping plenty of rewards off the hardwood as well. Thanks to his dealings with companies like NBA 2K, Stance, New Era, and of course, Adidas (hello, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-your-cheat-sheet-to-adidas-200m-bid-for-james-harden.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 million deal</a>), Harden has increased his off-court earnings to $20 million. This makes one thing abundantly clear: At <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/4-james-harden/#18561285252b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$46.5 million in total earnings</a>, The Beard gets paid.

<h2>3. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746202" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746202" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Stephen-Curry-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry warms up prior to a game against the Cavs." width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Curry is money. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $47.1 million

By superstar standards, Stephen Curry's 2016–17 salary of $12.1 million is actually insulting. But don't worry, the Baby-Faced Assassin is more than making up for it in endorsement money. Thanks to deals with everyone from Chase to Under Armour, the two-time MVP is set to pull in $35 million in off-court earnings, giving him <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/3-stephen-curry/#124a5ba8490f">$47.1 million in total earnings</a> this year.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kevin Durant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746217" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746217" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kevin-Durant-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant reacts during a game against the Cavs." width="757" height="505" /> It's good to be Kevin Durant. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $62.5 million

With <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/2-kevin-durant/#43b3a4e13e40" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total earnings of $62.5 million</a>, Kevin Durant comes in at No. 2 on the list of the NBA’s highest-paid players in 2016. And if you think that’s impressive, just wait until you see how it’s all broken down. Aside from his $26.5 million salary with the Golden State Warriors, KD’s partnership with the app Acorns, as well as deals with companies like Sparkling Ice, BBVA, Beats, and Nike (<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11443079/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-stays-nike-shoe-company-matches-armour-offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worth upwards of $300 million</a>), has helped him pull in $36 million in endorsement money alone. Clearly Durant’s shot isn’t the only thing unstoppable about him.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_767031" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-767031" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/LeBron-James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LeBron James warms up before a game." width="757" height="504" /> It's all about LeBron. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $86 million

Long live the King.

If you think LeBron James’s $31 million salary -- the highest in the NBA this season -- is massive, just wait until you hear about his off-the-court ventures. That’s where his royalty really shines. The Cleveland Cavaliers superstar works with everyone from Intel to Verizon, has a production company (SpringHill Entertainment), a multi-platform media company (Uninterrupted), dealings with Fenway Sports Management, and a major investment in the assembly-line pizza franchise, Blaze. And of course, we can’t forget about his new “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-rumors-details-of-lebrons-lifetime-deal-with-nike.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifetime</a>" deal with Nike -- something that no one else in history has ever had. All in all, James will see $55 million in endorsements, taking his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fhhdd/1-lebron-james/#5286c9155d5e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">total 2017 earnings to $86 million</a>. This proves once again -- to anyone who didn’t already know it -- that it’s good to be the King.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_928337" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Golden-State-Warriors-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-928337" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Golden-State-Warriors-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Golden State Warriors get their championship rings" width="757" height="505" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

As great as the Golden State Warriors were in 2015, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-how-the-warriors-will-break-the-bulls-72-win-record.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last season's group was beyond special</a>, as they finished the regular season with a now-record 73 wins. Unfortunately, despite holding a 3-1 lead in the 2016 NBA Finals, the Dubs decided to "poke the bear," ultimately turning <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a> into the Terminator, hell-bent on pulling off the impossible -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which he did</a> by helping the Cavs become the first team in history to overcome this kind of deficit in the Finals. This just goes to show that in the National Basketball Association, it's now how you start, it's how you finish.

Despite faltering in this year's NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors are an organization with a rich history of excellence, and a laundry list of talented players who have contributed to the success of this franchise over the years. Of course, in reality, some players have had a greater influence than others. In our opinion, here's a look at the six greatest Golden State Warriors in history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Tim Hardaway</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1oBnxQUgVKc"></iframe>

With a sweet handle and killer crossover, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardati01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim Hardaway</a> was the kind of point guard who could penetrate the defense and get to the basket at will. And while that sort of skill allowed him to average <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardati01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19.8 points per game</a> during his six seasons with the Warriors, the “T" in the famous “<a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/history/run_tmc_hardwood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Run TMC</a>" was also all for getting his teammates involved, as he dished out 9.3 assists a night during his time in Golden State. Given his exciting repertoire, we’d be foolish to leave Tim Bug off the list.

<h2>5. Mitch Richmond</h2>
[caption id="attachment_928324" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mitch-Richmond-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-928324" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mitch-Richmond-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt=" Jim Rogash/Getty Images Mitch Richmond speaks during the 2014 Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony at Symphony Hall" width="757" height="532" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

The Golden State Warriors drafted <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/richmmi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitch Richmond</a> out of Kansas State with the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fifth overall pick in the 1998 draft</a>. And for the three seasons he was in the Bay Area (1988-89 to 1990-91) the “M" in “Run TMC" proved to be well worth the pick, averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/richmmi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22.7 points per game</a> on 48.6% shooting. For good measure, the sensational shooting guard and Hall of Famer also knocked down 35.7% of his threes, went 84.0% from the charity stripe, and pulled down 5.5 rebounds a night for the Warriors. Do these numbers make him worthy of No. 5 on our list? You better believe it.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Chris Mullin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_928326" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Chris-Mullin-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-928326" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Chris-Mullin-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chris Mullin speaks during the Basketball Hall of Fame Enshrinement Ceremony at Symphony Hall on August 12, 2011" width="757" height="588" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

You can’t talk about “Run TMC" and not include the “C." And lucky for us, Hall of Famer <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mullich01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Mullin</a>, who the Warriors selected No. 7 overall in 1985, played his way onto this list as well. During his 13 seasons with the club, the sweet-shooting lefty put up 20.1 points per game, shot 51.3% from the field, and connected on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mullich01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36.6% of his shots from beyond the arc</a>. With a stroke like that, Mully was definitely a player you didn’t want to leave open.

<h2>3. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_884919" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stephen-Curry-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-884919" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Stephen-Curry-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry handles the ball against the Pelicans" width="757" height="504" /></a> Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

We have a feeling that by the time <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a> decides to call it a career, he’ll be higher up on the list of historically great Golden State Warriors. However, while the Chef is still cooking, we think putting him at No. 3 is more than fair. Curry is doing things we’ve never seen before. His handle is incredible, his vision is sensational, and his IQ is off the charts. And don’t even get us started on his shooting. Curry has unlimited range and can create his own shot off the dribble. Looking <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this season alone</a>, Curry has followed up his remarkable 2014-15 MVP season by averaging 30.1 points per game, shooting 50.7% from the field, and knocking down 45.4% of his threes. That’s a bad man, right there.

<h2>2. Rick Barry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_928330" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rick-Barry-Steve-Jennings-Getty-Images-for-Samsung.jpg"><img class="wp-image-928330" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rick-Barry-Steve-Jennings-Getty-Images-for-Samsung.jpg" alt="NBA legend Rick Barry speaks on the Samsung LED Court at NBA Opening Night 2015 at Pier 43" width="757" height="598" /></a> Steve Jennings/Getty Images for Samsung[/caption]

The legend of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barryri01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Barry</a> goes well beyond his near-perfect <a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/08/28/rick-barry-is-perplexed-why-players-dont-shoot-free-throws-underhanded-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use of the underhand free throw</a>. During his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barryri01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight seasons with the team</a> (first as the San Francisco Warriors and then the Golden State Warriors), Barry averaged 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. He shot 44.9% from the field and, of course, knocked down 89.6% of his free throws. Until young Steph can call himself a Hall of Famer, like the man pictured above, Rick Barry has to be No. 2.

<h2>1. Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
[caption id="attachment_928335" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wilt-Chamberlain-Brian-Bahr-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-928335" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wilt-Chamberlain-Brian-Bahr-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Wilt Chamberlain talks to the media" width="757" height="511" /></a> Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

The No. 1 spot belongs to <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilt Chamberlain</a>. It couldn’t have gone any other way. The Big Dipper spent six seasons with the organization and he dominated each and every one of them. Chamberlain averaged 31.6 points per game, shot 50.6% from the field, and pulled down a ridiculous <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19.2 rebounds per contest</a>. At first glance, it may seem like these numbers came straight out of a video game. But we assure you, they are very real. Which is why Wilt the Stilt stands alone at the top of the Warriors mountain.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_789222" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789222 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Michael-Jordan-Kobe-Bryant-Vince-Bucci-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="558" /> Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s beyond cliche to say it now, but Michael Jordan in his prime was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-top-nba-players-ever-rank.html/?c" target="_blank">without equal</a> -- even as a young player he torched defenses to the tune of 37 points per game by his third season in the NBA. What’s not so remembered now that the dust has been settled for so long is how critics often ripped His Airness as a selfish gunner who failed to understand the concepts of team basketball.

Early in his career, Jordan was routinely bounced out of the playoffs by the likes of the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons despite racking up massive individual statistics in each series, and because he was ringless he was a prime target for derision. In fact, Jordan did not actually win his first championship until age 28, after he “learned to play the game the right way," if you put any stock into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDpM8476YsA" target="_blank">what Joe Dumars has to say</a>, and put trust into his teammates.

Ultimately, Jordan brought six championships to Chicago as an all-around player, leader, and ultimate gamer who struck the right balance between sharing the ball and taking over in the clutch. There’s no doubt that MJ turned back all challengers — why else would he be considered one of, if not <em>the</em> greatest, of all time? While his competitive streak is legendary (and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/michael-jordan-really-cut-high-school-team-215707476.html" target="_blank">factually if not emotionally embellished</a>) there’s little doubt that Jordan’s five fiercest rival helped to drive his insatiable will to not only win, but to dominate.

<h2>5. Clyde Drexler</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789240" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789240" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Drexler-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="1137" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1983, the Portland Trail Blazers drafted Clyde “The Glide” Drexler with the 14th overall pick, a move that set the stage for one of the most infamous drafts in history. A year later, in 1984, the Houston Rockets drafted hometown hero Hakeem Olajuwon (a former teammate of Drexler at the University of Houston) with the first overall pick.

With the following pick, the Trail Blazers took big man Sam Bowie — the Portland front office reasoned that the team was set for years at shooting guard because they had Clyde the Glide. With the third overall pick, the Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan, a move that tortured Portland fans for years, as Sam Bowie developed into nothing but an outright bust and was dealt to New Jersey after four injury-riddled seasons.

As rivals, Jordan and Drexler locked horns in the 1992 NBA Finals. MJ dominated Drexler on his way to claiming his second championship, averaging 36 points, 5 rebounds, and 7 assists per contest while also holding the Glide to 40% shooting from the field through the six game series. As a shooter, Jordan showcased an added dimension to his game, blitzing Portland for six three pointers before halftime in Game One. The shooting barrage appeared to surprise Michael himself, as the display led to yet another Gatorade “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRe-JyhBtsg">Like Mike</a>” moment.

<h2>4. Gary Payton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789265" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789265 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jordan-Payton-Vincent-LaForetAFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="562" /> Vincent Laforet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Gary Payton was the greatest defensive point guard of all time. Out on the West Coast, Payton earned his nickname, The Glove, for his lockdown defense, racking up 2,445 steals over the course of 17 seasons, which is still good for fourth of all time (Jordan is third in steals, with 2,514).

Beyond the stats, Payton may have been most notable for his brash confidence and non-stop trash talk. In 1996, The Glove took home Defensive Player of the Year honors by swiping nearly 3 steals per game, and leading the Seattle Supersonics to a 64-18 record. That postseason, Payton dropped in 20 points, dished out 7 assists, and hauled in 5 rebounds per game on the way to an NBA Finals showdown with the 72-10 Bulls, who had just compiled the greatest regular season record in league history and had only lost one playoff game blazing their way through the East.

Still, a young GP refused to back down from Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. In Game 2 of the Finals, Vincent Askew stripped Jordan at the top of the key. Payton then outhustled MJ to the loose ball, before turning up court, throwing down a dunk, and wolfing back to Jordan and the silenced Chicago crowd. After that, Sonics head coach George Karl ultimately made the decision to switch Payton onto Jordan for games 4, 5, and 6.

With Payton unleashed, Jordan was held to relatively subpar 23-, 26-, and 22-point scoring totals through the final three games of the series. Seattle fanatics have even gone so far as to suggest that the Sonics would have won the championship had Payton matched up against Jordan from Game 1.

<h2>3. Charles Barkley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715033" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715033" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52027858-e1414005526892.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="506" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

When he was a member of the Philadelphia 76ers, Charles Barkley couldn’t get the best of MJ — the Bulls knocked Philly out of the playoffs in two consecutive seasons, and while Barkley helped the Sixers make six trips to the playoffs in eight years, they could never get it together. Ultimately, the Round Mound of Rebound was sent out West: traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for the rights to Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang, and Tim Perry prior to the 1992-1993 regular season.

That year, a rejuvenated Barkley tore through the league for 26 points, 12 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, and claimed MVP honors on his way to a showdown with the Chicago Bulls. Friends off the court, the two could not have been more different in the public eye, with Chuck going out of his way to declare that he was not a role model in a series of Nike commercials, while Jordan carefully guarded his squeaky clean image and refused to comment upon the controversial issues of his time so as not to risk offending any of his adoring fans.

When the two finally met in the ’93 Finals, Jordan, famously miffed at Barkley’s MVP title, proceeded to dominate Sir Charles for 41 points, 9 rebounds, and 6 assists per game. Needless to say, the Suns lost.

<h2>2. John Starks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789275" align="aligncenter" width="682"]<img class="wp-image-789275 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Michael-Jordan-John-Starks-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="1024" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

The ultimate scrapper, it’s easy to paint John Starks as the antithesis to Jordan’s blue blood basketball pedigree. Starks actually played ball for four separate programs in Oklahoma, prior to going undrafted. As a rookie free agent, John Starks signed on with the Golden State Warriors, but was immediately cut after the 1989 season. From there, he bagged groceries amid short stints through the WBL and CBA circuit.

In 1990, John Starks finally made the team for the New York Knicks, after sustaining a knee injury that prohibited his release from camp. In New York, Starks provided hard-nosed defense and instant offense off the bench. For his efforts, Starks was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1993, before claiming Sixth Man of the Year honors, in 1997. As a Knick, Starks <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/starkjo01.html" target="_blank">went on to average</a> a solid 14 points, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds per game over the course of 8 seasons.

Starks, alongside Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason, and Xavier McDaniel, thrived within grind-it-out half court sets and the physical schemes of head coach Pat Riley. John Starks was especially cantankerous toward both Reggie Miller and Jordan, in brazen fits of trash talk, rough play, technical fouls, fist fights, and ultimately, ejections.

The Knicks were dismissed by Jordan and the Bulls in the NBA Playoffs in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996, but Starks will always be revered for feinting toward a Patrick Ewing screen before spinning and driving baseline against BJ Armstrong. From there, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCTfxOrX4k8" target="_blank">he elevated to throw down a dunk over the top</a> of Horace Grant and a rotating Michael Jordan at the front of the rim.

<h2>1. Isiah Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746732" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746732" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Isiah-Michael-E.-Samojeden-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="493" /> Michael E. Samojeden/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Hailing from the West Side of Chicago, it’s possible that Isiah Thomas took exception to the idea of Jordan supplanting him as the most popular athlete in his Windy City hometown. As a young star in his own right, Zeke was schooled by the likes of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson in going down in the Eastern Conference playoffs and NBA Finals. Thomas did not break through until 1989, when, at 28, he won the first of his two back-to-back titles against the Lakers and Trail Blazers. Sound familiar?

Thomas appeared to take special delight in throttling the Bulls. A baby-faced assassin, Thomas was the ringleader of the Bad Boy Pistons who turned back the Baby Bulls in the 1988, 1989, and 1990 playoffs. The so-called “Jordan Rules" saw Dumars and Thomas funnel Michael into the paint, where bigs like Rick Mahorn, Bill Laimbeer, and Dennis Rodman lay in wait to intimidate and slam the more athletic player into the basket support. In the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals, the Bad Boy Pistons humiliated the Bulls 93-74 in Game 7.

The following year, the Bulls dedicated their season to beating Detroit – and the two teams were to meet again in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals. By this time around, however, the battle-tested Bulls had secured home-court advantage, while MJ had also emerged as a willing passer. For the series, Michael dished out 7 assists to complement his 30 points per game. The Bulls went on to sweep the Bad Boy Pistons en route to winning it all. In response, Thomas led his team off the Detroit floor, and refused to shake hands with his arch nemesis. The following year, Jordan stood in the way of Thomas joining the 1992 Olympic Dream Team.

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA has seen its fair share of great three-point shooters. Here's a look at the 12 players with the most career buckets from beyond the arc.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_520137" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-520137 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Steph-Curry-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry shoots a three-pointer." width="757" height="504" /> Stephen Curry shoots a three-pointer. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

As the game of basketball has evolved (by pushing a player's comfort level further and further beyond the arc), three-point specialists have become among the most feared players on the court because of their ability to quickly turn the tides in a close game or push one out of reach for good. But in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a>, thanks to a certain inexplainable accuracy, some individuals <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/">strike fear into opposing players</a> -- and those players' fans -- on a much more regular basis than others.

In the past several seasons, that player is the Golden State Warriors' <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/stephen-curry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a>. Thanks to his combination of off-balance shots, deep threes, stunning fade-aways, and jumpers from just inside half court, the reigning two-time league MVP has managed to rewrite the definition of what it means to have "unlimited range." In fact, he's been so lethal from long range that, in 2015<span class="s1">–</span>16, not only did he <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15200619/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-nails-400th-3-pointer-cap-season-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set the single-season mark</a> for most three-pointers made with 402, but he also became the first player in NBA history to make at least 300 threes in one year. Yeah, we'd <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-players-in-every-franchises-history.html/">say that's pretty good</a>.

Of course, while there's no denying that Curry is the best three-point shooter in the game today, he has a long way to go before he hits the career marks set by some of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-three-point-shooters-in-nba-history.html/">other great long-range specialists</a> of NBA seasons past. So, who holds the record for the most all-time three-pointers made in a career? Why don't we start with the top 12 players.

<h2>12. Kobe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584828" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584828" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kobe-Bryant-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x455.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant brings up the rock." width="757" height="538" /> Kobe Bryant can score from anywhere. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 1,827

As one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-nba-players-who-are-scoring-maniacs.html/">greatest scorers</a> the game has ever seen, Kobe Bryant could beat you <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-greatest-scoring-games-by-a-single-player-in-nba-history.html/">in a plethora of ways</a>. And knocking down the triple was definitely part of his arsenal. For his career, the Mamba shot 32.9% from beyond the three-point arc and connected on 1,827 three balls; the latter good enough for 12th on the all-time list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>11. Chauncey Billups</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766190" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-766190" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chauncey-Billups-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chauncey Billups smiles before he shoots a free throw." width="757" height="512" /> Chauncey Billups hit a lot of big threes throughout his career. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 1,830

Taken out of Colorado with the No. 3 overall pick in the 1997 draft, Chauncey Billups evolved into the kind of floor general most teams crave. He averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/billuch01.html">15.2 points and 5.4 assists</a> per season, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nba-all-star-selections-of-all-time.html/">made five All-Star teams</a>, earned two All-Defensive Team honors, and was a three-time All-NBA selection.

Fans dubbed him "Mr. Big Shot" for his uncanny ability to, well, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-buzzer-beaters-nba-history.html/">knock down big shots</a>. Obviously. As it were, many of those buckets just so happened to be from beyond the three-point arc -- 1,830 for his career, to be exact. For now, that's good enough for 10th place on the all-time list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_749087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749087" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Stephen-Curry-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors reacts to a second half play." width="757" height="521" /> Stephen Curry is lethal from behind the arc. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 1,839 (and counting)

It’s pretty much game over for the opposition when the Baby-Faced Assassin is feeling it. And while Curry has been in a bit of a slump recently, that hasn't stopped him shooting his way past the Mamba and Billups, placing him in <a href="http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/03/05/stephen-curry-nba-all-time-3-pointers-list-10th-chauncey-billups-warriors-knicks-pistons-video/">sole possession of the No. 10 spot</a> on the all-time three-point makes list. Slowly but surely, Curry continues to state his case as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-players-every-franchises-history.html/">greatest shooter</a> to ever step on a basketball court. At this rate, it's only a matter of time before he reaches the top of this particular mountain.

<h2>9. Joe Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_547028" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-547028" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Joe-Johnson-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-e1436482358995.jpg" alt="Joe Johnson looks upset as he walks across the court." width="757" height="549" /> Joe Johnson knows how to shoot the rock. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 1,903

More often than not, Joe Johnson's claim to fame stems from the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/20-highest-paid-nba-players-time.html/">astronomically large contract</a> he signed with the Atlanta Hawks back in 2010. But make no mistake, during his prime, the seven-time All-Star was among the game's premier shooters. Johnson shot 44.2% from the field throughout his career, while <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsjo02.html">connecting on another 37.3%</a> of his three-point attempts. When he finally decided to walk away from the game in 2016–17, Joe Cool had amassed 1,902 three-point makes, good for ninth place on the all-time list.

<h2>8. Jason Kidd</h2>
[caption id="attachment_554191" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-554191" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jason-Kidd-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-e1439312343284.jpg" alt="A sweaty Jason Kidd looks up at the basket." width="757" height="529" /> Jason Kidd is ready for the moment. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 1,988

Jason Kidd was picked second overall in the 1994 NBA Draft and quickly established himself as one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-8-greatest-nba-passers-of-all-time.html/">most gifted point guards</a> in the league. A regular triple-double threat with career averages of 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, and 6.3 rebounds per game, Kidd had a successful stints in Phoenix, New Jersey, and Dallas (the latter where he won the championship in 2011).

He's now the head coach for the Milwaukee Bucks after retiring in 2013. Although Kidd was not a significant three-point threat at the start of his career, his three-point percentage shows a consistent upwards trend throughout his career and his total of 1,988 is good for No. 8 on the all-time list.

<h2>7. Vince Carter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_520291" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-520291 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Carter-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vince Carter signals to his teammate." width="757" height="502" /> Vince Carter can do it all. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,019 (and counting)

Half-Man, Half-Amazing is seventh on the all-time deep ball shooters list as the rarest of NBA commodities -- a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dunks-in-the-history-of-the-nba-slam-dunk-contest.html/">bonafide superstar</a> who successfully reinvented himself as a net-positive role player as his athleticism started to wane. This is more impressive than it sounds, because Vince Carter's prime was all about athleticism. That's why his biggest moments <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-dunkers-in-nba-history.html/">are all highlight reel dunks</a>, and why, despite limited success in the playoffs and none to speak of as a team's best player, we still think he should <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/vince-carter-should-style-points-get-him-to-the-hoops-hall-of-fame.html/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make it to the Hall of Fame</a>.

Since being drafted in 1998, Carter was the face of two franchises (Toronto and New Jersey) and managed to make an impact in Dallas, Phoenix, Orlando, and Memphis, where he is currently coming off the bench and providing the team with some much-needed wing depth.

<h2>6. Jamal Crawford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_511249" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-511249" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jamal-Crawford-640x460.jpg" alt="Jamal Crawford puts up a shot." width="757" height="544" /> Jamal Crawford has range. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,021 (and counting)

Not only does Jamal Crawford <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-the-5-most-elite-ball-handlers-in-the-league.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contend for the title of best handles</a> in the NBA, but the perennial Sixth Man of the Year contender (and 2015–16 winner) also parlayed his considerable skills into a 16-season career -- 2016–17 marks his 17th season in the NBA -- in the world's best basketball league. He's done this largely by making (and taking) shots that have absolutely no business going into the basket. Crawford is also the NBA's leader in four-point plays (when a three is shot, the shooter is fouled, and the original shot still goes through the hoop).

Holding down the reserve guard spot for the Los Angeles Clippers since 2012, Jamal has also <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-never-should-have-traded.html/">played for the Chicago Bulls</a>, New York Knicks, Atlanta Hawks, Portland Trail Blazers, and Golden State Warriors. Until joining up with Chris Paul and company, Crawford was something of a regular-season wonder; he didn't get any playing time in the playoffs until 2009, despite being drafted nearly a decade earlier.

<h2>5. Kyle Korver</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,026 (and counting)

Although Kyle Korver hasn't knocked down 200-plus threes in a single season since 2014–15, that doesn't make him any less lethal from beyond the arc. In the 2015–16 season, the former Creighton standout drilled 158 threes. So far in 2016–17, he's connected on 131 triples as a member of both the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers. In fact, now that he has the luxury of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/25-players-assists-nba-history.html/">receiving passes from King James</a>, Korver became just the seventh player in NBA history to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2017/02/kyle_korver_makes_his_2000th_3.html">make over 2,000 threes</a> for his career. Not bad for a former second-round pick.

<h2>4. Paul Pierce</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526921" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526921 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pierce-Gabriel-Bouys-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Paul Pierce screams as he wins the finals." width="757" height="607" /> Paul Pierce celebrates winning an NBA title. | Gabruek Bouys/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,138 (and counting)

Paul Pierce, nicknamed “The Truth,” was drafted 10th overall in the 1998 NBA Draft <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-boston-celtics-in-nba-history.html/">by the Boston Celtics</a> and stayed with the team for 15 years before being traded to the Brooklyn Nets prior to the 2013–2014 season. Despite Pierce lacking the same kind of physical prowess wielded by many NBA stars, the small forward has earned himself a future spot in the Hall of Fame through a mix of clever footwork and a shot that was once as feared as any in the league. With over 2,000 three-pointers made in his career, Pierce has earned his reputation as one of the most feared three-point shooters in the league.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Jason Terry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_511248" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-511248" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jason-Terry-Dallas-Mavericks-e1423145093544.jpg" alt="Jason Terry celebrates winning a major game." width="757" height="504" /> Jason Terry with the dagger. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,220 (and counting)

The Atlanta Hawks chose Jason Terry with the 10th overall selection in the 1999 NBA Draft. He quickly established himself as the best player on the team in the 2000–01 season, when he averaged 19.7 points and led the team in steals, assists, and made free throws. When Terry was traded to the Dallas Mavericks just before the 2004–05 season, he established himself as one of most dangerous sixth-man candidates in the league, showing no fear of taking the big shots <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-underdog-won-nba-championship.html/">when the game was on the line</a>.

Currently a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-who-could-retire-after-this-season.html/">member of the Milwaukee Bucks</a>, Terry has <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/terryja01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made 2,217 three-pointers in his career</a>, good for No. 3 on the all-time list. Although Terry doesn’t crack the top 100 when it comes to most three-pointers made in a single season, he shows remarkable consistency, starting with the 2001–02 season when he made 172 threes in the season. After that, Terry pops up again with 171, 167, 162, and 160 three-pointers made during single campaigns throughout his career.

<h2>2. Reggie Miller</h2>
[caption id="attachment_520312" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-520312" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reggie-Miller-Jeff-Kowalsky-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Reggie Miller gets the crowd pumped up." width="757" height="454" /> Reggie Miller reacts to the play. | Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,560

When it comes to three-pointers, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/">Reggie Miller</a> is always among the two or three names that inevitably come up. Chosen with the 11th overall pick in the 1987 NBA Draft by the Indiana Pacers, Miller quickly became a household name with his unbelievable shooting skills and ability to perform in high-pressure environments <span class="s1">-- </span>especially against the New York Knicks, who became the Pacers' bitter rival.

With 2,560 three-pointers made, the gap between Miller and Terry is more than 300 three-pointers wide. A quick glance at the list of most three-pointers in a single season shows Miller’s name come up a whopping nine times, including the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millere01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career-best 229 he made in the 1996–97 season</a> (good enough to tie him for No. 15 on the single-season list). No wonder Spike Lee constantly jabbed at him.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Ray Allen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_534159" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-534159 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ray-allen_denzel-washington-e1431110112558.jpg" alt="Denzel Washington congratulates Ray Allen on a win." width="757" height="505" /> Denzel Washington (L) and Ray Allen | Noel Vasquez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point makes</span>: 2,973

The undisputed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-memorable-shots-ray-allens-nba-career.html/">king of the three-point field goal</a>, Ray Allen had a nearly unparalleled shooting prowess, even as he finished his career with the Miami Heat. Chosen with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves from a star-studded 1996 NBA Draft before being immediately traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, Allen quickly established himself as one of the finest shooters the games has ever seen.

On the all-time list of three-pointers made in a single season, Allen comes up 11 times, including <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_season.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two times in the top 15</a>. Additionally, Allen’s 2005–06 record of 269 made in a single season, while bested by the likes of Curry and fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson, still stands as one of the single-greatest shooting seasons in NBA history. Until further notice, his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career mark of 2,973 buckets</a> from three-point territory will be the standard by which all NBA shooters are measured.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_781610" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781610" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Anthony-Davis-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Anthony Davis smiles while watching the Pelicans play." width="757" height="523" /> Anthony Davis has millions of reasons to smile. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Heading into the last <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> offseason, we knew free agency would be a circus. Not only did plenty of talented players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-nba-free-agents-2016.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hit the market</a>, but thanks to the increased revenues from various new TV deals, the salary cap for the 2016–17 season <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16712765/nba-salary-cap-set-941-million-2016-17-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballooned to an obscene $94.1 million</a>. Thanks to this unhealthy cap increase from the year before, even unworthy individuals cashed in big time. While everyone knew this to be true, most were still not fully prepared for the craziness.

As is always the case, some players remained with their current clubs while others bolted, looking to start fresh in a new environment. Although some of the bigger names <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nba-free-agency-names-landed.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shocked us with their decisions</a>, the real head-scratching began when we saw how much money teams willingly threw around -- the ultimate example of "stupid money."

To the surprise of no one, this trend continued during the 2017 offseason, as clubs, again, handed out massive contracts to many of the game's biggest free agents. In fact, we officially witnessed the largest deal in the history of the NBA. With that in mind, here's a look at the 26 biggest NBA contracts of all time.

<h2>26. Gilbert Arenas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_781597" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781597" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gilbert-Arenas-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="Gilbert Arenas looks on during a game against the Cavs." width="757" height="501" /> Gilbert Arenas definitely made his money. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Six years, $111 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Washington Wizards</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2008–13</li>
</ul>
Although Gilbert Arenas' career took a turn for the worse -- following a much-publicized locker room <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-enemies-players-dont-like-each-other.html/">incident with teammate</a>, Javaris Crittenton -- you can't fault the Wizards for investing in the former superstar.

During his stint with the organization, Agent Zero averaged 25 points per game, made three All-Star Game appearances, and was a three-time All-NBA selection. He was plenty deserving of the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=3473164">six-year, $111 million deal</a> the Wizards gave him back in 2008. Still, in the end, that didn't prevent the franchise from shipping him to Orlando in 2010.

<h2>24. (tie) Kevin Love</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750688" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750688" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kevin-Love-Elsa-Getty-Images-e1484253667844.jpg" alt="Kevin Love runs back on defense." width="757" height="611" /> The Cavs made a major investment in Kevin Love. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Five years, $113.2 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Cleveland Cavaliers</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2015–19</li>
</ul>
After being traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014, Kevin Love learned firsthand how difficult it is to occupy the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-best-teammates-of-all-time.html/">same space as the King</a>. Yet, despite the early growing pains, it wasn't long before the four-time All-Star proved just how vital he is to the team's success. This didn't go unnoticed by the higher-ups, as they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cleveland-paid-team-eastern-conference.html/">showed their appreciation</a> in the form of a new <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/kevin-love-6132/">five-year, $113.2 million deal</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>24. (tie) Marc Gasol</h2>
[caption id="attachment_781591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781591" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marc-Gasol-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Marc Gasol celebrates knocking down a three-pointer." width="757" height="609" /> Marc Gasol's contact is reason to celebrate. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Five years, $113.2 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Memphis Grizzlies</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2015–19</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-foreign-nba-players.html/">Marc Gasol</a> might not be the highest-paid player on his team (as you'll soon see), but he's definitely not hurting from a financial standpoint. In 2015, the Grizzlies gave the former Defensive Player of the Year a new contract worth <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/memphis-grizzlies/marc-gasol-6122/">$113.2 million over five years</a>. While Gasol has the option to opt out of the deal after four seasons, something tells us the All-Star center has every intention of staying in Memphis.

<h2>23. Al Horford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_714784" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-714784" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Al-Horford-Michael-Reaves-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Boston Celtics need more than just Al Horford." width="757" height="505" /> Al Horford was a big get for the Boston Celtics. | Michael Reaves/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Four years, $113.3 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Boston Celtics</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2016–19</li>
</ul>
Al Horford was one of the biggest available free agents during the 2016 offseason <span class="s1">-- </span>and for good reason. Since the Atlanta Hawks selected him with the third overall pick in the 2007 draft, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/can-these-college-teammates-please-reunite-in-the-nba.html/">former Florida Gators standout</a> has averaged nearly a double-double, made four All-Star Games, and earned All-NBA honors during the 2010–11 season. As a result, the Boston Celtics made Horford a huge priority, signing him to a <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/al-horford-2199/">four-year, $113.3 million deal</a>.

<h2>22. Chris Bosh</h2>
[caption id="attachment_701468" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-701468" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Chris-Bosh-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chris Bosh celebrates a bucket." width="757" height="541" /> Chris Bosh knows he has game. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Five years, $118.7 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Miami Heat</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2014–18</li>
</ul>
In 2014, following the King's decision to return to Cleveland, the Miami Heat made re-signing <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-completely-changed-game.html/">Chris Bosh</a> priority No. 1. Unfortunately, just because Bosh signed on the dotted line of a new five-year, $118.7 million contract doesn't mean he isn't expendable. Continued blood clotting has, for all intents and purposes, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/miami-heat-planning-screw-chris-bosh.html/">ended CB4's time in Miami</a>.

<h2>20. (tie) Nicolas Batum</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659718" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659718" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Nicolas-Batum-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Nicolas Batum claps after the play." width="757" height="493" /> Nicolas Batum likes what he sees. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Five years, $120 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Charlotte Hornets</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2016–20</li>
</ul>
After averaging a career-high 14.9 points per game during the 2015–16 season, Nicolas Batum was rewarded with a fat contract to remain with the Charlotte Hornets. The organization signed the two-way talent to a five-year, $120 million deal. Not bad for a guy who's never <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nba-all-star-selections-of-all-time.html/">played in an All-Star Game</a>.

<h2>20. (tie) Shaquille O'Neal</h2>

" width="757" height="505" /> They don't get more dominant than Shaquille O'Neal. | Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Seven years, $120 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Los Angeles Lakers</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 1996–02</li>
</ul>
For the first four years of his career, Shaquille O'Neal <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/">asserted his dominance</a> as a member of the Orlando Magic, averaging 27.2 points and 12.5 rebounds per game and making four All-Star teams. Then the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/">Los Angeles Lakers</a> swooped in and <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-19/sports/sp-25797_1_los-angeles-lakers">signed the Diesel</a> to a seven-year, $120 million contract in 1996. We think this move worked out pretty well for them.

<h2>19. Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_667328" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-667328" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tim-Duncan-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x463.jpg" alt="Tim Duncan celebrates during the 2015 NBA Playoffs.

<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Seven years, $122 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: San Antonio Spurs</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2003–09</li>
</ul>
Considering he is arguably the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tim-duncan-greatest-power-forward-history.html/">greatest power forward</a> the game has ever seen, Tim Duncan should rank higher on the list in our opinion. Still, there's nothing shabby about the seven-year, $122 million contract The Big Fundamental signed with the San Antonio Spurs back in 2003. He most certainly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-tim-duncans-nba-career.html/">lived up to every cent</a> of the deal.

<h2>18. Chris Webber</h2>
[caption id="attachment_586958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-586958" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Chris-Webber-Jed-Jacobsohn-Getty-Images-640x428.jpg" alt="Chris Webber is all smiles." width="757" height="506" /> Chris Webber was a force for the Kings. | Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Seven years, $122.7 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Sacramento Kings</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2001–07</li>
</ul>
Although he didn't start his career with the Sacramento Kings, Chris Webber became one of the most prominent figures in franchise history. In seven seasons with the organization, C-Webb averaged 23.5 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game. He made four All-Star teams and earned himself a massive <a href="http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2001/0721/1229333.html">seven-year, $122.7 million contract</a>. Sadly, there's one thing his time in Sacramento didn't yield -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-franchises-longest-title-droughts.html/">a championship</a>.

<h2>17. Joe Johnson</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhGeQWOHwHQ?ecver=1"></iframe>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Six years, $123.7 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Atlanta Hawks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2010–15</li>
</ul>
The Atlanta Hawks' decision to sign Joe Johnson to a <a href="https://twitter.com/CVivlamoreAJC/status/18066396687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">six-year, $123.7 million deal</a> back in 2010 was one of the great head-scratchers of our time. This isn't to say that Johnson didn't have a filthy jumper or hold multiple All-Star Game appearances. On the contrary, he had both of those things on his resume. No, the real issue was the fact that Johson was 29 years old at the time of the deal. Clearly, the Hawks mistook him for LeBron James.

<h2>16. Carmelo Anthony</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702367" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702367" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Carmelo-Anthony_Rich-Barnes_Getty-Images-640x443.jpg" alt="Carmelo Anthony brings up the ball." width="757" height="523" /> Carmelo Anthony has earned his money with the Knicks. | Rich Barnes/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Contract</span>: Five years, $124.1 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: New York Knicks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2014–18</li>
</ul>
Carmelo Anthony doesn't have any rings, but that certainly hasn't hurt his bank account. Just ask the New York Knicks, who <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--carmelo-anthony-returning-to-knicks-175747449.html">re-signed the All-Star</a> back in 2014 to the tune of $124.1 million over five years. Melo might not be the ultimate "<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/all-time-starting-5-for-the-new-york-knicks.html/">team player</a>," but trust us, his overall talent is well worth the money.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 1999–2004</li>
</ul>
The Minnesota Timberwolves took a chance by selecting Kevin Garnett <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-players-who-came-in-straight-from-high-school.html/">right out of high school</a> with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft. Yet, it only took the organization four years to realize the special talent they had. As a result, the T-Wolves retained KG's services in 1999 by giving him a six-year, $126 million deal. Garnett <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-kevin-garnett-career.html/">earned his money</a>, making the next eight straight All-Star Games for Minnesota (12 in a row, including his stint in Boston) and leading the NBA in rebounding from the 2003–04 season through the 2006–07 season.

<h2>13. (tie) Rashard Lewis</h2>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Team</span>: Orlando Magic</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2007–12</li>
</ul>
After averaging 16.6 points per game in his nine seasons with the Seattle SuperSonics <span class="s1">-- </span>including 22.4 points per contest during the 2006–07 season <span class="s1">-- </span>it wasn’t surprising that forward Rashard Lewis was a coveted free agent come the summer of 2007. The Orlando Magic valued him so much that they worked out a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2932827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign-and-trade</a> deal with the Sonics that allowed them to give Lewis a contract worth $126 million over six years.

While the Magic hoped to get a big-time player who could put the ball in the basket, it's safe to say they ended up on the losing end of this agreement. Lewis never put up more than 18.2 points per contest during his brief time in Orlando.

<ul>
 	<li>Contract: Five years, $126 million</li>
 	<li>Team: New Orleans Pelicans</li>
 	<li>Years: 2017–21</li>
</ul>
Although Jrue Holiday hasn't played in an All-Star Game since the 2012–13 season (he was a 76er at the time), the New Orleans Pelicans showed him just how much they value his services. The 27-year-old, who averaged 15.4 points and 7.3 assists per game this past season, was handed a<a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19781149/jrue-holiday-re-sign-new-orleans-pelicans-five-year-126-million-contract"> five-year deal worth $126 million</a>. The Pelicans might never live up to their potential, but at least we know who's tasked with making sure Boogie and The Brow each get their touches.

</ul>
When Jermaine O'Neal joined the Indiana Pacers in 2000 following a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers, the former No. 17 overall pick <span class="s1">-- </span>from the 1996 NBA Draft <span class="s1">-- </span>proved he had the makings of a dominant center. By turning himself into a double-double player, O'Neal earned a massive payday in the summer of 2003 to the tune of seven years, $126.6 million. To this day, it is still considered one of the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1236855-the-worst-100-million-contracts-in-sports-history/page/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst $100 million contracts</a> in sports history.

</ul>
At the time of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13178518/2015-nba-free-agency-new-orleans-pelicans-not-pausing-make-anthony-davis-league-richest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial signing</a>, New Orleans Pelicans superstar <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-nba-players-who-were-kentucky-wildcats.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Davis</a> looked at a potential five-year deal worth an estimated $145 million. However, things don't always work out that way. Due to a 2015–16 campaign in which The Brow failed to start in the All-Star Game or earn All-NBA honors, despite averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24.3 points and 10.3 rebounds</a> per game, Davis failed to meet the qualifications needed to start his max contract 30% of the league's salary cap. Still, $127.2 million over five years is hardly worth complaining about.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2016–20</li>
</ul>
Following his first All-Star Game appearance and a Third-Team All-NBA selection, center Andre Drummond was handsomely rewarded by the Detroit Pistons with a <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/detroit-pistons/andre-drummond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five-year, $127.2 million max contract</a>. Considering he averaged 16.2 points and a league-leading <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/drumman01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14.8 rebounds per game</a> during the 2015–16 season, we'd say the former UConn Husky more than earned this monster payday.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Years</span>: 2016–20</li>
</ul>
Injuries may have hampered Bradley Beal over the last few seasons. However, the Washington Wizards were not about to let their shooting guard, whom they drafted No. 3 overall back in 2012, get away. They signed him to a five-year max contract <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/washington-wizards/bradley-beal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worth a little over $127 million</a>. Here we thought he was called the "Real Deal" because he shoots 39.7% from three-point range. Or perhaps that's just one reason why he earned a real <em>nice</em> deal.

Gordon Hayward has improved each year since being selected by the Utah Jazz with the ninth overall pick in the 2010 draft. This summer, following a career season in 2016–17 that saw him average 21.9 points per game and make his first All-Star Game appearance, Hayward reaped the rewards of all that hard work.

The former Butler standout signed a four-year, $128 million contract with the Boston Celtics, reuniting with his college coach, Brad Steven, and causing the sort of <a href="http://news.cheatsheet.com/sports/gordon-hayward-signs-with-the-celtics-5-best-twitter-reactions.html/">Twitter storm</a> usually reserved for bona fide stars.

</ul>
Back in the summer of 2004, the Los Angeles Lakers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-shooting-guards-of-all-time.html/">had no intention</a> of letting future Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant</a> bolt the City of Angels. As a result, the team signed him to the then-biggest NBA contract in history, worth <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1840336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$136.4 million over seven years</a>. After signing this massive contract, the Black Mamba was clearly ecstatic. "I always wanted to be a Laker," Bryant said. "It’s in my heart. This is what I do, this the team I want to play for and have a chance to finish out my career here."

Considering the fact that The Mamba <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-who-should-have-retired-sooner.html/">retired from the NBA</a> as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, we can safely say he got his wish.

After making the second All-Star Game appearance of his career in 2015–16, shooting guard DeMar DeRozan was shown just how much the Toronto Raptors valued his services. The franchise signed him to a <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/toronto-raptors/demar-derozan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five-year max contract worth $139 million</a>, making him one of the highest-paid players in NBA history.

It may seem like point guard Damian Lillard doesn't get the love he deserves, yet from a financial standpoint, this couldn't be further from the truth. After <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-snubs-of-the-2017-nba-all-star-game.html/">averaging 25.3 points</a> and 6.9 assists per game in 2015–16, which resulted in an All-NBA selection (the second of his career), the escalator clause in Dame's <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/119014/damian-lillard-not-anthony-davis-makes-millions-from-rose-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deal kicked in</a>, resulting in a contract <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/portland-trail-blazers/damian-lillard-10814/">worth almost $140 million over five years</a>.

Despite never playing in an All-Star Game, Mike Conley's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-salary-compares-nba-players.html/">importance to the Memphis Grizzlies</a> is impossible to deny. He is the team's floor leader, their toughness, and by all accounts, their heart.

Stephen Curry's last deal was probably the most team-friendly contract in the National Basketball Association. That all changed in the 2017 offseason, as Curry went from being <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-underpaid-nba-players-today.html/">grossly underpaid</a> to rolling around in Scrooge McDuck money.

The Warriors handed the Baby-Faced Assassin a new five-year, $201 million contract that would pay him an annual average salary of more than $40.2 million. This deal is much more fitting of the two-time MVP's status. Of course, if you ask the King, Curry <a href="https://twitter.com/kingjames/status/881228913350815744">deserves to make more</a>.

</ul>
Few players in the NBA <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/are-you-not-entertained-exciting-players-nba-today.html/">are as exciting</a> as James Harden. A natural scorer with an affinity for getting the basket at will, The Beard recently established himself as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-clutch-nba-players-in-the-game-right-now.html/">one of the premier passers</a> in the game, averaging a league-leading 11.6 assists per game in 2016–17.

As a result, the Rockets decided to take Harden's salary to the next level, giving him a <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/19919869/james-harden-houston-rockets-agree-four-year-extension">four-year, $170 million super-maximum extension</a>. Combined with the two years and $59 million he has remaining on his current deal, Harden is set to make $228 million in guaranteed money through the 2022–23 season. Now that's a lot of "Beard" money.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_713343" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-713343" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/450525068-640x443.jpg" alt="Gregg Popovich gestures to his players during a Spurs game." width="756" height="523" /> One of the best the NBA has ever seen, Gregg Popovich is in a class of his own. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

It was a mundane game by any measure in February 2015, but by coming back to defeat the Indiana Pacers 95-93, the San Antonio Spurs helped Gregg Popovich <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-winningest-coaches-in-nba-playoff-history.html/">win his 1,000th career game</a> as an NBA head coach.

In a career marked by incredible success, Popovich is already considered one of best coaches the league has ever seen. Not only has he continued to win year in and year out, but he’s done it with a single NBA franchise. This is an extremely rare feat. As a matter of fact, so is winning a thousand games. And by doing so, Popovich joined an exclusive list of winningest NBA coaches. Needless to say, two years later, the winning hasn't stopped.

Pop has continued his successful ways beyond the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-tim-duncans-nba-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retirement of Tim Duncan</a>. And he ranks among the nine winningest coaches in NBA history. Let’s look at the other eight on the list.

<h2>9. Rick Adelman</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,042

Rick Adelman spent 23 seasons as a head coach in the NBA. During that span, he roamed the sidelines for the Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, and Minnesota Timberwolves. Adelman may not have won an NBA Championship, but from 1989–92, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nba-teams-90s-except-bulls.html/">did lead Portland</a> to two Western Conference titles in three seasons.

Larry Brown is one of the most respected basketball coaches of all time. In his time as an NBA head coach from 1977 until 2011, Brown recorded a regular<span class="s1">-</span>season winning percentage of .548, won NBA Coach of the Year (2000–01) with the Philadelphia 76ers, and led the Detroit Pistons <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-upsets-in-nba-playoff-history.html/">to an NBA championship</a> during the 2003–04 season.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,150

In his 21 seasons as the head coach of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-1996-97-san-antonio-spurs-built-an-nba-dynasty.html/">San Antonio Spurs</a>, Gregg Popovich has become one of the most accomplished coaches in NBA history. He has won the NBA Coach of the Year award three times, has a regular<span class="s1">-</span>season winning percentage of .694, and has led the Spurs to five NBA championships. He is also the only active coach with over one thousand NBA victories on his already exceptional resume. Popovich is among, if not the biggest, reason why the Spurs <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship.html/">have been so successful</a>.

<h2>6. Phil Jackson</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,155

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/jacksph01c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil Jackson</a> is arguably the greatest coach of all time. Although he is only sixth on the list of winningest NBA coaches, his other accolades are off the charts. Jackson had a .704 regular-season winning percentage, was the 1995-96 Coach of the Year, and won 13 conference championships and 11 NBA titles. Too bad he hasn't had the same sort of success <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/looking-back-at-phil-jackson-biggest-blunders-with-the-knicks.html/">as an executive</a>.

<h2>5. George Karl</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,175

George Karl was an NBA coach for 27 seasons and, during that time, he was a consummate winner. For his career, Karl has only led two teams to a below .500 winning percentage on the season. He won a Western Conference Championship during the 1995–96 season with the Seattle SuperSonics. On top of all that, Karl was named the NBA Coach of the Year in 2012–13.

Karl's last stop was a disastrous stay with the Sacramento Kings. He only managed to add 44 wins to his tally before alienating yet another locker room of NBA talent.

<h2>4. Pat Riley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_756792" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-756792" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pat-Riley.jpg" alt="Pat Riley responds to media questions at a press conference." width="757" height="535" /> He brought LeBron to Miami, but he was a force on the sidelines. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,210

Pat Riley is a fantastic executive. But before all of his success in the front office, Riley was a master on the bench. In his 24 years <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-hated-coaches.html/">as an NBA head coach</a>, Riley led his teams to nine conference titles and five NBA championships. On top of that, he won NBA Coach of the Year three times.

<h2>3. Jerry Sloan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_756796" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-756796" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jerry-Sloan.jpg" alt="Jerry Sloan waves his hands at his players." width="757" height="520" /> Jerry Sloan only coached one franchise in the NBA. | John G. Mabanglo/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,221

Jerry Sloan spent his entire 26-year coaching career with the Utah Jazz. He won 1,221 games, which is a lot of winning with one organization. During that time, he managed to lead the Jazz out of the Western Conference twice. Unfortunately, on both of those occasions, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall">came up against</a> Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the NBA Finals.

<h2>2. Lenny Wilkens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_756800" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-756800" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lenny-Wilkens.jpg" alt="Lenny Wilkins argues a call with a ref." width="757" height="563" /> Lenny Wilkins has kept a relatively low profile, but he was a winning coach. | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,332

In addition to winning 1,332 games during his 32 years as an NBA head coach, Lenny Wilkens was named the NBA Coach of the Year for the 1993–94 season. He also has an NBA title under his belt from when he led the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/1979.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle SuperSonics to the crown</a> in 1979.

<h2>1. Don Nelson</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wins</span>: 1,335

Don Nelson tops the list of winningest coaches in NBA history. In his 31-year coaching career, Nelson accumulated a ridiculous 1,335 victories. He was also a three-time recipient of the NBA Coach of the Year award. Unfortunately, despite all of his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-a-pro-sports-team-rebuild-actually-worked.html/?a=viewall">regular-season success</a>, Don Nelson was never able to lead a team to an NBA championship. Regardless, he is still one of the most elite head coaches the sport has ever seen.

When the Brooklyn Nets announced that they waived Joe Johnson, we couldn't help but shake our heads. Not only was the former <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-8-nba-players-with-the-most-all-star-appearances.html/">All-Star</a> guard now receiving the opportunity to play for a contender (until the Miami Heat were eliminated from the playoffs that is), but the Nets had essentially admitted what the majority of us already knew: Their plan to trade for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-biggest-contracts-in-nba-history.html/">big-name talent</a> at the cost of tons of assets was a complete disaster.

It's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-5-greatest-nba-teams-never-to-win-a-championship.html/">not easy to win championships</a> in the NBA. And sometimes, in the name of reaching the top of the mountain, clubs will risk a lot in the hopes of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-underdog-won-nba-championship.html/">achieving quick success</a>. Focusing on the trio pictured above, it's clear that strategy does not always pan out. But trust us, it could always be worse. NBA history gives us plenty of examples of catastrophic trades. However, the way we see it, these are the 12 worst trades in NBA history.

<h2>12. The Big O is traded to Milwaukee</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708411" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708411" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Oscar-Robertson-National-Player-Of-The-Year-Award-10-640x427.jpg" alt="Oscar Robertson addresses the media." width="757" height="505" /> How could you trade Oscar Robertson? | Maxx Wolfson/Getty Images[/caption]

During his 10 seasons with the Cincinnati Royals, Oscar Robertson was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-dominant-players-in-ncaa-mens-basketball-history.html/">pretty much unstoppable</a>. He went to 10 straight All-Star Games, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberos01.html">averaged 29.3 points</a>, 7.5 rebounds, and 10.3 assists per game, and won the MVP award during the 1963–64 season. And yet, in 1970, the Royals thought it'd be a good idea to trade an aging Robertson to the Milwaukee Bucks for Charlie Paulk and Flynn Robinson. It wasn't.

Although The Big O didn't put up crazy numbers in his four seasons in Milwaukee, he did help Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- seriously, in what world is it fair that those two are teammates? -- bring the organization its first and only title in 1970–71. Meanwhile, the Royals left Cincinnati following the 1971–72 season. Ouch.

<h2>11. Memphis practically gives away Pau Gasol</h2>
[caption id="attachment_777405" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-777405" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Los-Angeles-Lakers-Gabriel-Bouys-AFP-Getty-Images-640x457.jpg" alt="Pau Gasol and Kobe Bryant chat on the bench." width="757" height="540" /> Pau Gasol (L) helped Kobe Bryant bring multiple titles to Los Angeles. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The reason the rich tend to get richer is because folks continuously hand them quality goods for peanuts. Case in point: When the Memphis Grizzlies traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2008. Sure, the Grizz received Pau's brother, Marc -- an eventual superstar sibling in his own right -- in return, but to call this transaction "lopsided" would be an understatement. Simply put, it was highway robbery.

In Pau, Kobe got the perfect complementary teammate; one who could help him <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nba-champions-in-league-history.html/">add two more championships</a> to his resume. Memphis, on the other hand, received a couple of future draft picks, the younger Gasol, Aaron McKie, and the "dynamic duo" of Kwame Brown and Javaris Crittenton. Only in Hollywood.

<h2>10. Bucks say, 'bye, bye' to Nowitzki</h2>
[caption id="attachment_629301" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-629301 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DirkNowitzkiSanAntonioSpursvDallasMavericksh5tcKDJR-ckl.jpg" alt="Dirk knocks down the jumper." width="757" height="500" /> Dirk has been money in Dallas. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

In the 1998 NBA Draft, the Milwaukee Bucks had the surprising foresight to select an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-foreign-nba-players.html/">international player from Germany</a> by the name of Dirk Nowitzki with the No. 9 overall pick. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for the same organization to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-players-every-franchises-history.html/">throw it all away</a>.

For reasons beyond comprehension, the Bucks shipped Nowitzki -- along with Pat Garrity -- off to Dallas in exchange for Michigan's Robert "Tractor" Traylor (the No. 6 overall pick in the 1998 draft). While Traylor lasted seven seasons in the league, starting just 73 games, Nowitzki went on to forge a surefire Hall of Fame career while becoming one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nba-power-forwards-of-all-time.html/">greatest scorers</a> in NBA history (currently No. 6 on the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time scoring list</a>). That has to hurt.

<h2>9. 76ers send Barkley to Phoenix</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621678" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621678" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Charles-Barkley-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The 10 Worst Trades in NBA History" width="757" height="505" /> Charles Barkley looks on prior to the start of the 2016 National Championship game. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1992, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-most-memorable-moments-of-charles-barkleys-broadcasting-career.html/">Charles Barkley</a> wanted out of Philadelphia, and the Sixers were happy to oblige him, shipping the future Hall of Famer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/18/sports/basketball-bright-day-for-suns-they-get-barkley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">off to the Phoenix Suns</a>. Yet, here's the thing: If you're going to trade a player who just averaged 23.1 points and 11.1 rebounds per game the season before, you better make sure you get a substantial value in return. The 76ers, of course, did not.

In exchange for the player who went on to win the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barklch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVP award</a> in the 1992–93 season, Philadelphia received Jeff Hornacek, Andrew Lang, and Tim Perry. Is it any wonder the Sixers failed to make the playoffs for the next six years? We think not.

<h2>8. Portland opts to trade Malone</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnECcbtbyj4"></iframe>

The Portland Trail Blazers received two picks in the dispersal draft following the 1975–76 season. With the second of those two selections, the Blazers took Moses Malone from the <a>Spirits of St. Louis -- a slam-dunk pick if we've ever seen one. Too bad the organization didn't seem to feel the same way.</a>

In exchange for a 1978 first-round pick, which they eventually used on Rick Robey, Portland sent the Chairman of the Boards to the Buffalo Braves. By the time Malone's career ended, he earned three MVP awards, played in 12 NBA All-Star Games, scored <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonmo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27,409 points</a> (No. 8 all time), and pulled down 16,212 rebounds (No. 5 all time). Talk about a classic Portland Trail Blazers draft decision; it sort of reminds us of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-losing-the-nba-draft-lottery-changed-basketball-in-okc.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>.

<h2>7. Cavs give Worthy to the Lakers</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VSyRkGkMy8U"></iframe>

For the record, the Cleveland Cavaliers didn't trade James Worthy to the Los Angeles Lakers. They simply traded away the pick that eventually landed the future <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/">purple and gold Hall of Famer</a>. How is that possible? We'll explain.

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1980.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1979–80 Cavs</a>, a team that finished the season with a 37-45 record, opted to trade their 1982 first-round pick and Butch Lee to the Lakers for Don Ford and LA's first-round selection in the upcoming 1980 draft (because that's exactly what you should do when your team is terrible and the team you make a deal with is about to win the NBA title). As we're sure you've figured out by now, that 1982 pick turned into a No. 1 overall, which the Lakers used to select Worthy. Or as we like to call him "<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/worthja01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Game James</a>."
<h2><!--nextpage-->6. Sonics trade Pippen to the Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_608282" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-608282" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Payton-and-Pippen-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="The 10 Worst Trades in NBA History" width="757" height="504" /> Gary Payton (L) and Scottie Pippen chat during the NBA Finals. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Using a pick that originally belonged to the New York Knicks, the Seattle Supersonics selected Scottie Pippen No. 5 overall in the 1987 NBA Draft. However, in exchange for Olden Polynice, a 1988 second-round pick, and a first-round pick in 1989, the Sonics thought it'd be wise to ship Pippen -- along with a 1989 first-round pick of their own -- to Chicago. Big mistake.

Pippen went on to help Michael Jordan and the Bulls capture six championships. He put together a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hall-of-Fame career</a> of his own, and he was named one of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">50 greatest players in NBA history</a>. The Sonics, well, they now reside in Oklahoma City. We're sure the people of Seattle are over this faux pas by now. Someone should ask them.

<h2>5. Lakers get Kobe from the Hornets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_625506" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-625506" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Worst Trades in NBA History" width="757" height="504" /> Kobe Bryant warms up prior to a game against the Pelicans. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

This is why you shouldn't agree to a pre-draft trade with the Los Angeles Lakers (or Jerry West). Even though you may do a deal that makes sense in the short run, you never know when it could ultimately cost you a once-in-a-generation talent.

Prior to the 1996 Draft, the then-Charlotte Hornets agreed to select Kobe Bryant with the 13th overall pick and trade him to the Lakers for center Vlade Divac. Aside from the crazy amount of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-best-performances-of-kobe-bryants-career.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standout performances</a> throughout his career, the future Hall of Famer officially retired with 18 All-Star appearances, five NBA titles, and a spot in the top three on the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-new-top-12-all-time-nba-scorers.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time scoring list</a>. At least one team got a Hollywood ending out of this deal.
<h2><!--nextpage-->4. Philadelphia decides to trade Wilt to LA</h2>
[caption id="attachment_604718" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-604718" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wilt-Chamberlain-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images-640x431.jpg" alt="The 10 Worst Trades in NBA History" width="757" height="510" /> Wilt Chamberlain addresses the media before the NBA All-Star Game. | Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

During his four seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, Wilt Chamberlain shot 58.3% from the field while averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21.5 points</a>, 18.6 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game. He was a physically overpowering specimen, a dominating force of nature, and the kind of player who, not only can't be stopped, but only comes around once in a lifetime. But he wanted out of Philadelphia. And for some reason, the Sixers obliged him.

In return for acquiring one of the greatest talents in the history of the game, the Los Angeles Lakers traded Jerry Chambers, Archie Clark, and Darrall Imhoff to the Sixers. Who? Exactly.

<h2>3. Bucks ship Kareem to Hollywood</h2>

Despite helping the Bucks win a title in 1970<span class="s1">–</span>71 and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">averaging 30.4 points</a> and 15.3 rebounds per game during his six seasons with the franchise, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-nba-players-who-are-scoring-maniacs.html/">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> did not want to be in Milwaukee anymore. The organization didn't care about his request, and they forced him to stay put for the rest of his career. Just kidding. Life's not that fair.

Milwaukee traded Jabbar -- and Walt Wesley -- to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Junior Bridgeman, Dave Meyers, Elmore Smith, and Brian Winters. By parting with the Hall of Famer, the Bucks essentially threw their NBA championship dreams out the window. Meanwhile, with Jabbar in the fold, the Lakers hoisted five banners into the rafters. Like we said, life really isn't fair.
<h2><!--nextpage-->2. Jazz lose out on Magic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_599155" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-599155" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Magic-Johnson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="The 10 Worst Trades in NBA History" width="757" height="502" /> Magic Johnson looks on before the game. | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Back in the late '70s, when the Jazz resided in New Orleans, the organization was keen on acquiring Lakers guard Gail Goodrich. However, even though they signed Goodrich as a free agent, per league rules, the Jazz needed to work out some sort of compensation deal with those fine folks in Los Angeles. Suffice to say, this one backfired. Big time.

While the Jazz received Gail Goodrich, Essie Givens and Jack Givens, the Lakers, in return, would get Kenny Carr, Freemen Williams, Sam Worthen, and <span class="s1">-- </span>wait for it <span class="s1">-- </span>New Orleans' 1979 first-round pick; a pick who would not only turned out to be No. 1 overall, but also be responsible for bringing Showtime to Hollywood. For one of these franchises, this deal was a disaster. For the other, it was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pure Magic</a>.

Although this deal took place at a time when an NBA owner could actually use the <a href="http://wagesofwins.com/2010/06/15/trading-the-ice-capades-for-bill-russell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice Capades as a bargaining chip</a>, that doesn't make it any less blasphemous. Boston Celtics head coach Red Auerbach got Bill Russell from the St. Louis Hawks -- who selected him with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1956 NBA Draft -- in exchange for Cliff Hagan, Ed Macauley, and the seventh overall pick in the same draft. And just like that, a dynasty was born.

With the Celtics, Russell became <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 12-time All-Star</a>, win five MVP awards, and capture 11 NBA championships. To this day, all terrible trades that go down in the NBA get compared to this one (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/was-the-steve-nash-deal-the-worst-nba-trade-for-a-star-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sorry, Steve Nash</a>). As they should. But let's be real, no matter how bad a deal ends up, it will never as bad as the time the Hawks got rid of the great Bill Russell.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_746675" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-746675" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Steve-Nash-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Greatest NBA Point Guards of All Time" width="756" height="565" /> Steve Nash drives to the basket. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

The point guard <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/popular/9-shortest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best captures the imagination of the weekend warrior</a>, accommodating all shapes and sizes -- from 5-foot-3 Tyrone “Mugsey" Bouges and doughboy Khalid El-Amin to the 6-foot-9 force that was Magic Johnson. An elite point guard can completely dominate the game without even scoring.

The best point men are typically pass-first team players who subjugate their own offensive talent to get teammates involved in the flow of the basketball game. For that reason, assist totals are a leading indicator of point guard play. With that, here’s our take on the top 10 NBA point guards of all time.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honorable Mention</span>: Steve Nash will go down as one of the most efficient offensive players in the history of basketball. While the tail end of Nash’s career -- with the Los Angeles Lakers -- was marred by nagging injuries in conjunction with a monstrous contract, we'll always remember him for his playing days with the Phoenix Suns; a run that single-handedly popularized the constant pick and roll you see today.

<h2>10. Kevin Johnson</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifx_gRF-ouU" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Armed with a deadly first step and high-top fade, Kevin Johnson worked his signature crossover dribble to perfection. Classic KJ would go rope-a-dope, where he would hesitate and lean to his left, just before crossing back over to the right and exploding into the paint.

As a finisher, 6-foot-1 Kevin had the hops to give the business to all comers at the rim, including Hakeem Olajuwon. In Phoenix, little people everywhere prevailed, as No. 7 climbed the ladder to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-when-kevin-johnson-brought-the-hammer-down-on-hakeem-olajuwon.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throw down a thunderous jam upon The Dream’s neck</a>. For the majority of his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnske02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13-year career</a>, KJ sparked a high-octane offense in the Valley of the Sun, with 6,711 career assists, three All-Star nominations, and one NBA Finals appearance.

At the height of his powers, KJ joined the ranks of Isiah Thomas, Magic, and Oscar Robertson as the only point guards in history who were automatic for 20 points and 10 assists each night. In 1991, Kevin, the eventual mayor of Sacramento, slapped together 22 points, 10 assists, and four rebounds per game.

<h2>9. Chris Paul</h2>
[caption id="attachment_727641" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="size-full wp-image-727641" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Chris-Paul-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="750" /> Chris Paul remains the key to the Los Angeles Clippers' success | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

At the tender age of 31, Chris Paul has already thrown his name into the ring as one of the all-time greats at point guard. As he honed his skills at Wake Forest, Paul emerged as another product of the ACC point guard blueprint that preached intelligence, heart, and above all else, the pick and roll. As a member of Lob City, Paul mastered the art of feeding both Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan at the front of the rim for hammer dunks.

At 6-foot and 175 pounds, Paul has always been deceptively quick. On the perimeter, he can be impossible to contain, as he barrels into the lane at will to either set the table for a cutting big man, kick the ball out to sharpshooter J.J. Redick for an open three, or even finish himself with either hand at the rim.

In half-court sets, Paul has also mastered the art of the step-back three, where he feints a drive, delivers a forearm shiver, and fades behind the arc to knock down clutch jumpers, firing up the Staples Center crowd. For his career, Paul <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has averaged</a> nearly 19 points, 10 assists, and 2.3 steals per game.

<h2>8. Jason Kidd</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746700" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746700" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jason-Kidd-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Greatest NBA Point Guards of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Jason Kidd is so focused right now | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Similar to Magic Johnson, Jason Kidd did not need to score a point to dominate the game. Once nicknamed Ason, for his lack of a “J" (or jumpshot), Kidd’s career has been nothing short of remarkable.

In all, he <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/k/kiddja01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closed out his 19-year career</a> with one NBA championship, two Olympic gold medals, 10 All-Star game appearances, 1,988 three-point conversions, 12,091 assists (second of all time), and 2,684 steals (second of all time). As a triple-double machine, Kidd was a stat sheet stuffer, who finished among the all-time leaders for point guards in every significant statistical category.

In his prime, Kidd was a speed demon who arguably starred as the league’s fastest end-to-end performer. He was at his best in a freelance, up-tempo game, where he could turn on the jets and find the right man at the right place in transition. Over time, Kidd aged gracefully into the elder Mavericks statesmen, who facilitated half-court sets and even added a consistent three-point shot to his offensive arsenal.

<h2>7. Walt “Clyde" Frazier</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORkc4GjJ3bg" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

Walt “Clyde" Frazier was just too cool for school. As a Knick, Frazier owned New York in the '70s on the strength of his well-coiffed afro, mutton-chop sideburns, tailored suits, fur coats, fedora hats, Rolls Royce cars, and two NBA Championships. Frazier was the charismatic leader of a Knicks Dream Team, which included fellow and future Hall of Famers Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas, Willis Reed, Earl “The Pearl" Monroe, and Zen Master Phil Jackson amongst its ranks.

At lead guard, only the calm, cool, and collected Frazier could put this cast of characters in check. Frazier put on a show in the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19691970.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clinching Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals</a> versus the Los Angeles Lakers. Beneath the bright lights of Madison Square Garden, Frazier paced his Knicks to the tune of 36 points and 19 assists. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Gary Payton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746716" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746716" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gary-Payton-Otto-Gruele-Jr.-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Greatest NBA Point Guards of All Time" width="757" height="492" /> Gary Payton handles the ball. | Otto Gruele Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Gary Payton was the greatest defensive point guard of all time. Nicknamed “The Glove," Payton initially earned recognition as a ball hawk for his ability to shut down the likes of Kevin Johnson, John Stockton, and Steve Nash. With his wiry strength, physical style of play, and non-stop trash talk, Payton also starred as the rare athlete who could get into the head of the great Michael Jordan.

In the 1996 NBA Finals, Payton harassed Jordan into a subpar performance (by his Airness’s standards). Payton held Jordan to 23, 26, and 22 points in the final three games of the series. As a member of the Seattle SuperSonics, Payton was the mastermind behind bang-bang alley-oop plays to “Man-Child" Shawn Kemp. In addition to the flair for the dramatic, Payton was fundamentally sound, as he thrived in the post to cook opponents with head fakes, turnaround jumpers, and a lethal drop step toward the goal.

During the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paytoga01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1999-2000 season</a>, GP put it all together to average 24 points, nine assists, and seven boards per game in one of the greatest statistical performances in NBA history. In the twilight of his career, Payton finally rode off into the sunset as an NBA champion with the 2006 Miami Heat.

<h2>5. John Stockton</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqDjt6dYzVI" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

As far as style was concerned, John Stockton was the anti-Clyde Frazier. With his choir boy looks and comb-over haircut, Stockton appeared equally ready to either prepare your income taxes or throw on a pair of butt-hugger shorts and school all comers out on the basketball floor. As a professional, Stockton was most notable for the economic efficiency of his game.

As the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA’s all-time assist leader</a> (15,806 career assists), he played the angles to perfection, never committed to pounding the ball unnecessarily, and he appeared to always instinctively make the right decision at the right time. Stock’s limited use of steps made for a deceptively fast floor general who often blew right past defenders out on the perimeter, despite his apparent lack of raw athleticism.

As the ultimate scrapper, No. 12 would scratch, claw, grab, and battle his way into position on each and every possession. On the pick and roll, Stockton hooked up with Karl “The Mailman" Malone for an ongoing montage of pretty-boy hand-behind-the-head dunks, and-one layups, and mid-range jump shots. To keep defenses honest, Stockton would sometimes curl off the Malone screen and fake the pass to The Mailman before stepping back behind the arc and knocking down a three from deep.

<h2>4. Bob Cousy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746728" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746728" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bob-Cousy-Chip-Somodevilla-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Greatest NBA Point Guards of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Bob Cousy speaks his mind| Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images[/caption]

At first, nobody wanted Bob Cousy. As a young journeyman, he forced himself upon the Boston Celtics after he <a href="http://www.thescore.com/news/552146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to report</a> to the Tri Cities Blackhawks. After the Chicago Stags organization folded, Cousy signed on with the 1950 Celtics for $9,000 in salary. At the time, Celtics brass and head honcho Red Auerbach doubted that Cousy’s “local yokel” style and gimmicks could translate into success at the professional level.

Cousy, of course, went on to serve as the original building block for a budding dynasty. By his second season, he earned the nickname “Houdini of the Hardwood," as he dazzled fans with his slick ball-handling, no-look passes, and 20 points-per-game average. After his sophomore campaign, “The Cooz" went on to lead the NBA in assists for <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cousybo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight consecutive seasons</a> between 1953 and 1960.

In 1959, Cousy slapped together 20 points, nine rebounds, and six assists per game, as the primary spark plug for Auerbach’s high-octane offense. The Celtic Tradition now prides itself upon team play and winning championships. Between 1957 and 1963, Cousy joined forces with The Great Bill Russell to bring home six NBA Championships in seven years.

<h2>3. Isiah Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657275" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657275" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Isiah-Thomas-MICHAEL-E.-SAMOJEDEN-AFP-Getty-Images-640x418.jpg" alt="Isiah Thomas announces his retirement. | MICHAEL E. SAMOJEDEN/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="494" /> Isiah Thomas left the game as one of the greats | MICHAEL E. SAMOJEDEN/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite his baby face and radiant smile, Isiah Thomas was the Baddest of the Bad Boys. In Detroit, he was the ringleader for a collection of goons who thrived upon intimidation, dust ups, and rough-and-tumble play. The group, in its prime, gave both Jordan and Scottie Pippen fits as Detroit enforced the Jordan Rules, which called for Piston enforcers to close out on drives in the paint and slam the more athletic Bulls players into the basketball support.

For years, many notable basketball historians had <a href="http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/06/michael-jordan-finally-admits-that-he-kept-isiah-thomas-off-the-1992-olympic-dream-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rightfully speculated</a> that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/michael-jordans-5-biggest-nba-rivals.html/">bad blood between Detroit and Chicago</a> ultimately kept Thomas off the 1992 Dream Team. However, he did win back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, between the Lakers, Celtics, and Bulls dynasties. In true point guard form, he looked to get the likes of Joe Dumars, Bill Laimbeer, and Mark Aguirre involved throughout the first three quarters of each game. As a passer, Thomas averaged 9.3 assists per game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thomais01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throughout his 13-year career</a>.

In 1985, he led the NBA with 1,123 assists, or 13.9 dimes per game. As a scorer, Thomas often waited until crunch time to dominate. In the fourth quarter, he was especially notable for scoring points in bunches off an array of jumpers, dribble drives, and baby hooks. Thomas, again, was the ultimate link between championship dynasties in Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

As a young buck, he averaged 26 points per game in an '85 playoff run that ended against Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics. In defeat, Thomas infamously had his inbounds pass stolen by Bird, who flipped a pass to Dennis Johnson for the clinching lay-up.

Three short seasons later, Thomas also hobbled his way to a sensational 25 points in one quarter against Magic Johnson and the LA Lakers, en route to a 1988 NBA Finals loss. After winning two titles, the Bad Boy run came to a crashing halt in Chicago. In 1991, Thomas refused to shake hands with the Bulls and led his Pistons off the Chicago Stadium floor after being swept out of the playoffs.

<h2>2. Oscar Robertson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746735" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746735" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Oscar-Robertson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Greatest NBA Point Guards of All Time" width="757" height="575" /> Oscar Robertson walks onto the floor. | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Oscar Robertson was a force. Over the course of 14 seasons between the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks, Robertson put up unbelievable numbers to dominate the NBA. For his part, the Big O has ranked as a single-season leader in points, assists, free-throw attempts, free-throw percentage, and minutes played.

As the ultimate measure of his all-around game and end-to-end play, he tallied a record 181 triple-doubles, which included a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberos01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remarkable 1962 run</a>, where he averaged 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists per game. As a young star, Robertson did everything for the moribund Cincinnati Royals franchise. Through his first five years as a professional, Robertson averaged more than 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists per contest.

After a 1970 trade to the Milwaukee Bucks, he was finally able to showcase his skills to the benefit of a winning program. Teamed up with a young Lew Alcindor, Robertson helped lead his Milwaukee Bucks to a 4-0 NBA Finals sweep over the Baltimore Bullets that season.

<h2>1. Magic Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_599155" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-599155" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Magic-Johnson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="Stephen Dunn/Getty Images" width="757" height="502" /> There's only one Magic | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

At 6-foot-9, Magic Johnson starred as the only NBA athlete who could perform at a high level at all five positions. As a rookie in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals, the Magic Man subbed in for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to record 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists. As a backdrop, Magic’s all-around performance came against Julius Erving’s Philadelphia 76ers, and clinched the first of his five titles with the Los Angeles Lakers.

From there, assistant coach Pat Riley was ultimately promoted as head coach, and Showtime was born on the West Coast. In Showtime, Magic was a one-man fast break who could crash the boards, control the basketball, and push the tempo. In the open court, Magic often fed the likes of Big Game James Worthy, Byron Scott, A.C. Green, and Michael Cooper with pinpoint no-look passes for easy buckets.

Magic’s uptempo style and Hollywood marquee showmanship made for the perfect contrast in heated battles between the Lakers and Celtics. Between 1983 and 1987, Magic’s Lakers won two out of three heated NBA Finals matchups against the Boston Celtics, who were a dynasty in their own right. As a winner and consummate team player, Magic closed out his career <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 10,141 assists</a> (now fifth of all time) and claimed five NBA titles.

		<description><![CDATA[With the release of ESPN's '30 for 30' documentary, "The Magic Moment," we were reminded of the incredible effect the best NBA duos can have on the NBA.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOd_jMDIpw8"></iframe>

Drama, excitement, heartbreak, and the thrill of victory. These are just a few things that make sports so powerful. Fortunately for us, through the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-best-espns-30-for-30-documentaries-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">masterful storytelling of ESPN's <em>30 for 30</em> documentaries</a>, we've had the opportunity to gain insight into past events that embody these characteristics (and so much more). Yet, in spite of the importance of said traits, there just so happens to be one major theme we haven't touched upon; one theme that tends to have a significant place throughout the history of sports. The simple, yet painstakingly gut-wrenching question that has plagued many teams and individuals: What if?

With the release of the <em>30 for 30</em> documentary, "<a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thismagicmoment" target="_blank">This Magic Moment</a>," we were given the chance to look at this theme by focusing on the Orlando Magic of the mid-'90s; a team with infinite potential. That is, until Shaquille O'Neal left for Los Angeles, breaking up the dynamic duo of Shaq and Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway.

So, we got to thinking about <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank">NBA</a> duos in general. While Shaq and Penny never fully realized their potential, others throughout history took full advantage of the power that comes with a lethal one-two punch. With that in mind, here's a look at who we believe represent the five most accomplished best NBA duos of all time.
<h2>5. Bob Cousy and Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_786599" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-786599 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bill-Russell-Staff-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NBA Duos to Ever Play on the Court Together" width="757" height="510" /> Bill Russell looks on. | Staff/Getty Images[/caption]

Bob Cousy and Bill Russell (pictured) were the building blocks of a Celtics tradition. Together, Cousy and Russell won six championships in seven years, between 1956 and 1963, through solid fundamentals and team play.

While Cousy retired after the ’63 season (he would later play seven games for the Cincinnati Royals in the ’69-’70 season), Russell went on to claim five more rings before passing the torch over to John Havlicek.

At center, Russell anchored the Celtics defense, as he mastered the art of both anticipating shot caroms for rebounds and rotating into the paint for weak-side blocks. After controlling the possession, Russell would outlet the ball to the Cooz, who would lead the break.

At the opposite end, Cousy would often reward the hustling big man with a sweet pass at the front of the rim. It’s no coincidence that Russell and Cousy led the NBA in rebounds and assists per game, respectively, through three consecutive seasons.

<h2>4. John Stockton and Karl Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_788112" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-788112 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/John-Stockton-Karl-Malone-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NBA Duos to Ever Play on the Court Together" width="757" height="502" /> John Stockton (L) and Karl Marlone speak at a press conference. | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

John Stockton and Karl Malone are two of the greatest individual performers to have never won a championship. On a near-nightly basis, Stockton and Malone would compete against the likes of Magic and Kareem, Tim Duncan and David Robinson, Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal simply to get out of the rugged West.

As individuals, Stockton dished out a record 15,806 assists, while the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html" target="_blank">Mailman racked up 36,928 career points</a>, a total still good for second most in NBA history. The phrase “Stockton to Malone” delighted the Jazz faithful between 1985 and 2003, and the two even took home co-MVP awards at the 1993 All-Star Game in Salt Lake City.

On the pick and roll, Stockton would repeatedly hit Malone in stride for layups, baby hooks, scoop shots, and behind-the-head dunks. If left alone, Stockton would simply curl off a Malone screen to knock down a deep three-point bomb and swing the momentum.

In making two back-to-back trips to the NBA Finals, in 1997 and 1998, Stockton and Malone went down to the all-around play and heroics of Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan. With time winding down, Jordan feinted a hard to the right from the top of the key before planting hard, crossing back over to the left, and burying the game winning jump shot to close out the 1998 Finals in front of Bryon Russell and a shocked Utah crowd.

<h2>3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791274" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791274 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kareem-and-Magic-Kevork-Djansezian-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NBA Duos to Ever Play on the Court Together" width="757" height="560" /> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (L) and Magic Johnson share a laugh. | Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

As teammates, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar represented both a devastating inside-out combination and a changing of the guard in Laker Land and atop the NBA. As a 20-year-old rookie, Magic filled in for the injured elder statesman (Kareem was 32 at the time)  at center in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals. That evening, Johnson blitzed Dr. J and the Philadelphia 76ers for 42 points, 15 rebounds, and 7 assists in claiming Finals MVP honors. The NBA was officially on notice.

By midpoint of the 1981-1982 season, Showtime was born. As a one-man fast break, Johnson would crash the boards, control the basketball, and run the team at a breakneck pace. As a passer, Magic would thread the needle through impossible angles to wings James Worthy and Scott for easy dunks and wide-open jump shots.

In half-court sets, Magic would dump the ball down to Kareem, where the most prolific scorer of all time would go to work. In the post, Kareem would pound the ball for two dribbles before pushing off the floor with his off leg and dropping a sky hook into the bottom of the net.

In Game 4 of the 1987 Finals, Magic took a page out of Kareems’s book in driving toward the middle of the paint and hitting his own game-winning <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/magichook_moments.html" target="_blank">baby sky-hook</a> as time expired. Ultimately, Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar would win five championships together, in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988.

<h2>2. Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791288 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kobe-Bryant-Shaq-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NBA Duos to Ever Play on the Court Together" width="757" height="512" /> Kobe Bryant (L) and Shaquille O'Neal celebrate an NBA title. | AFP/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1996, Laker legend and General Manager Jerry West negotiated a series of trades and draft day deals that landed both Shaquille O’Neal and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> in Los Angeles. For O’Neal, this was his second rodeo, after starring alongside Anfernee “Penny” Hardaway in Orlando and losing his then only trip to the Finals. Bryant, however, was a wunderkind fresh out of high school who would spend his rookie year providing instant offense off the bench behind Eddie Jones.

With time, of course, Bryant improved his outside shooting touch while also adding a series of crafty post moves to his offensive repertoire. By his fourth year in the league, at 21, Kobe Bryant was putting up 23 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, and being compared to Michael Jordan.

That season, Shaq was an unstoppable force in dominating opposing big men for 30 points, 14 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocks per game. In the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers capped a feverish Game 7 comeback against the Portland Trail Blazers, with Kobe chasing down a loose ball at the top of the key and tossing up a lob pass to O’Neal for a one-handed jam.

In all, Shaq and Kobe made four trips to the Finals, winning three, in 2000, 2001, and 2002, as part of a threepeat. By 2004, however, the Lakers had degenerated into dysfunction, with Bryant and O’Neal wrestling for control over the team. While the Lakers did return to the Finals that year, they were blown out in five games by a cohesive Detroit Pistons group that many saw as the antithesis to the star-studded Lakers lineup.

After that the Buss family shipped O’Neal off to Miami and handed the keys of the franchise over to Bryant. For years, Kobe and Shaq continued to trade barbs with each other through interviews, championship parades, and awkward freestyle raps.

<h2>1. Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791295" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791295 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Brian-Bahr-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NBA Duos to Ever Play on the Court Together" width="757" height="473" /> Scottie Pippen (L) and Michael Jordan speak to the media. | Brian Bahr/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In terms of basketball pedigree, you couldn’t find two more polar opposites than the wings for the Chicago Bulls’ enduring dynasty: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/michael-jordan/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> and Scottie Pippen. Jordan, of course, introduced himself to the world immediately after hitting a deep corner jumper late in the game to take the NCAA Championship for Carolina.

As a rookie, in 1984, M.J. immediately went to work to eviscerate all comers for 28 points per game. Alternatively, the SuperSonics drafted Pippen out of Central Arkansas in 1987 and promptly traded his rights to the Bulls. A defensive specialist, Pip would develop his game over time after going toe-to-toe against the mercurial Jordan behind closed doors in heated practices.

The strength of the Jordan-Pippen partnership was largely forged in playoff runs against the Bad Boy Pistons group that turned back the Bulls in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

In 1991, however, the Bulls were back, and a more determined squad swept the Pistons, 4-0, in the Eastern Conference Finals. From there, Jordan and Pippen went on to bring home six championships. Perhaps no more lasting image of the pair exists than Pippen carrying His Airness, the flu-ridden Finals MVP, off the floor in Utah.

		<description><![CDATA[For every talented, young player, there’s one who was drafted in the NBA lottery and is a total bust. Here are the 5 biggest draft busts of the last decade.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_713648" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713648" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Michael-Carter-Williams-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Carter-Williams of the Milwaukee Bucks reacts to a call." width="757" height="537" /> Michael Carter-Williams faced some tough times after the NBA draft. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Odds are, if you're an NBA lottery pick who won the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-underdog-picks-2016-17-rookie-year.html/">Rookie of the Year award</a> in 2014 and garnered comparisons to Magic and the Big O, you're probably not thinking that you're going to suit up for three teams in three seasons. That is exactly what's happening to former Philadelphia 76er Michael Carter-Williams, who Philly traded to Milwaukee for a future Lakers' first rounder. (The trade also included Phoenix, who nabbed Brandon Knight from the Bucks in the deal.) Then, Milwaukee moved him to Chicago for Tony Snell, his draft class mate (Snell served as the 20th overall pick in the 2013 class).

Hardly a bust, Williams is not even the worst player from the 2013 class -- more on that in a second. But it's clear that his stock fell dramatically in the last couple years. Say what you will about Sam Hinkie, but that was one deal he definitely got right.

The MCW trade happened during the last vestiges of the NBA offseason, when most teams are now fairly set with their core players: the combination of  young players and veterans, that they hope will lead to a ring (or at least the playoffs). The balance is important, particularly given the booming salary cap and the appeal of talent that comes attached to a cheap or league-minimum salary. But for every good, young player on a roster there’s one who was drafted in the lottery and ended up a complete bust. Here are the five biggest draft busts of the last 10 years in the NBA.

<h2>Bonus: Joel Embiid</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661269" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661269" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joel-Embiid-Mitchell-Leff-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joel Embiid talks to his teammates before a game." width="757" height="576" /> Joel Embiid (R) warms up and is ready to go | Mitchell Leff/Getty Images[/caption]

It's hard to include a guy who didn't play a single game the year the 76ers chose him. So we give you a bonus section for Joel Embiid (who is far and away the best thing about the 76ers right now). The Philadelphia 76ers drafted the big man third overall in 2014, after Andrew Wiggins and Jabari Parker were already off the board. There were concerns with foot injuries that could cause him to miss his entire rookie season, and eventually he wound up missing two entire years on the court.

But there’s no telling how <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-chance-win-nba-rookie-year.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good he may end up being</a>. NBA big men with foot problems, especially this early in their career, tend to not be headed toward stardom. But you can’t totally blame the 76ers for grabbing the talented Embiid, if for no other reason than the fact that there were really no other obvious future stars available. Julius Randle went No. 7 overall, Rodney Hood went No. 23, and Jordan Clarkson No. 46.

<h2>5. Thomas Robinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661269" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661269" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Thomas-Robinson-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joel Embiid talks to his teammates before a game." width="757" height="576" /> Thomas Robinson kneels on the court. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Twenty-one-year-old Thomas Robinson was once a promising power forward with serious skills around the basket. He was so talented that the Sacramento Kings took him fifth overall in the 2012 draft, ahead of Damian Lillard, Harrison Barnes, Andre Drummond, and Draymond Green. But Sacramento figured something out early, as they traded Robinson just a few months into his rookie season in a three-way deal to the Houston Rockets.

His career never really took off with Houston. Now at just 24 years old he’s playing with the Brooklyn Nets -- his fifth team since coming into the league. Robinson has put up career averages of 13.8 minutes, 4.9 points, and 4.8 rebounds per game while starting just a grand total of 11 of his 265 career NBA games.

Robinson might end up with some longevity, as teams are always looking for forwards with big bodies and scoring abilities. But his draft status and the success of the players taken after him will always label Robinson as one of the biggest draft busts of the current era.

<h2>4. Evan Turner</h2>
[caption id="attachment_699442" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-699442" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Evan-Turner-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Evan Turner of the Portland Trail Blazers speaks to members of AS Roma during a friendly match against the Boston Bolts." width="757" height="504" /> Evan Turner of the Portland Trail Blazers speaks to members of AS Roma. | Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

A lot of questions surrounded Ohio State small forward Evan Turner when he went pro in 2012, mainly regarding the fact that his game was not well-suited for the NBA. He wasn’t quick enough to be the kind of player who slashed to the basket, but didn’t shoot well enough to score consistently from outside. But the 76ers shot for a home run in picking him second overall, hoping those skills would develop and eventually he’d become big-time scorer.

It hasn’t happened. Turner has not developed into someone with an ability to shoot three-pointers, hitting just 30.5% in his career. Being able to shoot from a distance is almost a necessity in the modern NBA, which makes the pick even worse in retrospect. Philadelphia could’ve taken DeMarcus Cousins, Greg Monroe, Paul George, or Gordon Hayward instead; all of these players have developed into better contributors than Turner.

But, of course, all of that doesn’t mean Turner can’t <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-intriguing-and-underrated-2016-free-agents.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have a successful career</a>. He’s averaged 10.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists and has built a niche as a player you can bring off the bench for some points -- however inefficient he might be in getting them. However, Turner’s inability to translate his game to the NBA level, combined with his draft status, make him one of the biggest draft busts of the last 10 years.

<h2>3. Anthony Bennett</h2>
<img class="wp-image-636762" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Anthony-Bennett-UNLV-NBA.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Anthony Bennett is somewhat of a forgotten name around the NBA. He was one of several No. 1 overall picks that the Cleveland Cavaliers landed in the wake of LeBron James leaving town for Miami. Unfortunately, Bennett's career has never really gotten off the ground.

Bennett <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-players-who-should-have-just-stayed-in-college.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had a disappointing rookie year</a> with Cleveland, averaging 4.2 points in 12.8 minutes per game as a 20-year-old, and only playing 52 games. James made his decision to return home that offseason, prompting the Cavs to purge the young players off their roster. This sent Bennett in a package to Minnesota for Kevin Love. Bennett played one season with the Timberwolves, showing little improvement, and the team actually released him that summer.

The Brooklyn gave Bennett a chance last season, but he spent the majority of the year bouncing between Toronto and the D-League until they eventually waived him. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets, then he eventually moved to a pro team in Turkey, Turkish Basketbol Süper Ligi. That team recently cut him, and he faces an unknown future.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Greg Oden</h2>
<img class="wp-image-699468" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Greg-Oden-Christian-Peterson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Greg Oden is a sad story. When he was in college at Ohio State, people joked that the 19-year-old looked like he was already 40. Little did they know that his knees resembled those of a 60-year-old. The Portland Trail Blazers took Oden first overall in the 2007 draft. But he couldn't play his rookie year due to chronic knee problems. He debuted the following year, with a solid first year averaging 8.9 points and 7.0 rebounds in 61 games.

But he only played 21 games the following year, and then had to sit out three entire seasons due to his many knee surgeries. Oden attempted an NBA comeback at the age of 26, playing in 23 games in 2013<span class="s1">–</span>14 for the Miami Heat -- and nearly earning a championship ring out of it -- before losing in the NBA finals against the San Antonio Spurs. Oden didn’t return the following year, and despite rumors that he’d <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/06/21/greg-oden-comeback-nba-team-workouts">like to attempt another comeback</a>, he has never had another team give him a shot.

Kevin Durant was taken second in the draft Oden's year, and Al Horford, Mike Conley, Joakim Noah, and Thaddeus Young all went in the top 12. To make matters worse, if Portland had been so intent on getting a low-post presence in the 2007 draft, they could have simply waited and taken Marc Gasol with the 42nd pick instead of guard Derrick Byars.

<h2>1. Hasheem Thabeet</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640521" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640521" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Hasheem-Thabeet-of-the-Oklahoma-City-Thunder.jpg" alt="Hasheem Thabeet of the Oklahoma City Thunder scores under pressure from Wesley Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers." width="757" height="456" /> Hasheem Thabeet of the Oklahoma City Thunder scores under pressure from Wesley Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers | AFP Photo/Frederic J. Brown[/caption]

Even some of the most hardcore NBA fans won't recognize the name Hasheem Thabeet, aka the ultimate draft bust of the last decade. When Blake Griffin went first overall to the Los Angeles Clippers, the Memphis Grizzlies were on the clock and looking for a player who would help them return to the playoffs.

Despite the presence of Gasol, who had averaged 11.9 points and 7.5 rebounds as a 24-year-old the season prior, the Grizzlies decided to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-the-worst-second-overall-picks-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draft 7-foot-3 Thabeet</a> instead of any number of quality future NBA players, such as James Harden, Ricky Rubio, and two-time league MVP Stephen Curry. Thabeet’s best season came in his rookie year, when he played in 68 games and averaged 3.1 points in 3.6 rebounds per game.

The Grizzlies traded Thabeet to the Houston Rockets for Shane Battier, and then he later moved to Portland Trail Blazers for Marcus Camby. He signed a free-agent deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2012, but still struggled to put together a career worthy of a back-up center in the NBA. Thabeet was later traded to the 76ers, released, signed by the Pistons, and released yet again just prior to the 2014<span class="s1">–</span>15 season.

		<description><![CDATA[Beyond simply putting the ball in the hoop, the greatest NBA shooting guards are all-around players who can control the action in all phases of the game.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The shooting guard’s primary responsibility has historically been to score the basketball. In some cases, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-how-modern-shooting-guards-have-evolved.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the shooting guard is the offense</a>, because he is able to put the ball on the floor, break down the defense, and create his own shot at will. Beyond simply putting the ball in the hoop, the greatest all-around players can control the action in all phases of the game.

At any time, the all-time great shooting guards could just kick it into that extra gear and slap together staggering triple-double stat lines. At home, these showmen delight crowds with slick ball-handling, silky-smooth jump shooting, and no-look passes in transition. On the road, the best shooting guards transformed into the ultimate villains; they demanded the basketball to run rough-shod over the competition, shut up the home crowd, and seal victories with clutch-time free throws. Here are 10 of the greatest shooting guards seen in the NBA.
<h2>10. Ray Allen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695924" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-695924" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145777952.jpg" alt="Ray Allen pumps his fist after scoring." width="756" height="504" /> Ray Allen pumps his fist after scoring | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Ray Allen is getting the slight nod over Reggie Miller as an all-time great. As scorers, Allen and Miller will always be compared to each other. Both wing scorers shared deft shooting touch, superb conditioning, and vintage off-the-ball movement. Miller, however, could never get past Michael Jordan.

Allen, with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_career.html">2,973 three-point field goals to his credit</a>, has two championship rings — as a Boston Celtic and as a veteran Miami Heat role player. As a gentleman out on the floor, Allen never flashed the choke sign or traded barbs with Spike Lee beneath the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. Allen, instead, was simply all business in Milwaukee, Seattle, Boston, and Miami — to the tune of a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allenra02.html">19-point per game career scoring average</a> over 19 years in the league.

<h2>9. Earl “The Pearl” Monroe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695928" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695928" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/52617406.jpg" alt="Earl Monroe coaches some young basketball players." width="757" height="493" /> Earl Monroe coaches some young basketball players | Brad Barket/Getty Images[/caption]

Apparently Earl Monroe came out the womb ready to drop 40. A pure scorer, The Pearl went from Philadelphia schoolboy legend to dominate the league with his flamboyant style. In between stops, Monroe managed to average <a href="http://nbahoopsonline.com/Articles/top160/040EMonroe.html">42 points point per game</a> as a senior at Winston Salem State. Monroe took his high-octane act to the professional ranks as the second overall pick in the 1967 draft for the Baltimore Bullets. In 1971, Monroe was shipped up north where he teamed up with Walt “Clyde” Frazier to own New York and take home a 1973 NBA Championship.

Over a thirteen-year career, Monroe made it look easy as he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/monroea01.html">19 points per game as a professional</a>. Monroe was a silky smooth scorer, who would pin the defense on his back with a spin move before dropping a floater into the net.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Pete “Pistol Pete” Maravich</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695994" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-695994" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pistol-pete-maravich-377x500.jpg" alt="Pistol Pete Maravich graces the cover of Sports Illustrated." width="500" height="663" /> Pistol Pete Maravich graces the cover of Sports Illustrated | Source: Petemaravich.com[/caption]

Pistol Pete Maravich was one of the most unique athletes to ever don a pair of basketball shorts. From his days at LSU and into the NBA, Maravich electrified crowds with his scoring ability, showmanship, and slick ball-handling. In the 1970s, Pete Maravich helped introduce a street ball style to the professional ranks. Vintage Pistol Pete would don his sloppy socks, receive an outlet pass in the backcourt, cross over between his legs, and go behind the back before raising up for a clutch jumper on the wing. Maravich could and would fill it up.

Over the course of eleven seasons, Maravich shredded defenses for his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maravpe01.html">24-point, 4-rebound, and 5-assist per game averages</a>. In his best season, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1977.html">Maravich led the 1976-1977 NBA in scoring</a> — with 31 points per game. To boot, the Pistol also averaged five rebounds and assists per game that season for the New Orleans Jazz.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Clyde Drexler</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695951" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695951" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51641727.jpg" alt="Clyde Drexler lunges for the ball against the Lakers." width="757" height="548" /> Clyde Drexler lunges for the ball against the Lakers | Hector Mata/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Clyde “The Glide” Drexler was a raw athlete. Because of his explosive first step and other worldly leaping ability, Drexler could get by on a jump shot that may have been described as serviceable, at best. Drexler electrified Portland crowds with his end-to-end high-wire act. A founding member of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6g-DVKnsw">Phi Slama Jama</a>, The Glide was well known for his ability to throw down a thunderous tomahawk jam, and swing the momentum of an entire ball game.

As a Trailblazer, Drexler averaged more than 25 points per game during three separate seasons and made two trips to the 1990 and 1992 NBA Finals. In the finals, Drexler’s Blazers were stopped short by the likes of Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan. Via trade, Drexler was to return back to Houston and again team up Hakeem Olajuwon to win the <a href="http://www.thedreamshake.com/2012/8/22/3259421/what-is-the-rockets-best-trade-ever">1995 NBA Finals.</a> Critics, however, might suggest that this championship was deserving of an asterisk: Jordan was out of basketball that season.

<h2>6. John Havlicek</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695944" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-695944" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/73733885-640x452.jpg" alt="John Havlicek and friends at a TaylorMade event." width="756" height="534" /> John Havlicek and friends at a TaylorMade event | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

In true Boston Celtic form, John Havlicek (left, above) was an overachiever, whose overall game was greater than the collective sum of its parts. Largely playing beneath the rim, Havlicek earned his spot as the all-time scoring leader for the Celtics through grit, hustle, and determination. Hondo did not necessarily beat defenders through raw athleticism and rim-rocking jams. Instead, Havlicek wore the opposition down through conditioning and would run his man into the ground down the stretch into the fourth quarter on both ends of the floor. A model of consistency, he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/havlijo01.html">21 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists per game</a> after putting in sixteen years of service at the NBA level. <a href="http://www.johnhavlicekbasketball.com/boston-celtics-nba/8-championships/">Hondo claimed eight championships</a> with the Celtics dynasty that included Red Auerbach, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Sam Jones.

<h2>5. Allen Iverson</h2>

Pound-for-pound, Allen Iverson was the toughest man to ever play basketball. Standing 6-foot and weighing in at a svelte 165, Iverson had no regard for his own body. The relentless A.I. remained locked into attack mode from the opening tip. Love him or hate him, no reasonable NBA fan could question Iverson’s tenacity, aggressiveness, and overall swagger. In terms of stats, Iverson reigned as the <a href="http://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Records/stats/scoring.html">NBA’s scoring champion</a> on four separate occasions and finished up his NBA career with a 27-point per game average. Beyond the stats, cornrows, tattoos, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI">“we talkin’ bout practice”</a> rant, A.I. will forever be immortalized through his 1997 encounter with Michael Jordan. In Philadelphia, Iverson took on Jordan at the top of the 3-point circle. Controlling the ball, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJMi5lvQqq8">A.I. crossed up Michael</a> with his patented left-to-right D.C. Crossover shimmy, before lighting up Jordan with a foul line jump shot.

<h2>4. George Gervin</h2>

As cool as the other side of the pillow, George Gervin knew how to score the basketball. Seemingly at will, Gervin (right, above) could get hot from the outside, post up, and drive the lane. To finish, Gervin would elevate and finger-roll the ball into the hoop, over the outstretched arms of opposing big men time and time again. Working the perimeter in the ABA and the NBA, the Ice Man <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gervige01.html">averaged 25 points per game</a> as a professional basketball player between 1972 and 1986. No. 44, of course, did most of his damage in San Antonio, where he led the NBA in scoring four out of the five seasons from 1978 to 1982. In his best (1979-1980) season, Gervin torched the opposition for 33 points per game.

<h2>3. Jerry West</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695963" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-695963" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/162304232.jpg" alt="Jerry West addresses the audience at an NBA event." width="756" height="503" /> Jerry West addresses the audience at an NBA event | Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

The Jerry West silhouette ultimately emerged as the NBA Logo. As testimony to his all-around play, West <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westje01.html">averaged 27 points, 6 rebounds, and 7 assists per game</a> throughout his fourteen-year NBA career. With this stat line, Mr. West proved that he was equally adept as a playmaker as he was as a scorer. In 1972, Jerry West actually led the league in assists (9.7 APG) — to go alongside his 26 points per game average. In the NBA Playoffs, West earned his Clutch moniker, despite the fact that he lost eight out of his nine bridesmaid trips to the Finals.

West holds the record for playoff series scoring average — with an unreal 46 points per game in five match-ups versus the 1965 Baltimore Bullets. Also of note, West took home the <a href="http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/04/the-25-most-badass-playoff-performances-in-nba-history/jerry-west-wins-finals-mvp-in-losing-effort">1969 Finals MVP trophy</a>, despite losing the series to the Boston Celtics. In the clinching Game 7 defeat, West dominated all aspects of the game, in compiling 42 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists. Thwarted by the Boston juggernaut yet again, West would not taste NBA Championship victory until he teamed up with Wilt Chamberlain to beat the 1972 Knicks. Upon his playing retirement, West easily transitioned into one of the league’s most formidable executives. As Lakers general manager, West engineered a <a href="http://www.lakersnation.com/throwback-thursday-lakers-trade-for-kobe-bryant-on-draft-day-1996/2013/11/28/">1996 draft day trade</a> to bring Kobe Bryant to Los Angeles.

<h2>2. Kobe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673927" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-673927" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Kobe-Bryant-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant speaks to the press during a media conference." width="756" height="611" /> Kobe Bryant speaks to the press during a media conference | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Kobe Bryant is that rare athlete whose career arc has actually exceeded the obscene hype that preceded his first professional warm-up session. As a young pup fresh out of high school in 1996, Bryant quickly established himself as a dangerous slasher to the goal and the next big thing. Like any great, Bryant improved each year as he worked tirelessly on his game each summer to add to his bag of tricks: turnaround jumper, crossover dribble, and the Hakeem Dream Shake. Both off and on the court, Bryant has gone full circle from wunderkind to despised brat to cagey veteran.

Within three short years, Bryant was hands down the most talented player in the league and began to chase championship hardware as Robin to Shaquille O’Neal’s Batman. The two, of course, could not co-exist as Bryant apparently grew to resent his role as second banana. It was only a matter of time Shaq was shipped out of town, as Lakers management decided to build the franchise around the younger Bryant. The highs and lows of Bryant’s young career already included a <a href="http://www.nba.com/2013/history/05/17/2002-los-angeles-lakers-three-peat/">2000-2002 championship three-peat</a>, embarrassing NBA Finals shellacking at the hands of the 2004 Detroit Pistons, and one notorious Colorado trial.

To silence the critics, Bryant simply put in work. Bryant’s approach to the game has become more cerebral as his body has lost explosiveness to injuries and age. In half-court sets, Bryant can play the angles to knock down open shots, pin overmatched guards on his back, and slip gracefully into the lane. He finished his storied career having won five NBA Championships.

<h2>1. Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674007" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674007" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Michael-Jordan-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan walks off the court after a win." width="757" height="497" /> Michael Jordan walks off the court after a win | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Jordan was unquestionably the most competitive athlete to ever step out on to the hardwood. To go with his athleticism and work ethic, Michael took pleasure in ripping out the collective heart of his opposition at mid-court. For motivation, Jordan would often play up perceived slights to go ballistic and drop 50 to close out games. The tongue wagging and aerial acrobatics came out in full force with Michael in the zone. Jordan would demand the basketball and go on the attack to torch all comers out on the floor. <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/jordan63_moments.html">Even Larry Legend compared Michael to God</a>. Apparently, mere mortals could never hope to contain Jordan, who performed with no apparent weakness to his game.

Jordan drives the lane. Jordan spots up and hits the three. Jordan posts up and connects on the fade away. Jordan steals the basketball and feeds Pippen in transition for the jam. After 40 minutes of action, Jordan is well on his way to another victory, NBA Championship, epic performance, and title as the all time greatest to ever lace up a pair of Nike Air Jordan sneakers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkY7W6kCRY4">It’s gotta be the shoes.</a>

		<description><![CDATA[Even when they're destined for the lottery, the Los Angeles Lakers' historic franchise remains a vital force in NBA history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Los Angeles Lakers, even when losing, is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-franchises-kobe-bryant-tortured-the-most.html/">most glamorous franchise</a> in all of sports. In Southern California, Laker games at the Forum and Staples Center are always a “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-teams-with-the-most-loyal-fan-bases.html/">see and be seen</a>” event for Hollywood celebrities, wealthy businessmen, and high-powered bureaucrats. For years, the product out on the floor featured dominant big men, graceful wing players, and of course, savvy coaching and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/stocks/11-leadership-lessons-from-coach-phil-jackson.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">motivational tactics</a> from the likes of leading men Pat Riley and Phil Jackson.
<h2>1. Magic Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785869" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785869 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Magic-Johnson-Byron-Scott-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="544" /> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

At 6-foot-9, Earvin “Magic” Johnson was the rare NBA athlete who could play all five positions at a high level, most notably when he subbed in for Kareem Abdul-Jabaar at center, in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals as a 20-year-old rookie. That evening, Johnson went on to rack up 42 points, 15 rebounds, and 7 assists, a performance that helped him claim Finals MVP honors in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.

Magic’s true gift arrived when assistant coach Pat Riley was promoted to the head coach position. All of a sudden, Showtime was born, with Magic as the ringleader — a one-man fast break who could crash the boards, control the basketball in the open floor, and push the pace. At times, Johnson appeared to defy the laws of physics, in feeding the likes of Byron Scott, James Worthy, and A.C. Green for easy dunks and lay-ins off pinpoint no-look passes..

Magic Johnson’s megawatt smile and Hollywood marquee showmanship made for the perfect contrast against the scrappy Larry Bird and his Boston Celtics. In all, Magic closed out his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html">13-year career</a> having averaged, 20 points, 11 assists, and 7 rebounds per game and finished with five championships to his credit, too.

<h2>2. Kobe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_724095" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-724095" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/92614249-e1415808594471.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="665" /> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

For better or for worse, Kobe Bryant is the closest thing that the game has seen to Michael Jordan since His Airness. In 1996, fellow Laker legend Jerry West brought Kobe to Southern California out of high school via a draft-day deal with the Charlotte Hornets. As a raw athlete, a young Kobe Bryant put his time in on the bench behind Eddie Jones and saw limited action, usually put into the game to provide instant offense.

Over time, Kobe improved his outside shooting touch, while also adding a turnaround jumper, and post-up game to his arsenal. By his fifth year in the league, Bryant <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was torching defenses </a>for 29 points, while also hauling in 6 rebounds and dishing out 5 assists per game. Kobe’s development as a player set up a power struggle between himself and Shaquille O’Neal. (LA acquired Shaq in free agency the same year they drafted Kobe).

While Shaq and Kobe did bring home three straight championships from 2000 through 2002, they were humiliated by the Detroit in 2004, losing the NBA Finals in just five games. The loss to the cohesive, team-oriented Pistons exacerbated the already deteriorating relationship between the two Tinseltown stars – a fissure that ultimately saw Shaq leave for the Miami Heat.

From there, Kobe, now the unquestioned leader of the franchise, floundered with the rest of the Lakers for a little while (including a season that saw him score 81 points in a single game on a team that was bounced in the first round of the playoffs) before winning two more rings in 2009 and 2010. In all, Bryant has averaged 25 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, over the course of 19 seasons, although he has been slowed by injuries in recent times.

<h2>3. Jerry West</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785940" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785940 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jerry-West-Todd-Warshaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="502" /> Todd Warshaw/Getty Images[/caption]

For the ultimate statement on Jerry West’s impact upon the game, look no further than the NBA logo: a silhouette of West driving baseline. As a result of his timeless all-around play, West put up 27 points, 7 assists, and 6 rebounds per game, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westje01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the course of his 14-year career</a>. In 1971, The Logo slid over to point guard, where he led the league in assists with nearly 10 dimes each contest, while also dropping in 26 points per game.

A leading playmaker, West earned the nickname “Mr. Clutch,” despite losing eight out of nine trips to the NBA Finals. In his prime, Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics repeatedly turned him back at the championship altar, but not for a lack of trying. West remains the only player to receive Finals MVP recognition on a losing team.

During the 1965 Western Division Finals, West torched the Baltimore Bullets for a record 46 points per game through the six-game series. Mr. Clutch took home the 1969 Finals MVP honors, after racking up 38 points, seven assists, and five rebounds per game against the Celtics. West and the Lakers, however, actually lost this series to the Celtics in seven games. In a Game 7 defeat, West dominated at both ends of the floor, for 42 points, 12 assists, and 13 rebounds.

Throughout the twilight of his career, Jerry West joined forces with Hall of Famers Gail Goodrich, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain to go 69-13 through the 1971-1972 regular season. In the ’72 Finals, West paced the Lakers with 20 points, 4 rebounds, and 9 assists per game, to finally win his one and only championship against the New York Knicks.

<h2>4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785964 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kareem-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Lew Alcindor was the original building block for John Wooden’s UCLA Dynasty that won 88 consecutive games. For his part, Alcindor averaged 26 points and 16 boards per game, winning three championships in <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/kareem-abdul-jabbar-1.html">three years</a> at Westwood. In the NBA, Alcindor won one title with Oscar Robertson and the Bucks in 1971. Then, he converted to Islam, changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and left Milwaukee for the bright lights of LA.

Abdul-Jabbar joined forces with fellow Laker, Magic Johnson, as one of the more formidable inside-out combinations in the history of basketball. In all, the pair won five championships (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988<span class="s1">).</span> Magic ultimately assumed control of the team from the elder statesman Kareem.

As an unstoppable force, Abdul-Jabbar would clear out space on the low block. After receiving a post-entry pass from Magic, Kareem would pound the ball for two dribbles, before rising up and dropping in his famed sky-hook shot into the bottom of the net. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is still the all-time <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html">NBA scoring leader</a> – with 38,387 total points.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Shaquille O’Neal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785995" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785995 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Shaq-Vince-Bucci-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="638" /> Vice Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Shaquille O’Neal was the latest in a long line of dominant Laker big men, which included the likes of George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (no apologies to Dwight Howard, who probably wouldn’t want to be counted anyway).

As a force, Shaq was a man among boys in LA, who simply bowled over the competition to have his way in the paint. After establishing position in the deep post, O’Neal would take one quick drop step, before powering toward the goal for hammer dunks. After mauling double and even triple teams, opposing defenses would often resort to “Hack a Shaq,” defenses, to put the 53% career free throw shooter on the line, and hope for one miss.

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html">In eight seasons</a> as a Laker, Shaquille O’Neal averaged 27 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2.5 blocks per game, over the course of 8 seasons. In 1999, Shaq took home MVP honors, leading the NBA in scoring with 30 points per game while also hauling in 14 boards and dishing out 4 assists per contest. He also claimed three consecutive Finals MVP awards, in bringing three straight titles to the Lakers during their 2000-2002 threepeat.

One condition of a proper basketball game: There must <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-greatest-scoring-games-by-a-single-player-in-nba-history.html/">be a winner</a> when the final buzzer blares. Otherwise it’s just a practice or a shoot-around, right? There is always a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-scoring-nba-games-history.html/">clear winner</a> and clear loser -- even in the tightest games. Of course, every once in a while, the scoreboard in an NBA tilt is a little lopsided.

During March 2014, for example, the Los Angeles Clippers ran all over their more-famous Staples Center cohabitants, the Los Angeles Lakers, 142-94. The <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/06/sports/la-sp-ln-lakers-vs-clippers-game-updates-20140306">48-point loss</a>, while taking the top spot as the worst in Lakers franchise history, barely scratches the surface of the biggest blowouts in the NBA history books. Backed by the invaluable data and search tools provided by <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basketball-Reference</a>, here are the nine biggest smackdowns in NBA history.

<h2>9. The Milwaukee Bucks dispatch the Sacramento Kings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_772828" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-772828" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Terry-Cummings-Milwaukee-Bucks.jpg" alt="Terry Cummings of the Milwaukee Bucks stands on the court." width="500" height="754" /> Terry Cummings of the Milwaukee Bucks stands on the court. | Allsport USA/AllSport[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: December 15, 1985

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 140-82

Sacramento has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-franchises-longest-title-droughts.html/">suffered</a> some wicked smackdowns in its history. This beatdown at the hands of Milwaukee is one of the worst, ranking as the second-greatest point deficit the team has ever suffered.

The ’85 Bucks, lead by Terry Cummings, Paul Pressey, and Sidney Moncrief, couldn’t miss. Well, except for Moncrief, who went 0-3 from the field (but salvaged it by going 6-6 from the line). As a team, the Bucks shot a blistering 66% from the floor. That’s two out of every three shots. The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198512150MIL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">box score</a> breaks it down this way: 36 points in the first quarter, 28 points in the second, a 42-point explosion in the third quarter, and a final 34 points before the buzzer. Boom: 140 points. And no one, excluding Cummings, shot the ball more than 15 times. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. The Sacramento Kings trump the Dallas Mavericks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_772825" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-772825" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Dallas-Mavericks-Derek-Harper.jpg" alt="Dallas Mavericks guard Derek Harper dribbles the ball up-court during a game against the Denver Nuggets." width="500" height="800" /> Dallas Mavericks guard Derek Harper dribbles the ball up-court. | Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: December 29, 1992

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 139-81

Luckily for the Kings, they appear on the other end of this list as well, dropping a 58-point bomb on the hapless Ross Perot Jr.-era <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-and-worst-fanbases-in-the-nba.html/">Dallas Mavericks</a>. Technically, this game is tied with the Bucks/Kings game as far as final score goes. However, this one gets the nod because the Mavs scored even fewer points in their quest toward futility.

The craziest thing about this game is that the Kings only took 12 more shots than Dallas. That’s four more shots a quarter -- hardly the exorbitant difference you expect from a final score like that one. They also only shot 51% from the field as a squad. The real boost over Dallas came from Hall of Famer Mitch Richmond, who put up 22 points and shot 8-11 from the field. His career might have been paved with losing seasons but damn, Richmond was good at basketball.

<h2>7. The Golden State Warriors outrun the Indiana Pacers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_772823" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-772823" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Klay-Thompson-Rick-Barry-Golden-State-Warriors.jpg" alt="Klay Thompson #11 of the Golden State Warriors is presented the Western Conference Championship Trophy by former NBA player Rick Barry after defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game Seven of the Western Conference Finals during the 2016 NBA Playoffs at ORACLE Arena on May 30, 2016 in Oakland, California. | Pool/Getty Images" width="757" height="502" /> Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors is presented the Western Conference Championship Trophy by former NBA player Rick Barry. | Pool/Getty Images[/caption]

Date: March 19, 1977

Final score: 150-91

Understatement: Rick Barry <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-small-forwards-of-all-time.html/">was really good</a> at scoring points. So, of course it was Barry, with 28 points on 13 shots, who led the Dubs in a game that saw all but two players, reserve guards Phil Smith and Gus Williams, break double digits. Interestingly enough, this was years before the NBA adopted the three-point line.

Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197703190GSW.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">box score</a> doesn’t get much more specific than that. Plus, there doesn’t seem to be much footage of the ’77 Warriors explicitly. There<em> is</em> this video of Barry going off for 38 points in 1975. As the roster was almost the same as the ’77 squad, it’s well worth watching. It is extra worth your time because Barry shoots his free throws underhanded. He’s famous for it and all, but it still looks ridiculous. There’s one at the one-minute mark. And it goes in.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: December 26, 1978

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 143-84

How much do you know about Ernie Grunfeld? You probably know him as the guy who drafted John Wall. Or, possibly, the guy who helped the Knicks be competitive as their GM from 1986<span class="s1">–</span>99.  Or the guy who shifted over to the Milwaukee and then Washington, when James Dolan controversially kicked him to the curb in favor of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/">Isiah Thomas</a>.

You might not know that, during his playing days, Grunfeld was one of the Milwaukee Bucks responsible for this one-sided performance. Contributing 27 points, he was one of three Bucks to finish with 20-plus in that tilt.

Drafted 11th overall in the ’77 NBA Draft, Grunfeld stuck with Milwaukee for two years before joining the Knicks, where he reunited with his college teammate, Bernard King <span class="s1">-- </span>a friendship that’s received significantly more press than this game. What if we told you that ESPN <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-best-espns-30-for-30-documentaries-ever.html/">made a <em>30-for-30</em></a> about their friendship?

<h2>5. The Knicks lose big on Christmas to the Syracuse Nationals</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FkD4GRGdCZI"></iframe>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: December 25, 1960

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 162-100

Before becoming the 76ers and moving to Philly to fill the void left by the Warriors, the Syracuse Nationals visited the 1954 NBA Finals, ultimately losing to the Minneapolis Lakers. (Yes, NBA teams used to move around a lot.) The Nationals also joined in on what has become a league-wide pastime: beating up on the Knicks.

Finishing with a 62-point margin of victory, the Nat scored like maniacs that Christmas day, racking up a pair of 39-point quarters in the first half and finishing with back-to-back 42 pointers. The box score for the game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196012250SYR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is lacking</a>. However, Hal Greer, Dolph Schayes, and Dave Gambee went to town; each finished with more than 20 points.

In celebration of the dearly departed Syracuse Nationals, here’s some footage of that finals battle against the Lakers, who had the legendary George Mikan on their roster. It’s in black and white <span class="s1">-- a </span>classic.<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left">4. Run T and C lead the Golden State Warriors over the Sacramento Kings</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JKAMIQOrIDU"></iframe>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: November 2, 1991</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 153-91</p>
A day that will live in infamy. That morning, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-a-pro-sports-team-rebuild-actually-worked.html/">Golden State Warriors</a>' front office announced that Richmond, the middle member of the high-scoring, high-octane Run TMC Warriors squad (see video for Run TMC highlights<span class="s1">)</span>, had been traded to the Sacramento Kings for No. 3 draft pick Billy Owens. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-02/sports/sp-478_1_billy-owens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Don Nelson</a>, then coach and GM of the Warriors: “The decision to trade Mitch Richmond is the toughest I have ever made.”

With Richmond held out of the game that night, he was unable to help his new team avoid the 62-point rout. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-6-greatest-golden-state-warriors-of-all-time.html/">Chris Mullin</a>, in particular, went off, hitting 15-22 from the field and leading his team to a 57% field goal percentage overall.

While this victory probably put some pep in the Warriors’ belief in their decision, trading Richmond ushered in a dark cloud that didn't lift from over the Dubs for over a decade. Owens played for six different teams from 1992<span class="s1">–</span>2001, while Richmond was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2014.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: March 19, 1972

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 162-99

On their way to winning their first title since coming to Los Angeles from Minnesota, the Lakers put together the biggest win streak the NBA has ever seen. With new coach Bill Sharman, new captain Wilt Chamberlain, and Jerry West taking over the point guard spot as the primary ball handler, the ’72 Lakers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">were a force</a> to be reckoned with.

The Lakers laid the smackdown on the Warriors, who had Nate Thurmond and not much else. LA scored more than 40 points in all but one quarter of play. Eight of the Lakers (including Wilt, West, Happy Hairston and the inspiration for Gordon Gekko, Pat Riley) finishing in double figures.

The 17,505 fans who made the journey out to see the Lakers defend their home court were certainly rewarded with a magnificent game. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197203190LAL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">box scores of the time</a> make it hard to describe much of anything else about the game, especially with the scarcity of footage from the halcyon days of the ’70s NBA.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Indiana Pacers put the Portland Trail Blazers solidly in the loss column</h2>
[caption id="attachment_772826" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-772826" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-648330758.jpg" alt="Head coach Damon Stoudamire of the Pacific Tigers reacts during a game against the Gonzaga Bulldogs." width="757" height="527" /> Head coach Damon Stoudamire of the Pacific Tigers reacts during a game against the Gonzaga Bulldogs. | Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: February 2, 1998

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 124-59

59 points? How does a smackdown like that happen? Because this is how the Blazer's box score broke down by quarter: 14-15-14-16. That’s awful. Now, with a team featuring Damon Stoudamire, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-completely-changed-game.html/">Rasheed Wallace</a>, and Isaiah Rider, expectations weren't terribly high. (‘Sheed aside, none of those dudes were amazing defenders.) But, <em>59 points</em>?

Looking at the box score, it becomes a little more obvious. Portland couldn’t hit the broad side of a barn, going 24-72. A quarter of those baskets were <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/">from Wallace</a>, who went 6-10. Take him out, and you’re left with a truly wretched 14-62, 22% shooting from the floor. Gross.

The Pacers, meanwhile, did the opposite. Sporting a team with Mark Jackson, Chris Mullin, and Jalen Rose, they managed to go 49-77 from the field, a 63% clip that should rightly be associated with good shooting. Maybe the Blazers should’ve traded for one of the Pacers at halftime.<!--nextpage-->

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: December 17, 1991

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: 148-80

Through years of misery and bad sports karma, the Cavs secretly held on to the NBA’s biggest victory for over two decades. And, what’s better, given the recent history of the franchises, that they experienced this margin against the Miami Heat. Long before LeBron, the Cavaliers were led by Craig Ehlo, Winston Bennett, Brad Daugherty, and John "Hot Rod" Williams.

They held the Heat to a putrid 35% shooting percentage from the floor and managed to outscore Miami’s second half total (27 points) in every single quarter, going 34-39-33-42 to Miami’s 24-29-13-14. The Cavs shot 57% from the field.

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a look at 5 current NBA players who have the athletic ability to play football in the NFL.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_722147" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722147 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jimmy-Graham-Dunk.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="555" /> Sean Gardner/Getty Images[/caption]

The list of college basketball players with limited football experience taking their athletic talents to the football gridiron seems to grow every year. It started with Tony Gonzalez, who was a two-sport star in college, and has continued with current All-Pro caliber tight ends Antonio Gates, Jimmy Graham, and Julius Thomas.

When an avid football fan watches an NBA game, it’s undoubtedly hard for them not to imagine some of the amazing athletes of the NBA in an NFL uniform.<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dunks-in-the-history-of-the-nba-slam-dunk-contest.html/" target="_blank"> Many professional basketball players possess a rare combination of size, speed, agility, and body control</a> that is, for lack of a better word, freakish. Recently, former University of Miami basketball player Erik Swoope decided to hang up his high tops, lace up a pair of cleats, and attempted to reinvent himself as a tight end in the NFL, and NBA staple Nate Robinson has made  waves by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-nba-free-agent-nate-robinson-intends-to-try-out-nfl-20160311-story.html" target="_blank">saying he'll try out for any NFL teams this offseason</a>. Here, then, is a look at five NBA players who could make the transition to playing in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Glen Davis, power forward, free agent</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722148" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722148 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Glen-Davis.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="861" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 9 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 290 pounds</li>
</ul>
Through nine NBA seasons, Glen Davis averaged a modest 8.7 points and 4.7 rebounds for his career. Had Davis chosen the football route when he was a blue-chip recruit in both football and basketball as a high school senior, we could be talking about a perennial All-Pro left offensive tackle instead of a NBA role player. With Davis’s size, strength, body control, length, and agility, he could easily neutralize the best pass rushers in the NFL today.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>LeBron James, small forward, Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722149" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722149 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LeBron-James.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 8 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 250 pounds</li>
</ul>
LeBron James’s football potential has been in the limelight ever since video of him as a <a title="LeBron James Football Highlights" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX_diVyt2XE" target="_blank">wide receiver in high school</a> went viral a few years back. As probably the most gifted athlete in the NBA in terms overall size, speed, and strength, James could almost surely make a living in the NFL as either a tight end or wide receiver. Imagine a player with Rob Gronkowski’s size and Dez Bryant’s speed and agility. That may be an over-exaggeration, but it’s hard to imagine any defender in the NFL being able to cover King James.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>John Wall, point guard, Washington Wizards</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722150 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/John-Wall.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="487" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 4 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 195 pounds</li>
</ul>
John Wall is arguably the fastest player in the entire NBA, which means the guy can flat-out fly. Throw in the fact that he is 6-foot-4 with long arms and you have the makings of another Randy Moss-type of wide receiver.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Andre Iguodala, shooting guard, Golden State Warriors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722151" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722151 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Andre-Iguodala.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="948" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 6 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 215 pounds</li>
</ul>
Andre Iguodala is athletic enough and big enough to guard four positions in the NBA. He also happens to be one of the most explosive, slashing athletes in the league, as well. He has the body to be either a wide receiver or tight end in the NFL, and a lot like LeBron, there would be very few players currently in the NFL that would have the ability to cover Iguodala on a consistent basis.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>Kenneth Faried, power forward, Denver Nuggets</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_722152" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722152 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Kenneth-Faried.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 8 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 228 pounds</li>
</ul>
Kenneth Faried is an absolute freak of nature. He has the type of size and athletic ability that would translate well to several positions in the NFL. Watching him play basketball, one can’t help but think about what kind of defensive end or linebacker he would make, but you also cannot deny that his speed, length, and leaping ability would come in handy offensively in the red zone. If Faried were to take part in the NFL Combine, even if it was just for fun, he would have scouts and coaches salivating at his football potential.

The NBA "big three" <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-big-threes-in-the-nba-today.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">represents the perfect storm</a> of both sheer luck and savvy front office wheeling and dealing -- to work the draft, negotiate fair contracts, and arrange trades between rival teams. On the floor, each All-Star member of the best big threes will complement the group; they bring a critical skill set to the table. Characteristics may include <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-clutch-nba-players-in-the-game-right-now.html/">clutch outside shooting</a>, low-post scoring, playmaking, or even dirty work to block shots and rebound.

With a big three in place, it's easier to recruit solid role players who can help pursue a title run. If anything, it is the delicate task of managing competitive egos that sometimes undermine the longevity of these groups; each individual player is often asked to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-never-win-championship.html/">subjugate his own game</a> to better the team concept.

The five best big threes in NBA history all managed to stand the test of time and claim multiple championships in what may be lauded as basketball nirvana.

<h2><strong>5. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_516287" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-516287" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LeBron-James-Miami-Heat-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Big Threes of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James (C) and his Miami Heat teammates and personnel | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Prior to the 2010 regular season, LeBron James announced his decision to “<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/ohio-sports-blog/index.ssf/2011/06/lebron_james_not_2_not_3_not_4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take his game to South Beach</a>.” From there, perennial All-Star Chris Bosh quickly followed. A new band of brother formed in Miami, with Dwyane Wade and Heat President Pat Riley apparently pulling all the strings behind the scenes.

In a rockstar-like introduction, a confident James predicted that the Heat would win [not one], but “four, five, six, or maybe even seven championships.” After struggling out of the gate, Miami did make four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals, winning back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013. Miami was especially dangerous in the open court. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-stars-overshadowed-lebron-james.html/">James and Wade</a> took turns <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-best-teammates-of-all-time.html/">harassing the opposition</a> into costly turnovers before making highlight-reel dunks and layups.

In half-court sets, Chris Bosh embraced his role as a versatile “Stretch Four.” He could bang in the paint <em>and</em> knock down jumpers from deep. In 2014, however, the wheels fell off, despite the team making another run to the Finals. An aging, oft-injured Wade missed several games, and clearly lost a step come playoff time.

In the 2014 Finals, the Spurs humiliated the Heat 4-1, after locking down King James, and daring Miami role players to step up. Shortly thereafter, James abandoned ship and returned to Cleveland to form a younger, more spry Big Three with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>4. Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_527462" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527462" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450684012-640x438.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Big Threes of All Time" width="757" height="518" /> Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The ongoing <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-tim-duncans-nba-career.html/">13-year run of Tim Duncan</a>, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili in San Antonio is again, largely, the result of sheer luck in conjunction with the life’s work of GM R.C. Buford to scout international players. In 1997, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-1996-97-spurs-built-an-nba-dynasty.html/">Spurs</a> took Tim Duncan with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-players-in-every-franchises-history.html/">first overall pick</a> and prize of the draft. Duncan, of course, was the ultimate “can’t miss” prospect, after dominating the competition as a four-year out of Wake Forest.

The prior season, the Spurs collapsed to 20-62, when David Robinson played through only six games after battling a back injury and broken left foot. The Spurs also elevated assistant Gregg Popovich to head coach amid this injury ravaged 1996-97 campaign. In 1999, Tim Duncan won his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-best-teams-90s-except-bulls.html/">first out of five championships</a> as part of a Twin Towers lineup that featured himself alongside David Robinson.

From there, the Spurs reengineered their winning lineup on the fly, with an aging Robinson ultimately embracing his role as a rebounder and shot blocker, and both Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker first taking the floor together in 2002. With time, the unlikely trio of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili went on to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">win four championships together</a> (2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014).

At power forward, Tim Duncan emerged as an all-time great for his ability to score in the low post, spot up from mid-range, rebound, and defend. Meanwhile, the San Antonio coaching staff helped Parker develop from a speedy, score-first point guard into a leading floor general who could get others involved while also picking his spots in the offense to either drive, or hit open jumpers.

In Ginobili, the Spurs had the ultimate wild card as a wing scorer who could create his own shots, distribute the basketball, and remain willing to spark instant offense off the bench. This trio, of course, aged quite gracefully, grooming the likes of LaMarcus Aldridge and Kawhi Leonard to take over the franchise.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>3. Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish </strong></h2>

In 1978, Red Auerbach selected Larry Bird with the sixth overall pick in the draft. At the time, Celtics brass were willing to wait one year for Bird to play out his senior year at Indiana State before taking the parquet floor, as they were certain the "Hick from French Lick" would emerge as the savior for a proud franchise that had slid deep into mediocrity.

Two years later, Red was at it again, fleecing the Golden State Warriors prior to the 1980 Draft. After the victory cigar smoke cleared, the Celtics were left with the rights to Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. This big three front-line <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/">made five trips to the NBA Finals</a> between 1981 and 1987.

As a group, Bird, McHale, and Parish won three championships (1981, 1984, and 1986), which included their first year together. Larry Bird, as one of the greatest closers and all-around players in the history of basketball, put up 24-point, 10-rebound, and 7-assist per game averages.

As a sidekick, Kevin McHale was a technician in his torture chamber on the low block for an array of up-and-under, spin, and drop step moves. Lastly, Robert Parish was the rare center who could go to war in the paint and also step back to hit open shots and free throws.

As winners, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-boston-celtics-in-nba-history.html/">Bird, McHale, and Parish</a> were the main links between separate generations of trios in Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tommy Heinsohn, and Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen in Boston. With each big three group, Celtics tradition has called for players to embrace team play and smart basketball fundamentals above raw athletic ability and individual statistics.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>2. Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_558225" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-558225" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Magic-Johnson-ALLSPORT-USA-Allsport-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Big Threes of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers | AllSports USA/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1980, as a 20-year old rookie, Earvin Johnson subbed in for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center during Game 6 of the NBA Finals against Philadelphia. That night, the Magic Man poured in 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists, taking his first championship and Finals MVP honors.

The moment confirmed a changing of the guard, from Dr. J and Kareem to Magic and Bird, as the faces and headline acts of the NBA. By 1981, the Los Angeles Lakers elevated assistant Pat Riley to head coach. That season, Magic and Kareem won their second title together, beating the 76ers again in the Finals. In 1982, the Lakers took James Worthy as the first overall pick out of North Carolina, and Showtime flourished.

As a 6-foot-9 point guard, Magic crashed the boards, controlled the basketball, pushed the pace, and hit Worthy on the wing for transition dunks. In half court sets, the Lakers would pound the ball into Kareem, who was all but automatic on his patented sky-hook shots, from 15 feet and in. As a trio, Magic, Worthy, and Kareem won three titles (1985, 1987, and 1988).

These Lakers, of course, squared off against the Celtics and their Bird-McHale-Parish big three, in three separate trips to the Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987). For their part, the Lakers settled any debate on the floor, winning two out of these three title showdowns. In Game 4 of the 1987 Finals, with time winding down, Magic took an inbounds pass on the wing, up-faked, and drove past McHale into the lane. From there, Johnson buried a running hook shot of his own -- in front of a shocked Boston Garden crowd.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>1. Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_532399" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-532399" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Vincent-Laforet-AFP-Getty-Images-640x486.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Best Big Threes of All Time" width="757" height="575" /> Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls | Vincent Laforet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Ironically, it was Dennis Rodman and the Bad Boy Pistons that largely burnished the championship mettle of Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and the Chicago Bulls. The original Jordan Rules called for Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars to funnel No. 23 into the paint, where big men Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and Dennis Rodman lay in wait to dole out hard fouls.

The scheme literally dared Jordan’s supporting cast to step up in the postseason. For his part, Rodman was especially rough on Pippen, who he threw into the basketball support on multiple occasions. The Bad Boy Pistons spanked and humiliated the Bulls out of the playoffs in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

In 1991, a mentally tougher Jordan and Pippen finally got past the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, en route to their first three-peat. In 1995, the Bulls actually traded Will Perdue straight up for their former tormentor, prior to making their second tree-peat run. With Rodman, the Bulls could throw an attack dog on the front-line with six more fouls to battle against the likes of Shaquille O’Neal and Karl Malone in the post.

As individual defenders, a strong case may be made that Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman were the all-time best at their respective positions. On defense, Jordan and Pippen were free to roam the perimeter for deflections, steals, and weak-side blocks, knowing full well that Rodman would control the boards.

After controlling the basketball, Rodman would pivot out and fire a sharp outlet pass to Scottie Pippen. From there, it would be off to the races, with Michael and Scottie playing a game of give-and-go on the break that would result in a graceful dunk at the front of the rim.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Draymond-Green-and-Steve-Kerr-of-the-Golden-State-Warriors.jpg" alt="with referee Tony Brothers in the second quarter against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game Three of the Western Conference Finals during the 2016 NBA Playoffs" width="756" height="499" /> Draymond Green and Steve Kerr argue a call. | J Pat Carter/Getty Images[/caption]

When the dust settled on the 2016 NBA Finals and a championship earned by the city of Cleveland, it's clear to say that the Golden State Warriors had a much harder time during the playoffs than they didin the regular season. First, Steph Curry was hurt and had to sit a few games in the early rounds. Luckily that didn’t really change things on the court, as Golden State took care of the Houston Rockets and Portland Trailblazers 4-1 in each series.

But a seven game series against the Oklahoma City Thunder -- where, in some spooky foreshadowing, the Warriors were trailing OKC three games to one before coming back to win the series -- saw the Dubs struggle for the first time all playoffs. It looked like something of an aberration, especially after the pair of blowouts that opened the Finals, but ultimately the Dubs weren't able to to close out the series. Some food for thought: the Warriors lost nearly as many games in the NBA Playoffs (nine) as they did all regular season long.

When the Warriors went down before winning a championship, it make them one of two teams this year <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-are-the-2015-16-spurs-one-of-the-10-greatest-teams-ever.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that were historically good but got knocked out before they 'should have' in the postseason</a>. Here are a few of the other teams in NBA history that couldn’t close the deal on a championship, rated by not only regular season record but also point differential and how far they made it in the postseason before being eliminated.

<h2>6. 1995-96 Seattle SuperSonics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505354" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505354" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Gary-Payton-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="9 Feb 1997: Seattle Supersonics forward Shawn Kemp (right) and guard Gary Payton confer during the NBA All-Star game in Cleveland, Ohio.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>64-18, +7.8 point differential, lost in NBA Finals</strong></span>

The Sonics were led by head coach George Karl and his two studs, point guard Gary Payton and power forward Shawn Kemp. They had a bunch of  solid role players on that team as well, in Hersey Hawkins, Sam Perkins, and Detlef Schrempf. They buzzed through the Western Conference in the regular season, racking up 64 victories and finishing with the number one seed in the West.

But they ran into a problem, despite their star-studded roster and high octane play—the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, who set the NBA record that season with their 72-10 regular season record. The Bulls took the first three games of the NBA Finals series with the Sonics before Seattle rebounded with wins in games four and five, thanks to a tactical adjustment from Seattle that saw The Glove switched onto his Airness. Ultimately, though, the Bulls clinched their fourth championship in six seasons with an 87-75 victory behind 22 points from Michael Jordan and 19 rebounds from Dennis Rodman.

<h2>5. 1996-97 Utah Jazz</h2>
[caption id="attachment_558223" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-558223 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Malone-and-Barkley-ROBERT-SULLIVAN-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ROBERT SULLIVAN/AFP/Getty Image" width="757" height="515" /> Karl Malone and the Jazz were stopped by the Chicago Bulls twice in the 90s. | Robert Sullivan/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">64-18, +8.8 point differential, lost in NBA Finals</span></strong>

The Jazz had a Hall of Fame trio leading their team, with Jerry Sloan drawing up the X’s and O’s for John Stockton and Karl Malone. Jeff Hornacek played the third option on the court well, scoring 14.5 points on 48.2% shooting. The Jazz also had a slew of quality role players, such as Bryon Russell, Howard Eisley, Shandon Anderson, and Antoine Carr.

Utah ran into the same problem that the Sonics had just the year prior — the Bulls. Chicago had a 69-13 regular season record in this season, not quite as nice as their 72 wins from the year before, but still certainly nothing to sneeze at. The Bulls took game one of the NBA Finals against the Jazz on a buzzer-beater from Jordan and won Game Two by twelve points, to take a 2-0 lead in the series. The Jazz bounced back and managed to tied the series, sending it to a pivotal game five. Of course this was the game where Jordan, stricken with the flu, dropped 38 points in one of his most memorable performances of his career. The Bulls then won game six back in Chicago on a Steve Kerr jumper, clinching the NBA Championship.

<h2>4. 2008-09 Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_528684" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-528684" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lebron-Gene-Sweeney-Jr.-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="556" /> LeBron James, looking not so excited during a game with the Cleveland Cavaliers | Gene Sweeney Jr.[/caption]

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">66-16, +8.9 point differential, lost in Eastern Conference Finals</span></strong>

For the '08-'09 season, the Cleveland Cavaliers had LeBron James, at age 24, playing the best basketball of his young career. The team had strong role players around James, such as Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams, but nowhere near the star power he needed to win a championship. Nevertheless, Cleveland grabbed the number one seed in the (L)East by finishing four games ahead of the Boston Celtics and swept their first two playoff opponents, the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks.

But the Orlando Magic, overlooked most of the year due to the high profile status of the Cavs, Celtics, and Lakers, were too tough for Cleveland. Dwight Howard shot 65.1% from the field in the six-game series, putting up monster numbers — 25.8 points and 13.0 rebounds per game -- while a squad of sharpshooters rained down threes behind him. LeBron performed well for his team, carrying the Cavs with 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists in the series, but it just wasn’t enough.

<h2>3. 1972-73 Boston Celtics</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IMlh2O-Bm6s?rel=0"></iframe>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">68-14, +8.2 point differential, lost in Eastern Conference Finals</span></strong>

The 1972-73 Boston Celtics appeared to be headed for the list of all-time great NBA teams, but it wasn’t meant to be. The team was loaded with names that would not only resonate in the era, but for future eras in the NBA through their work in the league—John Havlicek, Jo Jo White,  NBA MVP Dave Cowens, Don Nelson, Don Chaney, Paul Silas, and Paul Westphal all were included in this early 70s Celtics juggernaut.

But Havlicek hurt his right shoulder badly in the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks, and the Celtics quickly fell down into a 3-1 hole. They stormed back, winning each of the next two games, but New York took care of them in game seven at the Boston Garden and went on to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. If there’s any consolation for Boston fans, it’s that New York lost the NBA Finals, 4-1 to Los Angeles, and have endured roughly four decades of mediocrity since.

<h2>2. 2015-16 San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_600051" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-600051" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Love-Dunks-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, OH - NOVEMBER 19: Kevin Love #0 of the Cleveland Cavaliers puts pressure on Tim Duncan #21 of the San Antonio Spurs during the first half at Quicken Loans Arena on November 19, 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>67-15, +10.6 point differential, lost in Western Conference Semi-Finals</strong></span>

This most recent Spurs squad might have gone down as the  the greatest team never to win a championship—at least, if Golden State had been able to close out the Cavaliers. The attention they received, or lack thereof, during the regular season was as a direct result of the record breaking season Golden State had. That’s not to diminish the Warriors' spectacular year at all, but the Spurs were, however quietly, a historically great NBA team.

San Antonio played the year with a mix of old, battle-tested veterans and new, up-and-coming stars. Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker with Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge seemed like a mix that could be strong enough to take down the mighty Warriors. But along the way, the Oklahoma City Thunder played spoiler. The Thunder took the series in six games, but only outscored the Spurs by an average of 0.5 points per game — an indication that the series was certainly closer than you might have thought, and certainly closer than the box scores would indicate.

<h2>1. 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Golden-State-Warriors-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="Golden State Warriors react on the bench during Game 5 of the WCF. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" />
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>73-10, +10.7 point differential, lost in NBA Finals</strong></span>

Whether you want to add an asterisk to their regular season or not is up to you, but in terms of record and point differential, the Golden State Warriors were the best NBA team to fail to win an NBA Championship. After taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the Finals the Warriors squandered chance after chance to close out the series (and Draymond's suspension for Game 5 stands out here), and ultimately couldn't capitalize on the kind of play that lead them to so much success over the last year. On the other hand, back-to-back Finals appearance is nothing to sneeze at, and being the top team in the Western Conference is equally awesome. While no one can tell what the offseason will bring, it's hard to see the Lacob-run-team breaking it apart after falling short this season.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest teams</a> in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> history are the ones that, while made up of individuals, are able to come together to form the perfect cohesive unit. Fans often envision these clubs operating as a five-man jazz ensemble; each member spacing the floor to improvise, deliver pinpoint passes, and score. On the other end of the court, this group coordinates traps, rotates to the ball on dribble drives, and recovers back in to help on defense for timely rebounding off the glass.

When these teams take the floor, it truly is poetry in motion. And yet, as great as some of these teams are when they come together as a group, that doesn't mean we aren't going to give credit to certain players who possess incredible individual talent. These players are the ones who do more than just pass the "eye test." Most of the time, the word "dominant" doesn't do them justice. Simply put, they are "transcendent."

By all accounts, it can be difficult to adequately describe individual greatness with mere words. After all, the aura of excellence is best observed through eyewitness accounts. Therefore, basketball fans tend to simplify the meaning of greatness to a collection of first names: Wilt, Larry, Magic, and Michael. While the following list of great players for each position involves some opinion, the way we see it, this composition cannot be defeated.

<h2>Center: Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687530" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687530" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/72527490.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Greatest Players of All Time By Position" width="757" height="511" /> Wilt Chamberlain talks to the media. | Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

Wilt Chamberlain’s video-game-like dominance over the NBA was completely comical. In 1973, the Big Dipper completed his 14-year career with an unreal <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-point/22-rebound/4-assist</a> per game average. As an offensive force, 7-foot-1 Chamberlain led the league in scoring during his first seven NBA seasons.

Chamberlain’s multiple scoring crowns included his signature <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/wilt100_moments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100-point game</a>, during which he abused the 1961-62 New York Knicks in every way possible in Hershey, Penn. That year, Chamberlain averaged 50 points and 25 rebounds per game for the regular season.

Stung by early criticism of operating as a selfish black hole in the paint, Chamberlain was to further develop his playmaking talents as he matured. Remarkably, Chamberlain led the NBA in assists as a 31-year-old center, with 702 total dimes. However, some say that Chamberlain was more concerned with accumulating statistics than he was with winning titles.

Many historians casually categorize Chamberlain’s body of work as the antithesis of his bitter rival Bill Russell. Through moxie, hustle, and determination, Russell took home 11 championships in 13 seasons with the Boston Celtics. Chamberlain, of course, performed in Philadelphia and Los Angeles without the benefits of Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, or Sam Jones as teammates.

He did bring home two titles for the 76ers and Lakers in 1967 and 1972, respectively. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1972_finals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 1972</a>, Chamberlain claimed Finals MVP honors as an elder statesman who proved to be the missing link for the championship dreams of Gail Goodrich and “The Logo,” Jerry West.

<h2>Power forward: Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685789" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685789" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450684012.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Greatest Players of All Time By Position" width="757" height="518" /> Tim Duncan runs down the floor. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Tim Duncan was so good for so long that he is almost boring. A technically sound big man who has combined the lateral quickness of David Robinson with the precise footwork of Kevin McHale to go to work in the low post. On the block, Duncan could reach deep into his bag of tricks on every possession to destroy the opposition with an assortment of drop steps, up-and-under moves, spins, hook shots, and turnaround jumpers.

In space, Duncan was equally effective from his triple-threat stance. From the wing, Duncan could either put the ball on the floor to blow past lumbering stiffs or pull up to hit sweet mid-range jumpers off the glass from 18 feet and in. On the defensive end, he played the angles to cut off post moves, rotate on the weak side, and recover back into the lane to box out and clean up the glass for rebounds.

In 19 seasons as a San Antonio Spur, Duncan has <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duncati01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turned in workmanlike averages</a> of 19 points, 10.8 boards, three assists, and 2.2 blocks per game. A winner, Duncan represents the centerpiece of a Spurs dynasty that has claimed <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/6/16/5813384/spurs-five-nba-championships-history-tim-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five championships</a> during his tenure at starting power forward.

<h2>Small forward: Larry Bird</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594015" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594015" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Larry-Bird-JOHN-MOTTERN-AFP-Getty-Images-640x451.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Greatest Players of All Time By Position" width="757" height="533" /> Larry Bird, head coach of the Indiana Pacers and former NBA player | John Mottern/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Larry Bird redefined the small forward position. As a shooter, the Hick from French Lick was automatic from nearly all points within his side of the half-court line. With a quick feint or forearm shiver, the crafty Bird would work to keep defenders off balance and create just enough space to rise up and drain his patented overhead jump shot.

In the post, Bird was equally as unstoppable. He could pin smaller opponents on his back to knock down fadeaway jumpers or spin into the lane for easy layups and dunks. As a passer, Bird rivals LeBron James as the greatest front-court playmaker of all time. Through his 13-year career, Bird played the angles to feed his Celtic teammates for easy scores from their favorite spots on the floor.

In the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1988.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1987-88</a> season, Bird put it all together as he ran roughshod over the league to rack up 29 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists per game. As a three-time champion, Bird was especially dangerous in the clutch, when he would carry the city of Boston on his back and will its storied franchise to glory.

During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfLjD5ft6o4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'88 Eastern Conference semifinals</a>, Bird squared up and went toe-to-toe to match a red-hot Dominique Wilkins bucket-for-bucket in the fourth quarter. When the smoke cleared, Bird walked away with 34 points (20 in the fourth quarter) and yet another Game 7 triumph. Beyond that, Bird, of course, will forever be linked to Magic Johnson atop the grand marquee of the Lakers-Celtics rivalry.

<h2>Point guard: Earvin “Magic” Johnson</h2>

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/magic-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic Johnson</a>’s Showtime Lakers served as the perfect contrast for the gritty team play of Larry Bird and his Boston Celtics. With Magic flashing his trademark smile, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Byron Scott, and Michael Cooper were all too happy to run the floor, fill the lanes, and catch crisp passes that led to easy transition buckets.

At point guard, Magic could completely dominate the flow of the game without even scoring. As a 20-year-old kid, he burnished his image as one of the greatest winners in all of sports. As a rookie, Johnson put together one of the most memorable postseason performances of all time to close out the Philadelphia 76ers in the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2012/story/_/page/BestFinalsGame-Individual-2/best-single-game-performances-no-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game 6 Finals clincher</a>.

While playing all five positions, Magic torched Philadelphia for 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists, earning himself Finals MVP in the process. From there, he collected four more championship trophies for Los Angeles against the 76ers, Celtics, and Bad Boy-era Pistons.

Starting from his days as a Michigan State star, Magic was always in rare form against rival Larry Bird. His sweeping hook shot across the lane to seal a Finals victory on the Boston parquet hardwood will forever remain burnished as part of NBA lore.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Shooting guard: Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_604709" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-604709" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jordan-Mike-Nelson-AFP-Getty-Images-530x500.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Greatest Players of All Time By Position" width="757" height="714" /> Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls | Mike Nelson/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]

Without question, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/michael-jordan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> is the baddest man to ever put on a pair of basketball shorts. A fierce competitor, Jordan took pleasure in breaking opponents’ wills and making them eat their words at mid-court. For motivation, Jordan would manufacture perceived slights and disrespect before he would go ballistic, drop 50, and eventually muscle his way to <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/bulls_dynasty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six championships</a>.

As a young star, Jordan was often ridiculed as a gunner out for his own stats. In the 1986-87 season, he averaged 37.1 points per game, as he largely refused to accommodate his own teammates. For years, the Bad Boy Pistons would install the “Jordan Rules” -- they would collapse their defense upon No. 23, dare him to share the ball, and physically dominate the Bulls.

Jordan, of course, did not emerge as the ultimate winner until 1991, when he learned to trust the likes of Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, John Paxson, and head coach Phil Jackson. That year, Jordan and his supporting cast finally swept the Pistons out of the playoffs en route to establishing a Bulls dynasty.

By then, Air Jordan had transformed his game to that of a complete player. He ultimately closed out a 15-year career having posted averages of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 2.3 steals per game</a>. In his prime, Jordan had no weaknesses on the floor.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_745902" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745902" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LeBron-James-Cleveland-Cavaliers-LeBron-Jr.-Bryce-2016-NBA-Finals.jpg" alt="LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers celebrates with his sons LeBron Jr. and Bryce after winning the 2016 NBA Finals." width="757" height="505" /> The 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers are some of the greatest NBA players — but they'll never have to worry about joining this list. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

If anything is considered the pinnacle of a basketball career, it’s got to be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-5-greatest-nba-teams-never-to-win-a-championship.html/">winning an NBA championship</a>. Setting aside the time-honored tradition of little boys shooting in the driveway, a ring on the resume of a professional can make all the difference between two cliches: the gritty gamers who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/more-rings-are-better-the-13-most-successful-nba-players-ever.html/">do anything to win</a> versus selfish ball hogs.

It goes without saying that these comparisons are unfair for this team game. Any championship run requires the perfect storm of savvy front office negotiating, tough coaching, and plain luck. You can do everything in your power to sign the right players and manage egos, but you still need to avoid injuries and make sure your players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-clutch-nba-players-in-the-game-right-now.html/">knock down clutch shots</a>.

At the end of the day, every game has losers and winners. The greatest NBA players to never win a championship are the same ones who routinely wound up on the wrong side of history, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/">facing dynasties</a> like the Lakers, Celtics, and Chicago Bulls. That said, here are five of the greatest NBA players to never win a championship.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Patrick Ewing</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691024" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691024" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51967402-e1409157094807.jpg" alt="Patrick Ewing looks to pass." width="757" height="517" /> One of the greatest NBA players of all time, Patrick Ewing never got to put a championship ring on his finger. | Mark D. Phillips/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The New York Knicks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/all-time-starting-5-for-the-new-york-knicks.html/">selected Patrick Ewing</a> with the first overall pick in the <a href="http://www.thepostgame.com/blog/hruby-tuesday/201205/conspiracy-theory-david-stern-michael-phelps-patrick-ewing-michael-jordan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiracy-laden 1985 draft</a>. He was supposed to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/">savior of the franchise</a>. Instead he turned into fodder for the Chicago Bulls. After the Bad Boy Pistons, Ewing and the Knicks were arguably the toughest playoff out for the Bulls. As Pat Riley stalked the sideline, the Knicks attempted to replicate the Pistons’ physical style, with Charles Oakley, Anthony Mason, John Starks, Xavier McDaniel, and Ewing taking direct orders to slow down the game and dole out hard fouls.

The Bulls, however, knocked Ewing and his Knicks out of the playoffs in 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1996. Ewing did get past the Bulls in 1994, with Michael Jordan temporarily on hiatus from the NBA. Sadly, the Knicks fell to Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets that season. Although ringless, Ewing averaged 21 points and 10 rebounds per game <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-who-should-have-retired-sooner.html/">over his 17-year career</a>.

<h2>4. Allen Iverson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_788072" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-788072 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Allen-Iverson-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Allen Iverson listens to his fans cheer. " width="757" height="493" /> Allen Iverson listens to his fans cheer. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

At <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-shooting-guards-of-all-time.html/">shooting guard</a>, Allen Iverson gets the nod above both George “Ice Man” Gervin and Pistol Pete Maravich because of a deep postseason run and a Finals appearance to his credit. In the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson ran into the middle of the Lakers’ three-peat, led by the formidable one-two punch of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.

While Philly went down four games to one, Iverson carried on as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nba-players-every-franchises-history.html/">franchise's sole hope</a>, flanked by players like Eric Snow and an aging Dikembe Mutumbo. In any event, A.I. torched the Lakers for 36 points per game through this championship series.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_646416" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-646416" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Allen-Iverson.jpg" alt="Allen Iverson poses on the court as the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall Of Fame 2016." width="757" height="512" /> Allen Iverson poses on the court as the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall Of Fame 2016. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Arguably the toughest man to play the game of basketball, Iverson stood just 6 feet tall and weighed in at a mere 165 pounds, but that didn’t stop his fearless drives to the hoop. A.I. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-hated-villains-in-the-history-of-the-nba.html/">never shied away</a> from the contact and physical play of much larger forwards and centers. For his career, Iverson averaged 27 points per game after leading the league in scoring through four separate seasons.

Without a championship to his name, however, Iverson is often dismissed as a “me-first” man who famously refused to attend or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI">talk about practice</a>. A petulant performer, Iverson largely wore out his welcome in Denver, Detroit, Memphis, and the NBA at large after his glory years in Philadelphia.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Charles Barkley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715033" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715033" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52027858-e1414005526892.jpg" alt="Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan laugh as they stand on the court." width="757" height="506" /> Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan laugh as they stand on the court. | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Charles Barkley unceremoniously predated the likes of Eric Lindros, Iverson, and Donovan McNabb as a superstars who led perennially competitive teams but failed to bring championship glory back to Philadelphia. In the City of Brotherly Love, Barkley <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-new-top-12-all-time-nba-scorers.html/">averaged 23 points</a>, 12 rebounds, and four assists per game while making six trips to the playoffs in eight years.

The Philadelphia 76ers, however, never had enough to get past the Boston Celtics and a budding Bulls dynasty. In 1992, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/25-worst-trades-nba-history.html/">76ers dealt</a> the Round Mound of Rebound to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for spare parts, aka Tim Perry, Andrew Lang, and Jeff Hornacek.<!--nextpage-->

During his first year in Phoenix, a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/">rejuvenated Barkley</a> racked up 26 points, 12 rebounds, and five assists per game while claiming MVP honors. That postseason, Sir Charles upped his per-game averages to 27 points, 14 rebounds, and four assists before facing off against Jordan in the NBA Finals. His Airness and the Bulls dispatched of the Suns in six games. For the series, Jordan went off for 41 points, nine rebounds, and six assists per game, as if he had a point to prove in schooling the reigning MVP.

By 1996, Barkley left Phoenix for Houston and teamed up with Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, who both won championships during Jordan’s first retirement. In 1998, Drexler retired, and Scottie Pippen came on board in Houston. As a Rocket, however, a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-most-memorable-moments-of-charles-barkleys-broadcasting-career.html/">past-his-prime Barkley</a> was often injured and failed to get past the Western Conference Playoffs.

<h2>2. Elgin Baylor</h2>
[caption id="attachment_788108" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-788108 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Baylor-Kevin-Winter-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Elgin Baylor speaks to the audience during an NBA event." width="757" height="601" /> Elgin Baylor speaks to the audience during an NBA event. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images[/caption]

The Minneapolis Lakers drafted Seattle University's Elgin Baylor with the first pick in the 1958 NBA Draft. For his rookie season, Baylor <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-nba-players-who-are-scoring-maniacs.html/">put up 22 points</a>, 13 rebounds, and four assists per game before <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/">leading his team</a> to the NBA Finals.

As a sign of things to come, the Boston Celtics swept the Lakers and took the 1959 championship. Then, two seasons after this Finals loss, the Lakers left Minnesota for the bright lights of Los Angeles. Baylor emerged as the face of the then one-sided rivalry between the Lakers and Celtics. For his career, Baylor <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/">made eight trips to the Finals</a> (seven for LA, one for Minneapolis) but lost each time.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_645772" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-645772" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Elgin-Baylor-of-the-Los-Angeles-Lakers.jpg" alt="NBA legend and former Laker Elgin Baylor acknowledges the crowd during a Los Angeles Lakers game." width="757" height="489" /> NBA legend and former Laker Elgin Baylor acknowledges the crowd during a Los Angeles Lakers game. | Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In all, Baylor and the Lakers lost seven championship series to the Celtics. Baylor, plagued by an assortment of injuries, retired early in the 1972 season. This decision was all the more tragic because the ’72 Lakers, which featured Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Gail Goodrich, went on to win an NBA title against the New York Knicks.

<em>[Editor’s note: Because Baylor began the 1972 season with the eventual champions, the Los Angeles Lakers, there is an argument to be made for his exclusion from this list. He had a championship ring, after all, which he has <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/05/30/elgin-baylor-auction-lakers-clippers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">since auctioned off</a>. But as he was not on the active roster during the playoffs or during the majority of the regular season, he is routinely counted as not having won an NBA championship.]</em>

<h2>1. John Stockton and Karl Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_788112" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-788112 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/John-Stockton-Karl-Malone-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="John Stockton and Karl Malone address the media after losing the NBA Finals." width="757" height="502" /> John Stockton and Karl Malone address the media after losing the NBA Finals. | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

John Stockton and Karl Malone might have been hailed as the greatest ever at their respective positions -- had they matched the championship moxie of Magic Johnson and Tim Duncan. Stockton, despite his choirboy looks and tight shorts, was a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-most-known-for-playing-dirty.html/">hard-nosed competitor</a> out on the floor. He pushed, grabbed, and held on to frustrate opponents and draw fouls.

Meanwhile Malone, at 6-foot-9, was a physical specimen who dominated the low block. They were <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-accomplished-nba-duos-of-all-time.html/">nearly inseparable</a> on the court during their NBA careers. It doesn’t seem right to acknowledge one without the other, underscored by their 1993 All-Star Game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_star_mvp.html">co-MVP awards</a>. For their careers, Stockton dished out a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/unbreakable-nba-records.html/">league-leading 15,806 assists</a>, while the Mailman scored 36,928 points. (He was second only to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in total point output.<span class="s1">)</span><!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_709733" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709733" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/John-Stockton_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="John Stockton speaks during a Basketball Hall of Fame event." width="757" height="506" /> John Stockton owns multiple unbreakable records. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

During the ’90s, “Stockton to Malone” was more than a a recurring phrase; it was a mantra repeated for layups, mid-range jumpers, baby hooks, and hammer dunks. To keep defenses honest, Stockton would curl off solid Malone screens before rising up and burying a deep three-point bomb. As an individual, Malone <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-nba-players-1990s.html/">claimed MVP honors</a> for the 1997 and 1999 regular seasons.

The Jazz made two back-to-back trips to the NBA Finals through this run. Both involved Stockton and Malone in their prime. Michael Jordan, however, prevailed against this duo in the NBA Finals <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-conspiracy-theories-surrounding-michael-jordan.html/">with his flu game heroics</a> and fourth-quarter strip of Malone beneath the basket. With time winding down, Jordan buried the game winning-jump shot. He closed out the 1998 Finals in front of Byron Russell and a shocked Salt Lake City crowd.

Every team that has advanced to the postseason begins with a clean slate. That’s the beauty of the playoffs. If a team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-nba-teams-have-the-longest-active-playoff-streaks-2.html/">finds itself on a roll</a>, or if a matchup works out in its favor, then anything is possible. This is the time of year when you better play your best ball. It doesn’t matter what’s happened so far this season; it doesn’t matter if you’re the league MVP or your team finished with the best record. The playoffs are when <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-players-dropped-50-or-more-in-an-nba-playoff-game.html/">legends are born</a> and history is made.

History has not always worked out for the best teams in the NBA. On occasion, the day <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-underdog-won-nba-championship.html/">may belong to the underdog</a>. In a way, that’s when the sport becomes the most interesting. When teams come out of nowhere to topple the favorites, we’re reminded just how talented NBA players truly are. If you play in this league, then you’ve got skills. End of story.

And when these players rise to the occasion, we get to bear witness to David <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-heroic-losses-in-nba-playoff-history.html/">taking down Goliath</a>. Here’s a look at the five greatest upsets in NBA playoff history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. The Grizzlies topple the Spurs (2011 Western Conference first round<span class="s1">)</span></h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWUUOM_Zc4Q"></iframe>

The Memphis Grizzlies entered their 2011 first-round contest against the San Antonio Spurs as the lowly No. 8 seed, but this proved to be irrelevant. Sometimes the most important thing in the postseason is a favorable matchup. That’s exactly the position the Grizzlies found themselves in.

Despite being the top team in the West, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/great-nba-teams-didnt-win-championship.html/">Spurs proved no match</a> for Memphis power forward Zach Randolph. Z-Bo averaged 21.5 points and 9.2 rebounds in the series, including a monster Game 6, in which he put up 31 points on 12 field goals. The Spurs showed their age against the upstart Grizzlies and wound up losing the series, 4-2.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. LeBron can’t handle the Boston Celtics (2010 Eastern Conference semifinals)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zC2JF3l-4Lo"></iframe>

Heading into the 2010 playoffs, the Cleveland Cavaliers boasted a 61-21 record and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. And yet, most of the chatter revolved around where LeBron James would be playing the following season. Perhaps if the Cavs had won an NBA championship that year, James may have never <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-moments-when-we-hated-lebron-james.html/">bolted for Miami</a>. Things didn’t play out that way.

Cleveland came up against a more experienced Boston Celtics team in the Eastern Conference semis and couldn’t stand up to the Big Three. Despite being up 2-1 after three games, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2010_ECS.html#BOS-CLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavaliers lost Games 4 to 6</a>, and that was all she wrote for James’s first stint in Cleveland. The Cavs may have lost the series in six games, but given their superstar’s “<a href="http://www.nba.com/2010/news/07/09/cavs.owner/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a>" in Game 5, a Boston victory seemed almost inevitable.

<h2>3. The Detroit Pistons ruin the Hollywood ending (2004 NBA Finals)</h2>

When the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Lakers met in the <a href="http://www.landofbasketball.com/championships/year_by_year.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2004 NBA Finals</a>, smart money suggested that the title would head back to tinseltown. That couldn’t have been further from the truth.

Besides getting 26.6 points per game from Shaquille O’Neal and 22.6 from Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were completely manhandled by the 21st century version of the “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-most-known-for-playing-dirty.html/">Bad Boys</a>." The Pistons were physically dominating, limiting LA to just 81.8 total points per game. This star-studded Los Angeles team simply fell short. Way short. Point guard Chauncey Billups would go on to win the Finals MVP, and Detroit would take the series 4-1.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. The Denver Nuggets take down the No. 1 seed (1994 Western Conference first round)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGt25SRmdg"></iframe>

Never before in the history of the NBA had a No. 8 seed taken down a No. 1 seed. That was until the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-franchises-longest-title-droughts.html/">Denver Nuggets</a> played the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the 1994 playoffs. The Sonics, who came into the postseason sporting a 63-19 record, would go up two games to none to start this best-0f-five series. They looked to be in complete control and appeared ready to sail smoothly into the next round. No one told the Nuggets that.

Behind 16 points per game from LaPhonso Ellis and 31 total blocks from Dikembe Mutombo, Denver would storm back to win the final three games and <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/94nuggets_moments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take the series, 3-2</a>. With this monumental upset, we soon learned that anything was possible once the NBA Playoffs began.

<h2>1. The Warriors prove too strong for the Dallas Mavericks (2007 Western Conference first round)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuMTBV7XkA8"></iframe>

The Dallas Mavericks finished the 2006-2007 regular season with a final record of 67-15. They were the best team in the Western Conference and appeared to be the team to beat in the NBA. When they got matched up against the eighth-seeded <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/playoffs/2015/tickets#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden State Warriors</a>, who squeaked into the playoffs with a 42-40 mark, no one was thinking upset. And then the Warriors’ Baron Davis went to work.

The 27-year-old torched the Mavs for 25 points per game, which included shooting 45.5% from three-point range. Golden State would outscore the Mavericks by almost seven points a contest in the series and lead them in offensive rating, 113.8 to 106.6. The Warriors <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/sports/basketball/04cnd-warriors.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won the series, 4-2</a>, becoming the first No. 8 seed in history to defeat a No. 1 seed in a best-of-seven series. We’d say the Dubs have come a long way since then.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cavaliers-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kyrie Irving, LeBron James, Kevin Love, and J.R.

In the Eastern Conference finals of the 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-most-exciting-matchups-of-the-2017-nba-playoffs.html/">NBA Playoffs</a>, the Toronto Raptors <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surprised everyone</a> when they stole not one, but two games against a Cleveland Cavaliers team that should never drop a pair of contests to a squad like Toronto.

The difference between them is roughly the difference between a Nerf hoop and an NBA hoop, and before you point to the regular-season record -- the Raptors were the second seed and finished one game behind Cleveland -- we'll direct you to the fact that the Raptors play in the Atlantic, which is easily the least-competitive division in the league (save Boston).

All said, the Cavaliers looked good in the third and fourth games, but they entered Game 5 looking like the sort of team that hadn't lost a playoff game until they wound up in Canada -- and ultimately <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201605250CLE.html">won 116-78</a>. Yes, you read that score correctly. Talk about a monumental beatdown.

It was not a close game at the end. It was nearly never a close game while it happened. When color commentator Jeff Van Gundy returned from a break with, "If you're <a href="http://fansided.com/2016/05/26/cavaliers-thrash-raptors-game-5/">just tuning in</a>, tune out!" he was only half joking, as the Eastern Conference finals shifted back into Cleveland's favor with all the excitement of watching someone else watch paint dry. It was, as they say, a blowout.

This isn’t the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-smackdowns-in-nba-history.html/">first lopsided affair</a> to take place in the playoffs. But what are some of the other greatest stomps? Let’s find out. Here are the five biggest blowouts in NBA playoff history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. 1971 Western Conference semifinals: Milwaukee Bucks 136, San Francisco Warriors 86</h2>
[caption id="attachment_689119" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-689119" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar-Kris-Connor-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar looking dapper." width="757" height="537" /> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Pretty Good At Basketball, most say. | Kris Connor/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Margin of victory</span>: 50 points

The San Francisco Warriors found themselves in a hole to start <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197104040MIL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game 5</a> of the 1971 Western Conference semifinals, and things only got worse. They trailed the Milwaukee Bucks by 20 points at the end of the first quarter, and by halftime they were down 69-35.

The Warriors had no answer for the duo of John McGlocklin and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> (then Lew Alcindor), who scored 28 points and 23 points, respectively. This was the last game of the series, as the Bucks closed it out 4-1. Prior to this game, no other contest in the series had been decided by more than 14 points. Clearly that wasn’t enough for the Bucks.

<h2>4. 2015 Eastern Conference first round: Chicago Bulls 120, Milwaukee Bucks 66</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jld1Z2w7LMs"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Margin of victory</span>: 54 points

If the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-chicago-bulls-of-all-time.html/">Chicago Bulls</a> hoped to make a statement when they finished off the Milwaukee Bucks, then they certainly succeeded. Aside from the 54-point beating they put on the Bucks, the Bulls dominated in every facet of this game. Milwaukee shot just 32.9% from the field and 21.1% from three-point range. The Bulls managed to hit 51.1% of their shots and knock down 50% of their triples.

The Bulls had nine more rebounds, six less turnovers, and 14 more assists. Milwaukee overachieved on the season, but the team's inexperience exposed itself in <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201504300MIL.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game 5</a>. The Bulls, of course, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-lebron-jamess-finals-appearances.html/">later fell to LeBron James</a> and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

<h2>3. 1973 Western Conference finals: Los Angeles Lakers 126, Golden State Warriors 70</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708367" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708367" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52034672.jpg" alt="Wilt Chamberlain brings up the rock." width="757" height="524" /> Wilt Chamberlain was possibly the greatest singular force in NBA history. | Wen Roberts/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Margin of victory</span>: 56 points

The Los Angeles Lakers took a 3-0 lead in the 1973 Western Conference finals after blowing out the Golden State Warriors by a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197304210GSW.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">score of 126-70</a>. Rick Barry did all he could for the Warriors, but he and his team-high 10 points were no match for the dominant road team. For the Lakers, Jim McMillian led the way with 28 points. The team also got 17 points from Mel Counts and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-playoffs-5-highest-scoring-players-ever.html/">16 from Jerry West</a>.

Los Angeles benefited from extra trips to the free-throw line in this contest; the Lakers had 31 attempts to the Warriors’ 17. In all honesty, this game was never really close, with Los Angeles outscoring Golden State in every quarter. At least the Warriors only had to play against a 36-year-old <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-all-time-great-nba-basketball-players-by-position.html/">Wilt Chamberlain</a>. If he was younger, the outcome would’ve been a whole lot worse.

<h2>1. (tie) 1956 Western Division semifinals: Minneapolis Lakers 133, St. Louis Hawks 75</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiH9ed48e2U"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Margin of victory</span>: 58 points

The Minnesota Lakers set the bar for most lopsided affair in NBA Playoffs history when they annihilated the St. Louis Hawks <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/195603190MNL.html">by 58 points</a>. It was March 19, 1956, and the Lakers found themselves down 1-0 entering Game 2.

They needed to win this contest or they’d be eliminated from the playoffs in the Western Division semifinals. Minneapolis did just that -- in emphatic fashion, we might add. While you would think this sort of victory might swing the momentum in the Lakers’ favor, it did no such thing. The St. Louis Hawks regrouped to win Game 3 and the series with a 116-115 victory.

<h2>1. (tie) 2009 Western Conference first round: Denver Nuggets 121, New Orleans Hornets 63</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFvf_ZVX8G8"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Margin of victory</span>: 58 points

The Denver Nuggets achieved this same margin of victory -- courtesy of a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200904270NOH.html">121-63 win</a> -- against the New Orleans Hornets in Game 4 of the 2009 Western Conference's first round. Despite being on the road, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/carmelo-anthony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmelo Anthony</a> lit up the home team for 26 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. Chauncey Billups provided some help with 17 points, and J.R. Smith came off the bench to add 12 points to the mix.

The Hornets only shot 31.5% from he field, which was not good enough to top a Nuggets team that hit 56.6% of their shots. Unfortunately, this game only put New Orleans in a 3-1 hole in the series. As a result, the team had to endure one more massive playoff defeat -- losing by 21 in Game 5 -- before the season was over.

			<title>NBA History: 7 Players Who Talked a Ton of Trash</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The talent level in the NBA may be high, but today's game lacks the trash-talking skills of yesteryear. Here are 7 players who did this art form proud.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not every NBA player <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-dirtiest-players-in-nba-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wants to be a role model</a>. When Paul Pierce knocked down the go-ahead triple with 8.3 seconds to play against the Hawks in the 2015 NBA Playoffs, he turned to the Atlanta bench and had the audacity to say, “<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/paul-pierce-called-series-after-nailing-three-pointer-immediately-loses-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series.</a>" That’s it. That’s all he uttered. But, wow, that’s some big-time smack right there.

Pierce was so certain that this last shot was going to be the back breaker for the Hawks, that he had the guts to tell them this series was over. That’s how you do it — that’s how you throw shade on your opponent. Of course, this would, ultimately, end up backfiring in Pierce’s face, the Wizards would wind up losing the series to Atlanta. But still, it was awesome.

It was a throw-back moment to the NBA of old. A time when players jabbed at each other and were just as fierce with their words as they were with their jumpers. Pierce didn’t win the game, but we will remember his words — and a time when this lost art form was another reason why we love this game. So with that in mind, here’s a look at the seven biggest trash talkers in NBA history.
<h2>1. Charles Barkley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_801170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charles-Barkley-e1431631367642.jpg"><img class="wp-image-801170 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Charles-Barkley-e1431631367642.jpg" alt="ROBERT SULLIVAN/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="574" /></a> Robert Sullivan/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Charles Barkley was an absolute monster on the basketball court. Despite being an undersized power forward, he still managed to average <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barklch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22.1 points and 11.7 rebounds per game</a> for his career. Aside from being one of the best players in NBA history to never win an NBA title, Barkley was (and still is) one of the sport’s biggest characters. He was a big proponent of trash talking — so long as you were good enough to back it up. And Sir Charles certainly was; which is way this Hall of Famer completely lacked a filter, and had no problem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;v=t0NDRsohA5g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mixing it up with the best there ever was</a>. Barkley always did have the gift of gab.

<h2>2. Gary Payton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_801205" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gary-Payton-e1431633324344.jpg"><img class="wp-image-801205 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gary-Payton-e1431633324344.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="493" /></a> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Point guard <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paytoga01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Payton</a> played the game one way, and one way only: In your face. And he was great at it. That’s how he got the nickname “The Glove." Of course, that sort of style extended beyond his skills on the basketball court. Which is why GP was a top-notch trash talker. In fact, he told <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3696384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Patrick in a 1999 ESPN The Magazine</a> interview, that he once went so far to tell former Nets center Jamie Feick, “Man, you won’t even be in the league next year." Payton had no qualms with hurting other players’ feelings (like he did with Feick). And just think, he’s <a href="http://www.viralhoops.com/gary-payton-trash-talking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">done worse</a>.
<h2>3. Rasheed Wallace</h2>
If there was ever going to be a player to bring back the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19891990.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Boys</a>" persona to the city of Detroit, it was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/883/rasheed-wallace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rasheed Wallace</a>. He played hard, he played physical, and he always let you know he was there. ‘Sheed had no issues with arguing with the officials — he is the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rasheed-wallace-technical-fouls-record-2012-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time leader in technical fouls</a> — and he was not one to shy away from getting ejected. But what made Wallace such a great trash talker, was the fact the he was kind of hilarious when he did it. Not many players can pull this out. But then again, there weren’t many players like Rasheed Wallace. When it comes to his ability to talk smack, the “<a href="http://ballislife.com/rasheed-wallaces-best-techs-ejections-ball-dont-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ball don’t lie</a>."

[caption id="attachment_801231" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Reggie-Miller-e1431634560990.jpg"><img class="wp-image-801231 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Reggie-Miller-e1431634560990.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr /Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /></a> Brian Bahr /Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>4. Reggie Miller</h2>
<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/552/reggie-miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reggie Miller</a> could shoot the rock from behind the arc. In a career that spanned 18 seasons, Uncle Reg connected on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millere01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2,560 three pointers</a> — second most all time. But the thing about this Hall of Famer, was that he couldn’t just make the shot; he had to let you know about it. Miller hits three, he talks smack. Miller nails a pull-up jumper, he’s in your ear. And he didn’t just let his opponents know when he was on fire, he would let them know when they were stinking up the court. We can’t count how many times Miller would put his hands on his own throat to signal that another player was “choking." That was just Miller being Miller. Don’t believe us? Just <a href="http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/lee-and-miller-18-years-later/?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ask Spike Lee</a>.
<h2>5. Kevin Garnett</h2>
Aside from his undeniable talent, the best thing about <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kevin_garnett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Garnett</a> is that he plays with incredible tenacity. This guy is ferocious and intense and inspires the same from his teammates. Best of all, he’s always been this way. Garnett plays the game of basketball with his heart on his sleeve and, sometimes, that requires him to be vocal on the floor. OK.<em> A lot </em>of times that requires KG to be vocal on the floor. The Big Ticket talks to himself, he talks to opposing players, and he picks on the weak. If you can’t handle that sort of “craziness," we suggest staying away from Garnett. As Thunder Center Steve Adams once <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/13/steve-adams-kevin-garnetts-trash-talk-makes-you-question-whether-playing-basketball-is-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said about KG’s trash-talk game</a>:

“Yeah, it’s like really weird,” Adams recalled. “He’s talking to himself, but he like makes you feel bad because he mentions you in it. You’re like, ‘What the hell? This is crazy?’ I walk away so I don’t hear it because then, I don’t know, I’ll get real sad.”

That’s some heavy stuff right there. But totally worth the price of admission.

<h2>6. Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_801236" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-e1431634954201.jpg"><img class="wp-image-801236 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-e1431634954201.jpg" alt="STEVE SCHAEFER/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="532" /></a> STEVE SCHAEFER/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> is the greatest basketball player of all time. He could do it all on the floor — shoot, drive, dribble, defend — and he did it all so well. His Airness was a winner and competitor and someone you didn’t want to mess with. But sometimes, players would decide to run their mouths at Jordan. And that’s when he took his competitive nature to entirely different level. In these moments, the beast was woken — and you knew you were in trouble. Jordan would <a href="http://www.viralhoops.com/michael-jordan-trash-talking-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show no mercy</a>. His opponents should’ve known better.
<h2>7. Larry Bird</h2>
What made Larry Bird such a great trash talker was that you wouldn’t expect Larry Bird to be such a great trash talker. After all, he was just “The Hick from French Lick." But Bird was extremely competitive, and therefore felt the need to put opponents in their place. With a straight face, he would tell his defender how he was going to score, and then do it. He would insult players that were guarding him by telling his teammates he was open. This was just who Larry Legend was — a smooth operator, with a perfect jumper, and nasty trash-talking skills. There have been a lot of talkers in NBA history, but Bird was so good at it that, most of the time, you had to wonder “<a href="http://www.viralhoops.com/larry-bird-trash-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who was coming in second</a>?"

We've seen <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/">LeBron James</a> do some incredible things over the years. But with his Cleveland Cavaliers down 25 points at halftime against the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their 2017 first-round series, the King added another accomplishment to his already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-top-nba-players-ever-rank.html/">legendary status</a>. He led the defending champs to the greatest second-half comeback in the history of the NBA Playoffs.

James finished the night with a remarkable 41 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists. And the Cavaliers <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/cleveland-cavaliers/post/_/id/3980/lebron-james-leads-cleveland-to-historic-comeback-win">pulled off the stunning victory</a> by the score of 119-114. In discussing his superstar's incredible performance, Cleveland head coach Tyronn Lue had this to say: “LeBron willed us home, 41, 12 and 13, played the whole second half. That’s what playoff basketball is all about. You got to be willing to sacrifice and lay it on the line to win a game, and that’s what he did for us.”

As sensational as this second-half comeback was, it's hardly the first time teams overcame massive deficits in NBA Playoff history. In fact, some clubs are able to do it in just the fourth quarter. See for yourself.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: Warriors 123, Pelicans 119 (OT)</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fourth-quarter deficit</span>: 20 points</li>
</ul>
Just when it appeared as if <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-a-complete-history-of-the-quadruple-double.html/">Anthony Davis</a> and the New Orleans Pelicans would roll to a Game 3 victory in the 2015 NBA Playoffs, the Warriors decided that a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit wasn’t anything they couldn’t overcome. Behind 40 points on the night from <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/stephen-curry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Curry</a> and 28 points from his fellow Splash Brother, Klay Thompson, Golden State rallied to take the game in overtime, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201504230NOP.html">123-119</a>.

It’s not as if Davis didn’t come to play that night. He provided the Pelicans with a 29-point, 15-rebound performance. It’s just that the final quarter belonged to the visiting team, who once again showed why they were the top squad in the NBA. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nbas-deadliest-3-point-shooters-ever.html/">Curry’s crazy three-pointer</a> with seconds remaining sent the game into overtime and capped a remarkable comeback that saw Golden State outscore New Orleans 39-19 in the last quarter.

In a season filled with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-the-most-incredible-shots-of-his-career.html/">incredible moments</a>, there was no reason for the road team not to be excited about what they had done. Following the improbable win, Curry reiterated the <a href="http://scores.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=400790903">importance of this game</a>: “You know how big of a deal it is to come back from a deficit like that in the playoffs on the road, in a game we knew was very important for us to really take control of this series. So I think we should celebrate the accomplishment."

To say what the Warriors did was an accomplishment would be an understatement (oh, and they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/teams-that-need-a-movie-made-about-them.html/">won the NBA championship</a>, too). This was only the third time ever in postseason play that a team overcame a 20-point deficit when entering the final frame.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final score</span>: Celtics 94, Nets 90</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fourth-quarter deficit</span>: 21 points</li>
</ul>
On <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200205250BOS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 25, 2002</a>, the Boston Celtics made a furious comeback against the then-New Jersey Nets in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics entered the fourth quarter down 21 points, but they were not about to lose on their home floor. They also had one thing the Nets didn’t: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-who-could-retire-after-this-season.html/">Paul Pierce</a>.

The former Kansas Jayhawk started off the contest missing 12 of his first 14 shots. Apparently, he wanted to save his best for last. Pierce finished the game with 28 points, including 19 points in the fourth quarter, and the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-boston-celtics-in-nba-history.html/">Celtics outscored</a> the Nets 41-16 in the final frame.

While speaking with reporters following the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=220525002">historic comeback</a>, Pierce said, “At the start of the fourth quarter we just wanted to fight and make a statement for the next game that we’re going to be a team to be reckoned with. I think we did more than make a statement."

The Celtics went on to lose the series six games, but not without a fight. And that’s the truth.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fourth-quarter deficit</span>: 21 points</li>
</ul>
During the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, the Los Angeles Clippers decided to make some history of their own on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201204290MEM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 29, 2012</a>. Down 85-64 at the start of the fourth quarter of Game 1 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Chris Paul <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=320429029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never stopped believing</a> in his team. He knew the Clippers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-in-los-angeles-clippers-history.html/">had what it took</a> to fight their way back into the contest. And they didn’t disappoint.

Los Angeles went on to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-worst-franchises-league-history.html/">outscore the Grizzlies</a> 35-13 in the final period, connecting on five three-pointers and making 13-17 shots from the field. The Clippers also got some serious play out of their reserves, with Nick Young leading the way. He came off the bench to score a team-high 19 points and connect on three of his four shots from beyond the arc.

This complete team effort allowed Los Angeles to steal the momentum on the road, and they eventually took the series in seven games.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[An elite Big Man is the ultimate cornerstone of any franchise. Great <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tim-duncan-greatest-power-forward-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power forwards and centers</a> score at will in the post, make plays on the defensive end, and dominate the paint to grab tough rebounds in traffic. A balanced team often combines a strong interior presence alongside clutch outside shooting to win ballgames. The Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, and San Antonio Spurs franchises have all built celebrated dynasties behind Hall-of-Fame NBA big men anchoring the low block.

NBA lore has been built on images of Shaquille O’Neal tearing down the basket support, Wilt Chamberlain scoring at will en route to 100 points, Bill Russell making the calls on defense, Tim Duncan wheeling and dealing down low for easy scores, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar rising up to deliver his patented sky hook. They are unstoppable.
<h2>10. David Robinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51994571-e1409156869922.jpg" alt="Doug Collier/Getty Images" width="757" height="602" /> Doug Collier/Getty Images[/caption]

Remarkably, David Robinson stood out as a physical specimen within a league of world-class athletes. In the post, Robinson used his quickness and agility to slide past lumbering defenders for easy scores time and time again. In space, The Admiral would either rise up to knock down mid-range jump shots or dribble drive to the basket for hooks, layups, and dunks. On the defensive end, Robinson was a quick leaper who would fly across the lane to block shots and control the boards for key possessions. In all, he finished up his 14-year career with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html">21-point, 11-rebound, and 3-block per game averages.</a>

Due to his ‘Nice Guy’ demeanor, Robinson has been historically criticized for his lack of a killer instinct. After claiming 1995 MVP honors, Robinson went on to get torched by an angry Hakeem Olajuwon, who dominated the Spurs in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1995_WCF.html#HOU-SAS">playoffs for 35 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 assists per game averages</a>.

In 1998, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest with the first overall pick. From there, David Robinson was to join forces with one of the greatest power forwards ever and bring two NBA championships back home to San Antonio in 1999 and 2003.

<h2>9. Charles Barkley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695940" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695940" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51607313-e1410280520520.jpg" alt="PAUL BUCK/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="646" /> PAUL BUCK/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Standing at a mere 6-foot-4, the Round Mound of Rebound played with a reckless abandon, and transformed himself into one of the game’s greatest big men through heart and desire. Before LeBron James, Sir Charles was the runaway freight train that would crash the defensive boards, control the basketball, and turn up court. As a playmaker, Barkley would attack the goal with a full head of steam before throwing down his trademark gorilla dunk over any stiff who stood in his way.

For Philadelphia, Barkley was a force who used his wide girth and explosive leaping ability to dominate the low block. Over time, Barkley added a mid-range jump shot to his game to star as the total package at power forward. With limited postseason success, however, Barkley talked his way out of Philadelphia and was shipped off to Phoenix in a blockbuster trade for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang.

In 1993, Barkley put it all together for the Phoenix Suns. That MVP season, Sir Charles had added an effective three-point shot to his arsenal, while also improving further as a ball-handler. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/history/awards/_/year/1993">For the year</a>, Barkley turned in 26 points, 12 rebounds, and 5 assists to go alongside 1.6 steals and 1 block per game. Barkley and his Suns, however, were to be denied a championship by Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.

<h2>8. Moses Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682828" align="aligncenter" width="467"]<img class="wp-image-682828" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52032066-e1410280652950.jpg" alt="MARK PHILIPS/Getty Images" width="467" height="774" /> MARK PHILIPS/Getty Images[/caption]

Moses Malone was a workhorse, and His name became synonymous with the term “double-double,” as this big man dominated the paint for points and rebounds through 21 years of professional basketball. As a prep-to-pro, Malone made an immediate impact within the professional ranks when he hung up 19 points and 15 rebounds per game for the Utah Stars during <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonmo01.html">1974-1975 regular season</a>. After two seasons in the ABA, Moses Malone made the transition to the NBA, where he starred at Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington before finishing out the twilight of his career in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and San Antonio.

As a blue-collar player, Moses Malone <a href="http://www.landofbasketball.com/awards/nba_rebounds_leader_year.htm">led the league in rebounding</a> six times between 1978 and 1985. When working the boards, Malone was adept at playing the angles to carom shots before boxing out and grabbing rebounds. He was especially dangerous on the offensive glass, where his pogo-stick leaping ability would own the opposition for easy put-backs and dunks.

Offensively, Malone operated with the total package of drop steps, hooks, and fade-away shots to score the basketball on the low block. At 6’10”, Malone was also able to put the ball on the floor and bull his way toward the basket from the elbow area. In his best season, Moses Malone averaged 31 points and 15 rebounds per game as a member of the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/1982.html">1981-1982 Houston Rockets.</a>

As a three-time NBA MVP, Moses Malone was heralded as the final piece of the championship puzzle in Philadelphia. The 1983 76ers destroyed the competition behind the wing acrobatics of Julius Erving, microwave scoring of Andrew Toney, floor leadership of Maurice Cheeks, and, of course, the rugged post presence of Moses Malone.

<h2>7. Karl Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695957" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695957" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/52183127.jpg" alt="ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="485" /> ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Karl Malone was a beast. As 6’9″ and 250 pounds of muscle, it was impossible to root Karl Malone out of the low block. In the post, The Mailman would seal off defenders and set up shop on the low block for easy scores. Over time, Malone developed a face-up game from 15 feet, in which he could knock down mid-range jumpers, beat his man off the dribble drive, or even turn and spin to swish a fadeaway shot.

The Mailman, of course, was only one half of the Stockton to Malone drumbeat parade. Stockton to Malone for the scoop shot lay-in off the pick and roll. He fed Malone for the pretty-boy, behind-the-head dunk in transition. And he curled off the Malone screen to hit the dagger three and fire up the crowd at Salt Lake. Over the course of 19 years, Stockton to Malone largely translated into <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html">36,928 points</a> for the Mailman and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ast_career.html">15,806 assists</a> (first of all time) for his point guard. Malone finished his career second on the all-time scoring list, only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Karl Malone, however, was left standing at the championship altar by Michael Jordan. Jazz fans will forever shudder at the image of No. 23 stripping the basketball out of Malone’s alligator arms and coming back to cross over Bryon Russell at the top of the key for the game-winning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdPQ3QxDZ1s">1998 NBA Finals shot</a>.

<h2>6. Hakeem Olajuwon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691011" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-691011" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52033665-e1409156399955.jpg" alt="Bob Strong/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="508" /> Bob Strong/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

A former soccer player, Hakeem Olajuwon packaged the agility of a guard into the frame of a 7-foot center. Famous for his Dream Shake, Olajuwon would devastate opponents with his mix of shimmies, spin moves, hook shots, and fadeaway jumpers. On the defensive end, Hakeem Olajuwon was a cat-quick center that roamed the interior for timely steals and blocks. For his career, The Dream <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/olajuha01.html">averaged 3.1 blocks and 1.7 steals per game</a> as a defensive maven.

In his prime, Hakeem Olajuwon challenged and dominated all comers. In the Western Conference Finals, Olajuwon took David Robinson to school before abusing Patrick Ewing and a young Shaquille O’Neal to bring two championships back to Clutch City.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW4uXlRGAF0">Picture Hakeem Olajuwon</a> facing up David Robinson on the baseline and putting the ball on the floor to cross over the Admiral. In the post, Olajuwon would spin, wheel and deal, up fake, and lift Robinson off his feet before dropping in a sweet scoop shot.

<h2>5. Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685789" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685789" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450684012.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="518" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The Big Fundamental has been a model of consistency. On the low block, Tim Duncan combined the technical footwork of a Kevin McHale alongside the lateral quickness of mentor David Robinson. Tim Duncan’s precise demeanor has often been compared to insurance sales and tax preparation. On the wing, Tim Duncan has been able reach into his bag of tricks to hit bank shots off the glass, dribble drive into the paint, and work his post-up game for clutch baskets right at the front of the rim.

With his stoic nature and winning ways, Tim Duncan is the perfect match for military town San Antonio. As the focal point of the Spurs’ dynasty, The Big Fundamental may now claim <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/6/16/5813384/spurs-five-nba-championships-history-tim-duncan">five NBA championships</a> to his credit, making him one of the greatest power forwards of all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Shaquille O’Neal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691008" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691008" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52011694-e1409156258999.jpg" alt="Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="639" /> Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

An unreal combination of size, speed, and athleticism, Shaquille O’Neal starred as the most dominant NBA force throughout his prime. Standing 7’1″ and weighing in at 325 pounds, O’Neal would simply bowl people over to get what he wanted. As a literal man amongst boys, Shaq camped out in front of the basket, took entry passes, and powered his way up for dunks time and time again. In response, frustrated coaches would employ the Hack-A-Shaq defense and send entire front line personnel to take him down. Never mind that — Shaq would simply discard his fellow 7-foot brethren as if they were mere rag dolls before he tore down the basket support.

In Orlando, Shaq teamed up with sidekick Penny Hardaway to create a formidable one-two punch before leaving for the bright lights (and money) of L.A. With the Los Angeles Lakers, The Big Aristotle joined forces with a young Kobe Bryant to win <a href="http://www.nba.com/2013/history/05/17/2002-los-angeles-lakers-three-peat/">three titles</a>. Like all things Hollywood, of course, the Laker marriage between Shaquille O’Neal, Phil Jackson, and Kobe Bryant inevitably blew up due to high drama. As the casualty of the divorce, Shaq was shown the door and given his golden watch alongside a one-way ticket to Miami.

As a member of the Miami Heat, Shaquille O’Neal fell back to play the role of Robin to Dwyane Wade’s Batman when the pair brought a <a href="http://www.nba.com/2013/history/05/17/2006-dwyane-wade-thrills-in-finals/">championship title to South Beach</a>. After the confetti settled, Shaq ultimately took his act to Phoenix, Cleveland, and Boston – in an attempt to chase after even more rings.

<h2>3. Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695970" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695970" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/483637827.jpg" alt="Ricardo B. Brazziell-Pool/Getty Images" width="757" height="550" /> Ricardo B. Brazziell-Pool/Getty Images[/caption]

Bill Russell was the greatest defensive center of all time. He revolutionized the idea of help defense, as he would either rotate off his man to protect the rim on the dribble drive and block shots, or recover back into the passing lane for steals and deflections. A fierce rebounder, Russell learned to play the angles and use his quick leaping ability to control the boards.

Largely due to instinct and technique, the great Bill Russell was able to average <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html">23 rebounds per game</a> throughout his 13-year career. Although Russell rarely had his number called in offensive sets, he also tacked on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html">15 points and 4 assists per game</a> to go alongside his impressive defensive prowess.

Most importantly, Bill Russell was a winner. As the anchor of the Celtics’ dynasty, Russell brought home a total of <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html">11 championships</a> to the city of Boston. In doing so, Bill Russell commanded the respect of Bob Cousy, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and, of course, archrival Wilt Chamberlain, as the ultimate competitor.

<h2>2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691018" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691018" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1137370-e1409156639174.jpg" alt="Mike Powell/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Incredibly, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA career actually exceeded tall-tale expectations. Over the course of 20 years, Abdul-Jabbar amassed 38,387 total points and hung it up as the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html">NBA’s all time scoring leader</a>. To rack up points, Abdul-Jabbar would tower over opponents to drop in his patented skyhook. Good from either hand, Kareem was automatic on the block from fifteen feet and in.

As a winner, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar took home a total of six rings that mirrored his career arc. In <a href="http://www.nba.com/bucks/history/1971-championship-team">1971</a>, Abdul-Jabbar had immediate success as the savior of the Milwaukee Bucks and helped an aging Oscar Robertson claim his one and only championship. For the Los Angeles Lakers, the prideful Kareem gradually passed the leadership torch over to Magic Johnson. By 1988, Abdul-Jabbar had made the transition from a focal-point center and into an effective role player of the Showtime Lakers. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar retired at the age of 42, after having won <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/abduljabbar_bio.html">six NBA championships</a>.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got it done.

<h2>1. Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687530" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-687530" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/72527490.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr /Allsport" width="756" height="510" /> Brian Bahr /Allsport[/caption]

Wilt Chamberlain was the greatest NBA big man of all time. Throughout his career, the Big Dipper put up video game-like numbers. A giant before his time, Chamberlain led the NBA in both scoring and rebounding during his first four seasons as a professional. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHW/1962.html">In 1961-1962</a>, Chamberlain posted a staggering 50-point, 26-rebound per-game year for the Philadelphia Warriors. This season also includes The Stilt’s signature <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/wilt100_moments.html">100-point game</a> where he absolutely dominated the New York Knicks. As somewhat of an added bonus, Wilt actually led the NBA in total assists during 1968.

As a natural talent, Wilt Chamberlain’s individual abilities can never be denied. And although Bill Russell may have had Wilt’s number, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, and Sam Jones never walked through that door for the Big Dipper as teammates. In any event, Chamberlain’s legacy did include two NBA titles. Wilt Chamberlain left the game of basketball with nothing else left to prove.

		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible to objectively determine the loyalty of an NBA team's fan base? It may very well be. Here are the 5 teams that get the most love.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_832971" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mavericks-fans-MARK-RALSTON-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438693221144.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832971 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mavericks-fans-MARK-RALSTON-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438693221144.jpg" alt="Dallas Mavericks fans show their support" width="757" height="536" /></a> Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Is it possible to calculate a fan’s loyalty to a particular team? You might not think so. After all, loyalty and devotion to an organization is more a feeling and a show of commitment than anything else. However, if commitment is at least somewhat rooted in actually showing up, then perhaps there is a way to accurately quantify an individual’s loyalty. Fortunately for us, someone actually took the time to figure this out with regard to fan bases of the National Basketball Association.

<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleacher Report’s</a> Adam Fromal believed the only way to remain objective — to an extent — when figuring out the loyalty of NBA fans, was to determine the difference between an organization’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual home attendance</a>, and the attendance a team was <em>expected</em> to reach. How did he go about doing this? Per Fromal’s description:
<blockquote>First, we have a team’s actual attendance figures at home from the turn of the century through the end of the 2014-15 campaign. We’re not worried about crowd noise, social-media presence or anything of that ilk, but rather how many fans bother to shell out the dollars necessary to actually attend a contest for their favorite team.

Second, we have expected home attendance, which is based entirely on a team’s record during the regular season. After looking at actual attendance and win percentage during each of the last 15 seasons, we found a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17n_dTZ4mBfmyRTYdavZ6mSS5aJrgsq23MH2H_632OEc/pubchart?oid=475495625&amp;format=interactive">best-fit line</a> that allows us to see what a team’s crowd <em>should </em>look like during any given season.

Exceed those expectations consistently, and your loyalty looks good. Fail to meet them, and you’re falling down in the ranks.</blockquote>
It’s definitely an interesting way of trying to gauge overall fan loyalty. And one we’re certain will not only start an interesting debate, but also cause some varying levels of outrage. Just remember, we didn’t break down the data from the past 15 years, we’re merely the messengers. With that in mind, here’s a look at the five NBA teams with the most loyal fan bases

<h2>5. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832953" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jack-Nicholson-Michael-Buckner-Getty-Images-e1438692074623.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832953 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jack-Nicholson-Michael-Buckner-Getty-Images-e1438692074623.jpg" alt="Jack Nicholson cheers on the Los Angeles Lakers" width="757" height="641" /></a> Michael Buckner/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Actual Home Attendance</span>: 98.9%</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expected Home Attendance</span>: 93.2%</li>
</ul>
It’s one thing to be supportive when a team is winning titles, it’s another thing to stay true when you’re squad can’t seem to get their act together. <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2535015-which-nba-fanbase-has-been-the-most-loyal-during-the-past-15-years/page/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the calculations</a> from Bleacher Report, Los Angeles Lakers lovers are certainly not fair-weather fans.

Despite going <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21-61 in the 2014-15 season</a>, attendance at Lakers games was still expected to reach 80.6%. In actuality, the Staples Center saw an average attendance of 98.3%. It would appear <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/15-diehard-celebrity-sports-fans.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diehard fan</a> Jack Nicholson isn’t the only one who values the experience of attending a Lakers game. Whether the purple and gold were winning or losing, Lakers Nation remained devoted to its favorite basketball organization.

<h2>4. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832955" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Spurs-fans-ROBYN-BECK-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438692385664.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832955 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Spurs-fans-ROBYN-BECK-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438692385664.jpg" alt="San Antonio Spurs fans cheer on their team" width="757" height="541" /></a> ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Actual Home Attendance</span>: 100.1%</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expected Home Attendance</span>: 97.9%</li>
</ul>
When judging the loyalty of NBA fan bases, Fromal managed to remain objective by following a specific formula. However, we decided to throw this out the window when looking at the <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Antonio Spurs</a> faithful. If you were to find the difference between the club’s actual home attendance and what the home attendance was projected to be, it would put these fans toward the bottom of the barrel. In fact, they would hit <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2535015-which-nba-fanbase-has-been-the-most-loyal-during-the-past-15-years/page/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No. 16 on the list</a>. Considering this franchise’s success over the past 15 years, according to Bleacher Report, that didn’t seem right.

You can’t fault a fan base for remaining loyal to a team that continues to set the NBA-standard for consistency. Even if this examination is based on exceeding expectations, it’s noted that the Spurs are only one of two organizations that have an actual home attendance in the triple digits. On top of that, San Antonio has the highest expected attendance of any team in the National Basketball Association. Bleacher Report made sure to throw four asterisks at the Spurs organization to note its outlier status within this experiment. Still, to say Spurs fans aren’t loyal, would be doing this whole analysis a disservice.

<h2>3. Dallas Mavericks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832959" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mavs-fans-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-e1438692801631.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832959 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Mavs-fans-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-e1438692801631.jpg" alt="Dallas Mavericks fans show their support for Dirk Nowitzki" width="757" height="511" /></a> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Actual Home Attendance</span>: 103.3%</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expected Home Attendance</span>: 95.9%</li>
</ul>
With an expected home attendance of 95.9%, the Dallas Mavericks sit one rung below that of the San Antonio Spurs. And yet, according to Bleacher Report, the Mavs hold the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2535015-which-nba-fanbase-has-been-the-most-loyal-during-the-past-15-years/page/13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest attendance numbers</a> of any NBA franchise since 2001.

Per <a href="http://www.mavs.com/2015-mavs-fan-appreciation-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobby Karalla of Mavs.com</a>, Dallas has the longest active sellout streak in American sports, at 618 games. If you include the postseason, this would be around 15 straight seasons worth of sellouts.

No matter the figures, the Dallas Mavericks fan base continues to exceed expectations. To have an actual home attendance of 103.3% over the past 15 years, is definitely something worth celebrating.

<h2>2. Chicago Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832988" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bulls-fans-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1438694605349.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832988 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Bulls-fans-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1438694605349.jpg" alt="Chicago Bulls fans show their support" width="757" height="504" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Actual Home Attendance</span>: 98.6%</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expected Home Attendance</span>: 89.6%</li>
</ul>
The current Chicago Bulls have not reached the same level of success as the teams led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. And we’re not expecting that to ever happen. Those squads were among the best teams in NBA history. Yet, according to Bleacher Report, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2535015-which-nba-fanbase-has-been-the-most-loyal-during-the-past-15-years/page/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only during the 2001-02 season</a> did the actual home attendance <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/attendance/_/year/2002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drop below 90%</a>. For the past 15 years, Bulls fans have continued to show up and support their guys — 9% more than expected. With numbers like that, it’s no wonder the Chicago faithful hold firm as the No. 2 most loyal fan base in the NBA.

<h2>1. New York Knicks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832982" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Spike-Lee-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images-e1438693839791.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832982 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Spike-Lee-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images-e1438693839791.jpg" alt="Spike Lee cheers on the New York Knicks" width="757" height="504" /></a> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Actual Home Attendance</span>: 99.3%</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expected Home Attendance</span>: 87%</li>
</ul>
To put it nicely, the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Knicks</a> are far from the most competitive team in the National Basketball Association. Yet, the fans continue to come out in droves to show their support. Based on Bleacher Report’s calculations, Madison Square Garden has had <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2535015-which-nba-fanbase-has-been-the-most-loyal-during-the-past-15-years/page/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">99.3% of its seats filled</a> since the 2000-01 season. This gives the Knicks the fourth highest home attendance among all the teams in the league.

What distinguishes New York from the pack, is their lousy showing on the court. Based on their regular-season records over the past 15 years, Knicks home attendance was expected to be 87%. By exceeding those figures by 12.3%, it’s apparent that basketball at this storied arena goes beyond wins and losses. For that, New York Knicks find themselves with the most loyal fan base in the NBA.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_500105" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-500105" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Larry-OB-Trophy-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players of All Time" width="756" height="520" /> The Larry O'Brien trophy is raised. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

As we roll through another installment of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a> season, there’s no better time to look at the most bejeweled players in the NBA; the ones with more than one hand of championship rings; the players, both superstars and role-fillers, who ended up on winning teams most often.

On one end of the spectrum, they’re the anti-Lombardi -- NBA athletes who have won more but are clearly not as talented as their less-bejeweled peers. On the other end, they make a strong case for “best of all time full stop forever.” Usually the truth is somewhere in between.

While one of the great fan pastimes is to attempt to measure an athlete’s motor, the fact is that if you’re at the highest level of any given professional sport, you’re at least a little invested in how you play. All that said, let’s look at the most ringed of the be-ringed; the players who’ve spent the most time around the Larry O’Brien Trophy (some even before it was the Larry O’Brien Trophy). Here are the 13 winningest NBA players ever.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Six rings: Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Scottie Pippen, and Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_500106" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-500106" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Jordan-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players of All Time" width="757" height="503" /> Michael Jordan with the reaction. | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Right off the bat, two of these guys were arguably the best pair of wing players to ever wind up on the same team (that’d be Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen), and although Dwyane Wade and LeBron James come close, they didn’t play together at the peak of their powers (especially Wade). Jordan and Pippen could guard anyone, no matter how good and no matter how tall.

Their tenacious defense was the key to their back-to-back threepeats, and their terrifyingly competitive nature (especially Jordan’s) ensured that every game was personal. It stands to reason that they were the two best players on the best NBA team of all time.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, though. Kareem was a different breed. Along with his skyhook, he was a team unto himself, a designation reflected by his position as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdulka01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finishing with 38,387 points</a> over his 20-year Kareer (…sorry), the former Lew Alcindor won one ring with Milwaukee and five more with the Los Angeles Lakers. He grabbed Finals MVP awards decades apart. He was great.

With all due respect to Kareem, though, he wasn’t the revolution that Bob Cousy was. Back in the ’50s, Cooz changed the game. Simple as that. Watch these highlights below and remember that no one was doing anything like that at the time -- a time when he led the Celtics to six championships, including five in a row from 1959-63.

<h2>Seven rings: Robert Horry, Frank Ramsey, and Jim Loscutoff<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_500107" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-500107" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Robert-Horry-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Robert Horry chats with the ref. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Don’t bother to Google, we'll tell you who Frank Ramsey is. Ramsey, who has more rings than Michael Jordan, is a Hall of Fame basketball player who played on the same teams as Cousy, winning rings in 1957 and 1959-64. He took a year off to join the Navy, because back then the NBA didn’t pay quite the same as it does now. He’s also popularized as the NBA’s first Sixth Man, the guy who didn’t start, but was first off the bench.

And Jim Loscutoff? Same deal; a Celtics great from back in the day (he was drafted in 1955), Loscutoff is notable for refusing to have his number, 18, retired. Instead, the same number was retired for Dave Cowens, and the Celtics raised a jersey inscribed “Loscy” up with the rest of the banners.

Robert Horry is probably more familiar. Big Shot Bob, unlike Ramsey, is well-known for having more rings than Jordan, having lent his talents to the Hakeem-Drexler Rockets, who won back to back championships in ’94 and ’95; the Shaqobe Lakers, who are the last team to threepeat; and two rings with the Spurs, who won in 2005 and 2007. Horry’s the prime example of the uber-role player, since his only elite NBA talent was hitting clutch shots. Seriously. In case you were too young to see Horry contribute, here’s some of his finest moments:

<h2>Eight rings: John Havlicek, Satch Sanders, K.C. Jones, and Tommy Heinsohn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_500113" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-500113" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tommy-Heinsohn-Chip-Somodevilla-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Tommy Heinsohn looks on. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images[/caption]

It should come as no surprise that there is an army of Boston Celtics legends on this list. That’s what happens when you’re a member of the most successful franchise in NBA history. These four players, John “Hondo” Havlicek, Satch Sanders, K.C. Jones, and Tommy Heinsohn, were essential members of the Celtics dynasty, the team that reeled off 11 championships from 1957 until 1969.

Of those eleven, each of these guys overlap a bit. Heinsohn was the first drafted, in 1957, while Hondo came last in 1963. Tommy, the only person in NBA history to be employed by a franchise in one capacity or another for every single one of the Celtic’s 17 championship seasons, retired after nine seasons, but not before founding the NBA player’s union.

Of the group, Sanders played the longest; a thirteen-year career that spanned from 1960 all the way until 1973. Here are all four of them playing against the San Francisco Warriors in the 1964 NBA Finals (complete with the original broadcast commentary):

<h2>10 rings: Sam Jones
11 rings: Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_500116" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-500116" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Bill-Russell-Mansoor-Ahmed-Getty-images.jpg" alt="The 13 Most Successful NBA Players of All Time" width="757" height="500" /> Bill Russell enjoys the game. | Mansoor Ahmed/Getty Images[/caption]

Rounding it off, perhaps unsurprisingly, are two more Boston Celtics: Sam Jones and Bill Russell. Russell is the guy who the NBA Finals MVP award is named after, the most successful NBA Champion in the history of the league. Most recently, Russell was spotted being curmudgeonly towards LeBron, <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-reveals-the-faces-of-his-nba-mount-rushmore.html/">who famously left Russ off his personal NBA Mount Rushmore</a>. But who is Jones?

Jones was a wing on all those championship Celtics teams save ’57, because he wasn’t drafted by the Celtics until 1959. Curiously enough, he was actually drafted by the Minneapolis Lakers (later to become the Los Angeles Lakers), but he never played for the team. Tough loss for the Lakers, who could’ve maybe cut into the Celtics’ all-time lead in championships. The Lakers have 16, the Celtics have 17, the next closest team has six (Jordan and Pippen’s Bulls).

The NBA power forward <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-of-the-greatest-nba-big-men-of-all-time.html/">lays down the law</a> for his teammates with elbows, tough screens, and fierce rebounding. Because of the physical demands of the position, a power forward will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-most-known-for-playing-dirty.html/">engage in rough play</a> to mark his territory and intimidate the opposition. Knowledgeable NBA fans may think back to Kevin McHale clotheslining Kurt Rambis into the basket support; Dennis Rodman being Dennis Rodman; and Bill Laimbeer squaring up and going toe-to-toe with Charles Barkley at the Detroit Palace.

But beneath the thuggery, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/NBA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA</a>'s best power forwards of all time are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tim-duncan-greatest-power-forward-history.html/">exceptionally skilled players</a>. A great power forward can score at will as he reaches into his bag of tricks to whip out a collection of spin moves, drop steps, and turnaround jumpers. In space, a talented four will go triple threat, either knocking down open shots in the midrange game, or up-faking to put the ball on the floor for easy buckets.

On the defensive side of the ball, the best power forwards are tasked with shutting down opposing forwards and centers. In a battle for position, they simply outmuscle competing big men. After forcing his man away from the basket and into a contested shot, a good power forward will box out, clean the glass, and secure the rebound. Here’s our list of the NBA's 10 best power forwards of all time.

<h2>10. Dennis Rodman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683395" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683395" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/57510455-633x500.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="598" /> Joel Nito/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Dennis Rodman may be the greatest defensive forward of all time. In his prime, Rodman could guard and shut down all five positions on the floor. During his career, The Worm made seven appearances on the first-team all-defensive list. Rodman’s impact on the game was immeasurable, despite the fact that Rodman only averaged more than 10 points per game for one season during his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rodmade01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14-year career</a>. As a winner, The Worm helped bring home a total of five championships to Detroit and Chicago.

In Detroit, Rodman was the perfect fit for a Bad Boy Piston ball club that included fellow goons Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, James Edwards, and Isiah Thomas. Against the Bulls, the Pistons were to aggressively collapse into the paint and throw Michael Jordan into the basket support every time he attempted to drive the lane. Besides guarding MJ, Rodman was also unleashed to go tit for tat with the likes of Scottie Pippen, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, and Karl Malone as the ultimate bully. In San Antonio and Chicago, Rodman’s freak show antics transformed further into his full-body tattoos, wild hair, and random kicks to opposing groins.

Beneath the circus act, Rodman was the league’s greatest rebounder. Standing at a relatively short 6-foot-9, Rodman relied upon his quick leaping ability and smart anticipation to play the angles on caroms off the glass. Largely through desire, Rodman owned the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_yearly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA’s rebounding crown</a> for seven consecutive seasons between 1992 and 1998. Dennis Rodman just wanted it more.

<h2>9. Dolph Schayes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690481" align="aligncenter" width="529"]<img class="wp-image-690481" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1957_1958_topps_13_dolph_schayes_fr.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="529" height="719" /> Source: BMW Sportscards[/caption]

The game’s original star power forward and double-double machine, Dolph Schayes filled it up for his late-1940s to mid-1960s Syracuse Nationals with his flat-footed, two-handed set shot from 15 feet and in. When opponents crowded Schayes from the outside, he would take off and drive the ball into the lane with authority. As an offensive threat, Schayes completed his 15-year career atop the NBA scoring list with 18,438 points, which were also good for a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/schaydo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 point per game average</a>. Physically imposing for his era, the 6-foot-7 Schayes inflicted most of his damage inside to drop in layups and pick up cheap fouls. A deadly free throw shooter, Schayes led the NBA in accuracy on three separate occasions. As a rebounder, Schayes corralled 16 boards per game in 1951 before tearing through a rugged 11-season streak of double-digit rebounds.

<h2>8. Kevin McHale</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683421" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683421" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/481380759.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="505" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Kevin McHale had the best post moves and footwork of any big man not named Hakeem Olajuwon,. In his Torture Chamber, McHale would receive the entry pass on the low block before wheeling and dealing with an assortment of up-fakes, spins, and power drop steps. McHale was the master of the up-and-under move, in which he would pivot quickly and fake a short jumper before dipping low and laying the ball into the goal with his opposite hand. Before breaking the navicular bone of his right foot, Kevin McHale was at his best in <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1987.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1986-1987</a>, when he dropped 26 and 10 on the strength of 60 percent shooting from the floor and 84 percent accuracy from the free-throw line.

In Boston, McHale joined forces with Larry Bird and Robert Parish to form the imposing Big Three front line. With McHale dominating the painted area, this Celtics group went on to claim <a href="http://www.nba.com/celtics/history/legends/kevin-mchale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three titles in 1981, 1984, and 1986</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Dirk Nowitzki</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683422" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683422" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/488211023.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="504" /> Chris Covatta/Getty Images[/caption]

Standing at 7 feet tall and weighing in at 235 pounds, Dirk Nowitzki is one of the most atypical athletes to ever pick up a basketball. A match-up nightmare, Nowitzki is most comfortable in space, as he brings his finesse game to the power forward position. At power forward, Nowitzki is more likely to rain jumpers from the outside than he is to set up shop down low and bang bodies. The big German is especially dangerous in the high post, where he goes to work at the elbow area to either take the ball to the hoop or create a slither of space to knock down a midrange jump shot. As an offensive force, Nowitzki is still averaging a career <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nowitdi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23 points per game</a> over his 16-year NBA journey.

For years, the knock on Dirk was his alleged inability to carry the Dallas Mavericks on his back to the promised land of an NBA championship. To critics, Dirk was soft because he refused to get down and dirty in the post, and in the playoffs, Nowitzki had been knocked off his square by the likes of Stephen Jackson, Tracy McGrady, and Dwyane Wade as he struggled to take advantage of his size advantage versus quicker players. Nowitzki, of course, was to allay these concerns with his <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=6655454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clutch MVP performance</a> over the LeBron James, Wade, Chris Bosh, and the Miami Heat in the 2011 NBA Finals.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Kevin Garnett</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690446" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-690446" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/490626595.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="493" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Kevin Garnett is intense. Usually drenched in sweat, K.G. barks orders to control the back line of his team’s interior defense as if he were a middle linebacker. In help defense, Garnett has been gifted with the speed, length, and wiry strength to rotate off his man, protect the paint, contest a shot, and recover to box out on the glass. In his prime, Garnett was good for double-digit rebounds plus 2 steals and 2 blocks on the defensive end each night. Offensively, Garnett could always fill it up for <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garneke01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20-plus points</a> in his prime — with the total package of jab steps, spin moves, turnaround jumpers, scoop shots, and thunderous dunks.

In Minnesota, The Big Ticket was the only game in town over the course of 12 years. For the Timberwolves, Garnett left everything out on the floor to score, make plays for others, and shut down the post, only to be dismissed from the playoffs by the Lakers and Spurs dynasties time and time again. For relief, Garnett was part of a series of 2007 transactions that brought his services alongside those of Ray Allen to Bean Town. As part of the new Big Three, Garnett subjugated his game to immediately bring back the Larry O’Brien Trophy to Boston and uttered the momentous phrase “Anything is possible” after the Celtics’ blowout win over Los Angeles in 2008.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Bob Pettit</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683427" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683427" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/79792677.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="511" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

In the mid-1950s, Bob Pettit (above, right) took the torch from Dolph Schayes as the NBA’s premier power forward. The 6-foot-9 Pettit starred for the Milwaukee-St. Louis Hawks between 1954 and 1965 as a devastating interior scorer and rebounder. At the time of his retirement, Pettit had amassed <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pettibo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,880 career points</a>, which were then a record. In his sophomore season, Pettit topped the league in both points scored and rebounds, with 1,849 and 1,164, respectively. In 1961, this power forward averaged a remarkable 28 points, 20 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. A star among stars, Petit was to bring home one <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/pettit_summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA championship</a> to St. Louis in 1958 and claim a record four NBA All-Star Game MVP trophies.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Charles Barkley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690450" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-690450" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/96653246.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="756" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Charles Barkley was never a role model. Instead, he played the game of basketball with reckless, unapologetic abandon.

At 6-foot-4, the short and husky power forward would crash the defensive boards, control the basketball, and turn upcourt with a full head of steam. With opponents refusing to take the charge, the Round Mound of Rebound would take a direct path to the basket and lift off for his trademark gorilla dunk. As a playmaker on the open floor, Barkley also averaged 4 assists per game throughout his career. In half-court sets, Sir Charles put his wide frame and explosiveness to work to clear space and put the ball in the hole. Always in attack mode, Barkley was a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barklch01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stat sheet stuffer</a> who compiled 23,757 points, 12,546 rebounds, 4,215 assists, 1,648 steals, 888 blocks, and one MVP award in his 16 NBA seasons.

Contrary to his rumblings against The Decision and the ring chasing of the Miami Heat superteam of LeBron James, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade, Barkley also made moves to improve his chances for NBA title glory. After Philadelphia, <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-06-18/sports/9202150121_1_charles-barkley-lynam-trade-talks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles was traded</a> to Phoenix in 1992 for a pupu platter of Jeff Hornacek, Andre Lang, and Tim Perry. As a Sun, however, Barkley’s championship dreams were again held at bay by the great Michael Jordan. From there, Sir Charles moved on to Houston, where he would join forces with Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and, eventually, Scottie Pippen. Past their respective primes, the Houston Dream Team was unable to bring more rings back to Clutch City. In 2000, Charles Barkley walked away from basketball, but not before unleashing one last classic put-back.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Karl Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690452" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-690452" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/587353.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="505" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Karl Malone dominated the paint at power forward. At 6-foot-9 and 250 pounds of solid muscle, and as the franchise player for the Utah Jazz, The Mailman always delivered — in the regular season. In the post, Malone walled off hapless defenders on his backside before going up strong at the rim to finish for an easy 2. In transition, Malone could get out on the break, run the floor, and finish with his trademark prettyboy dunk to fire up the crowd in Salt Lake City. Over the course of his 19-year career, The Mailman rarely missed a game, claimed back-to-back MVP honors, and finished second to Kareem Abdul-Jabaar in points scored <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 36,928</a>.

For Utah, Stockton to Malone was the order of the day, as the duo would pick-and-roll the competition to death. Stockton to Malone on the roll for the jam. He feeds Malone on the pick-and-pop for the 15-foot jumpshot. Then, Stockton curls off the Malone screen and rises up for the 3-ball behind the arc.

Despite his regular season success, Malone often degenerated to mush beneath the bright-light glare of playoff basketball. Jazz fans will remain forever haunted by images of Michael Jordan stripping a wide-eyed Malone beneath the basket before turning around to nail a dagger jumper in Bryon Russell’s face on the following possession. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUwDIn7TL_Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 1998</a>, it was the Chicago Bulls who walked off the Delta Center floor as champions.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Elvin Hayes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683435" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="wp-image-683435" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/173417968.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="758" height="505" /> Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]

At power forward, Elvin Hayes (third from right, above) was a pure scorer, and as a rookie in 1968, Big E led the league in scoring as he dropped 28 points and 17 boards a game for the San Diego Rockets. A tough rebounder, Hayes also led the NBA in boards in 1970 and 1974. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hayesel01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For his career</a>, he tallied 27,313 points and 16,279 rebounds on 50,000 minutes played. A winner, Hayes teamed up with center Wes Unseld to make three NBA Finals appearances with the Washington Bullets. In 1978, Hayes helped to finally bring championship hardware to the Capitol.

Classic Elvin Hayes would pin his man on his backside on the baseline before receiving a lob entry pass. From there, the Big E faked a pivot move to create space for his patented turnaround jumper. On the turnaround, Hayes sprung off the floor with perfect form to knock down the shot from 15 feet. Hayes was automatic.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683441" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683441" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450690042.jpg" alt="NBA: The 10 Best Power Forwards to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="516" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Tim Duncan was so good for so long that it is almost boring. The Big Fundamental played basketball as if he were an accountant preparing to file tax returns, making decisive, economical movements in the post or out on the floor, away from the basket, to move the rock and create buckets. Offensively, Duncan combined the technical proficiency of Kevin McHale with the lateral quickness of mentor David Robinson. As a face-up threat, Duncan was still dangerous on the wings through his entire career, where he can go glass and bank in jumpers from 18 feet and in. Defensively, he was a rangy athlete who could smother and harass players from all three positions into mistakes. In 2002, Duncan put it all together to slap together 25/13/4 alongside 2.5 blocks per game to take home <a href="http://www.nba.com/news/duncan_mvp_030504.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVP honors</a>.

As the stoic leader of a dynasty in a military town, Duncan quietly went about his business to lay claim to five NBA championships as the face of the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/6/16/5813384/spurs-five-nba-championships-history-tim-duncan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Antonio Spurs</a>, and he stands as the greatest NBA power forward of all time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_691029" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691029" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/354558-e1409157468451.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

An elite center is the ultimate building block of any NBA franchise. With a dominant big man, teams can control the paint at both ends of the floor. They win closely contested playoff battles, and ultimately <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/more-rings-are-better-the-13-most-successful-nba-players-ever.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring home championships</a>. The game of basketball is stacked with center lore: Bill Russell blocking shots to himself; Bill Walton throwing outlet passes; Kareem’s skyhook; and Shaquille O’Neal tearing down the basket support on a tomahawk jam.

Offensively, the greatest NBA centers of all time were unstoppable on the low block. A skilled center would establish his position in the post, pin you, and receive a lob entry pass for the easy score. With an unreal combination of size, speed, and agility, each center could reach into his bag of tricks to wheel and deal.

At the other end of the floor, the greats were all intimidating rebounders and shot blockers. The ultimate enforcer, a great center would perfect the no-layup rule. He'd either swat your shot into the stands or knock you on your backside. When it all came together, the big man would be rewarded for his tough defense with a sweet pass that leads to yet another rim-rocking dunk. Here’s our list of 10 great NBA centers of all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Bill Walton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758698" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758698" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bill-Walton-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Bill Walton acknowledges his Celtics fans." width="757" height="543" /> Bill Walton acknowledges his Celtics fans. | Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

Bill Walton in his own unorthodox, hippie way, was the ultimate winner. During his time with the UCLA Bruins, Walton brought two consecutive national championships to Westwood to finish off <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/bill-walton-21259731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back-to-back 30-0 seasons</a>. From there, the Portland Trailblazers selected Walton as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. At the NBA level, the Grateful Dead’s biggest fan went on to win one championship each with the Blazers and Boston Celtics in 1977 and 1986, respectively.

A tragic hero, Walton’s litany of complicated foot and ankle injuries sabotaged his star-crossed career. He had apparently meager career averages of 13 points and 10 boards per game. But Walton was, at his best, one of the most technically proficient centers of all time. He could play the angles to knock down outside shots and lay in the ball.

As an unselfish gamer, Walton was a master of both the outlet to ignite the break and interior passing from the low block to get his teammates involved. In 1977, Walton dropped <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/waltobi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19 points per game</a>. He also led the league in rebounding (14) and shot blocking (3.2) averages. In 1978, he put up similar numbers to go alongside 5 assists per game and a league MVP trophy.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>9. Patrick Ewing</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691024" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691024 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51967402-e1409157094807.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="517" /> Mark D. Phillips/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Patrick Ewing was drafted with the No. 1 overall pick in the conspiracy-theory-filled 1985 NBA Draft. He descended upon the Big Apple as the savior for the New York Knicks franchise. As a rookie, Ewing did not disappoint; he logged 20 points and nine rebounds per game and received Rookie of the Year honors.

A model of consistency, Ewing rarely missed games during his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/ewingpa01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17-year career</a>. He went on to average 21 and 10 in New York and during brief stints in Seattle and Orlando. In his prime, Ewing was a force. He banged bodies down low for layups and knocked down midrange jumpers. In 1990, he put it all together to start all 82 games and snag 11 boards, 4 blocks, and 29 points per game. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1991_leaders.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That year</a>, Ewing finished third in scoring behind Karl Malone and Michael Jordan.

Ewing, however, could never get past His Airness. He labored as a perpetual bridesmaid. During the heated Bulls-Knicks rivalry of the ’90s, New York always came up just short in the clutch. In 1994, the Knicks exploited the brief window of Jordan’s first retirement to reach the NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets. That battles was best remembered for <a href="http://www.complex.com/sports/2011/04/the-25-biggest-fails-in-nba-playoff-history/john-starks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Starks’s 2-18 shooting in Game 7</a>. As a subplot to Starks’s ice-cold streak, Ewing was thoroughly outplayed by Houston’s Hakeem Olajuwon.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. George Mikan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685421" align="aligncenter" width="427"]<img class="wp-image-685421 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/George-Mikan-PSA-Card-Facts.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="717" /> Source: PSACardFacts[/caption]

The original game-changing NBA superstar, George Mikan was a giant in the 1950s. At 6-foot-10, the bespectacled one stood beneath the basket to swat away opposing players' jump shots. As a professional, playing for the Minneapolis Lakers, Mr. Basketball simply camped out near the rim and knocked down hook shots to destroy the competition.

At the other end of the floor, opposing coaches ordered their teams to play keep away on offense for long stretches of game time. To speed up the action and limit <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/mikan_bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikan’s impact on the game</a>, the NBA began enforcing goaltending violations. The league also installed the 24-second shot clock and built out a wider three-second lane.

Mikan’s statistical dominance of his era is similar to that of football’s Don Hutson. Between <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mikange01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1948 and 1951</a>, this gentle giant led the league in scoring with averages of at least 27 points per game. In each of these seasons, only two other players averaged more than 20 a game.

<h2>7. David Robinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691020" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-691020 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51994571-e1409156869922.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="601" /> Doug Collier/Getty Images[/caption]

Mr. Robinson (above, left) was almost too nice for his own neighborhood, but at 7-foot-1 and 235 pounds, San Antonio’s No. 50 was a physical specimen who could post up, knock down open jump shots, and even put the ball on the floor. The Admiral was especially dangerous in space, where he would assume the triple-threat stance.

Out of the triple threat, Robinson rose up for a midrange jumper or drove past lumbering stiffs for easy dunks. As an offensive force, Robinson averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21 points per game</a> over his 14-year career. This time peaked with his scoring title in 1994, when he dropped 30 points per game. In the final game that season, Robinson torched the Los Angeles Clippers for 71 points, clinching the scoring title over Shaquille O’Neal.

<a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/robinson_summary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 1995</a>, Mr. Robinson claimed MVP honors when he dropped 28 per game and led the league in total rebounding with an even 1,000. Hakeem Olajuwon, however, thoroughly exposed Robinson's lack of a killer instinct during the 1995 Western Conference Finals. In those playoffs, an agitated Olajuwon destroyed Robinson, averaging 35 points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 blocks.

In 1998, the San Antonio Spurs found Robinson some help when they brought in power forward Tim Duncan from Wake Forest. From there, the twin towers and the Spurs dynasty were born. As part of an imposing front line, Robinson teamed up with the greatest power forward of all time. They brought two NBA championships to San Antonio in 1999 and 2003.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Moses Malone</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682828" align="aligncenter" width="437"]<img class="wp-image-682828" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52032066.jpg" alt="" width="437" height="724" /> Mark Philips/Getty Images[/caption]

Moses Malone was a workhorse. He came straight out of high school to log 21 seasons between 10 different teams in the NBA and ABA. Statistically, the numbers were staggering. Malone <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonmo01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished his career</a> with 29,580 points, 17,834 total rebounds, 9,018 free-throw conversions, and 1,889 blocks. In terms of accolades, Malone made 13 All-Star appearances and won three MVP honors. As an NBA champion, he was the missing link to a talented 1983 Philadelphia 76ers ball club that included Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and Andrew Toney.

For big men, Malone is the gold standard for the 20 and 10 double-double club. A ferocious rebounder, Malone led the league in total boards through five different seasons. At center, he was especially effective on the offensive glass. He was always in the right place at the right time to anticipate shot angles and caroms. Malone led his league in offensive rebounding during nine separate seasons. He was a banger who topped the NBA in free-throw attempts five times. At the charity stripe, he knocked down free throws at a 76% clip throughout his career.

<h2>5. Hakeem Olajuwon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691011" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-691011 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52033665-e1409156399955.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="508" /> Bob Strong/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Absolutely unstoppable, Hakeem Olajuwon (above, left) dominated all comers during his 18-year career, from an overmatched Patrick Ewing to a bamboozled David Robinson, as well as a young Shaquille O’Neal. A point guard trapped in a center’s body, Hakeem Olajuwon used his natural agility, speed, and explosiveness to school plodding opponents in the post.

With his Dream Shake, Olajuwon had moves upon moves: he could put the ball on the floor, cross over, spin, shake, and fake you into oblivion before dropping an easy deuce on your head. With <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/olajuwon_bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995</a>, Hakeem Olajuwon helped put the “clutch” in Clutch City for the Rockets.

Defensively, Olajuwon’s bag of tricks was equally as impressive. In 1990, he starred as the league’s top rebounder and shot blocker. For a big man, Olajuwon patrolled the frontcourt with catlike instincts to steal the basketball. In terms of his total body of defensive work, Olajuwon finished his career atop the all-time blocks list with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/blk_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3,830 total rejections</a> and ninth best in steals, with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/stl_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2,162 career swipes</a>.

In one of the greatest athletic sequences of all time, The Dream abused David Robinson in the 1995 Western Conference Finals. From the baseline, the 7-foot Olajuwon faced up Robinson and went between the legs before shimmying into another crossover and spin move. On the low block, Olajuwon wheeled and up-faked twice to lift the Admiral off his feet before laying up the basketball.

<h2>4. Shaquille O’Neal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691008" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691008 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52011694-e1409156258999.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="639" /> Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Shaquille O’Neal was a beast. Standing at 7-foot-1 and weighing in at 325 pounds, Shaq was one of the largest men to ever pick up a basketball. Contrary to his peers like Gheorghe Muresan, Mark Eaton, and Manute Bol, however, The Diesel actually had the talent to do something beyond “be big.” An unreal combination of size and explosiveness, prime Shaq would devastate defenders with his deep post positioning, quick drop steps, and earth-shattering dunks that would tear down the goal. A man amongst boys, the opposition had no answer for Shaq other than to double team, flop, scratch, claw, put him on the line, and hope for the best.

In Orlando, a young Shaquille teamed up with Penny Hardaway to beat back a No. 45 Michael Jordan and lead the Magic to the big 1995 Finals stage versus the Houston Rockets. The young Magic team, however, was schooled, swept, and spanked by Hakeem Olajuwon and his Clutch City Houston squad. After the loss, Shaq had grown too big for his britches, talked his way out of town, and hopped onto the next flight bound for Hollywood.

With the Los Angeles Lakers, O’Neal joined forces with Phil Jackson and sidekick du jour Kobe Bryant to claim <a href="http://www.nba.com/2013/history/05/17/2002-los-angeles-lakers-three-peat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three consecutive titles</a> and Finals MVP trophies between 2000 and 2002. In Los Angeles, Shaq was at his best, as he finally began to play with an insatiable hunger behind the motivational tactics of the great Zen Master. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2000</a>, Shaq dropped 30, snagged 14 boards, collected 4 assists, and blocked 3 shots per game. In Los Angeles, though, simply winning without drama was never enough. After a contentious feud with Bryant, O’Neal was shown the door and forced to accept a one-way ticket to Miami, where he was still able to lay claim to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260620006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2006 NBA championship</a> while playing Robin to Dwyane Wade’s Batman. Shaq spent the twilight of his career as an unabashed ring chaser, spending time in Phoenix, Cleveland, and Boston.

<h2>3. Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682941" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682941 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/109136617-640x443.jpg" alt="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" width="757" height="524" /> Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images[/caption]

The NBA’s definition of a winner at center... Bill Russell was the focal point of a Boston Celtics dynasty that won <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/russell_bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 NBA championships</a> during his 13-year career. The undisputed leader of stacked ball clubs, which included the likes of Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Tom Heinsohn, Sam Jones, and John Havlicek. For three seasons, one of the greatest centers of all time doubled as a player-coach. He was responsible for doling out minutes, plotting strategy, and managing a group of headstrong personalities.

Russell revolutionized the concept of team defense. Because of his speed and athleticism, Russell could leave his man as a help defender, protect the rim, and secure the basketball. With the basketball in his control, he would outlet to The Cooz and then head off to the races in Boston’s high-octane fast-break offense. This scene repeated itself often, as Russell starred as the NBA’s top rebounder through four separate seasons. Remarkably, Russell completed his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">13-year career</a> with 21,620 total rebounds, which calculates out to 22 rebounds per game.

Russell and his stoic demeanor were the perfect contrast to the flash of prolific scorer Wilt Chamberlain. In their numerous clashes, Russ often prevailed as the victor. He became the one man who could claim Chamberlain’s number.

<h2>2. Kareem Abdul-Jabaar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691018" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691018 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1137370-e1409156639174.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (above, far right) is that rare athlete whose career body of work actually exceeded the outlandish hype. A schoolboy legend, the player then-named Lew Alcindor led his Power Memorial Academy to three consecutive New York City Catholic School Championships and a <a href="http://www.psacard.com/autographfacts/AutographDetail/49/kareem-abdul-jabbar-lew-alcindor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">79-2 record</a>. In college, Alcindor took home three national championships and served as the original building block for the UCLA 88-win dynasty. In the professional ranks, he earned championship hardware for the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks before changing his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and moving on to Los Angeles. As a Laker, Abdul-Jabbar was to establish a formidable one-two punch with Magic Johnson and bring home five more NBA titles.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all-time NBA scoring leader with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">38,387 total points</a>. Classic Kareem would receive the post-entry pass from Magic Johnson on the left block. From there, he would pound the basketball for two counts before rising up and pushing off his left leg. His 7-foot frame and right arm extended, Kareem would then sweep a skyhook into the net from 15 feet away from the basket — the most devastating shot in NBA history.

<h2>1. Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682947" align="aligncenter" width="521"]<img class="wp-image-682947 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/140109368.jpg" alt="" width="521" height="710" /> Wen Roberts/Getty Images[/caption]

Wilt Chamberlain (above, center) is the greatest NBA center of all time by our account, as The Stilt’s mastery of the game and statistical output were comparable to a video game character. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For his career</a>, Chamberlain averaged 30 points and 23 rebounds per game, including a 1962 season for the Philadelphia Warriors, during which the Big Dipper slapped up 50 points and snagged 26 boards per contest. At his peak, Chamberlain took home seven straight scoring titles.

Scoring shouldn’t overshadow Wilt’s excellence as a 7-foot playmaker, and in 1967 and 1968, Chamberlain padded his stats even further, dishing out 8 and 9 assists per game, respectively. The astronomical production, however, was a double-edged sword, as the same questions dogged him throughout his career: Did Wilt Chamberlain care about winning, or was he only concerned with racking up statistics and looking pretty?

Although Chamberlain was often on the losing end of the Bill Russell war, The Stilt did not enter battle with the likes of Bob Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, and John Havlicek as teammates. As a winner, Chamberlain did take home two NBA championships, with the 1967 Philadelphia 76ers and 1972 Los Angeles Lakers. With the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/chamberlain_bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1972 Lakers</a>, The Stilt joined forces with a Dream Team lineup of Gail Goodrich, Jerry West, and Elgin Baylor to win a then-record 69 regular-season games. An elder statesmen on a stacked squad, Chamberlain collected Finals MVP honors on the strength of his 24-point, 29-rebound <a href="http://www.complex.com/sports/2013/05/the-25-greatest-playoff-performers-in-nba-history/wilt-chamberlain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game 5 performance</a>. All in all, Wilt Chamberlain got it done.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_505355" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Magic-Johnson-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505355 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Magic-Johnson-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="500" /></a> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

In basketball, an assist is given to a player for a pass that directly leads to a score by a field goal. Generally, point guards tend to earn the most assists of any position due to their primary role as a facilitator of the offense, but there are sometimes exceptions to the rule.

One of the most notable positions, the point forward, has occasionally sprung up over the years when taller, bigger players are also exceptionally gifted with passing and assume a majority of the ball-handling — the best example of this in today’s NBA is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-top-nba-players-ever-rank.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a>, who oscillated between primary ball-handler and main scorer during his tenure with the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

But whether a team is led by a point guard or a point forward, a floor leader is one of the most indispensable members of a basketball team whose ability to control the tempo of a game can mean the difference between winning and losing in a tight game.

In recent years, NBA analysts and fans have noted that the NBA has seen a resurgence in point guard play led by veterans like Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, and Mike Conley — not to mention newer players like Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, and John Wall. But does this new group of pass-first players have what it takes to overcome the greatest passers in NBA history? Here’s a list of the top eight career assist-leaders of all time for a sense of the tall climb these younger players have in front of them if they wish to be among the best ever.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Gary Payton – 8,966 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505354" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Gary-Payton-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505354 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Gary-Payton-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Starting off the list is Gary Payton, nicknamed “The Glove” — a name he acquired after playing lockdown defense on Kevin Johnson in the 1993 Western Conference Finals, which lead to his cousin telling Payton he was ”holding Johnson like a baseball in a glove.” Chosen with the second overall pick in the 1990 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, Payton would soon establish himself as one of the greatest defense point guards to ever play the game, becoming the only point guard to ever win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award.

Payton is also a one-time NBA champion, a nine-time all-star, a nine-time member of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame on September 8, 2013.

Payton is often considered one of the greatest all-around point guards to ever play the game — something that is evidenced by his rank at number eight on the all-time career assists list with 8,966 along with 21,813 points, good for number thirty on the all-time scoring list. Additionally, Payton also ranks number four on the list of career steal leaders with 2,445 — just below Michael Jordan.

<h2>7. Isiah Thomas – 9,061 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505356" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Isiah-Thomas-Michael-E.-Samojeden-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505356 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Isiah-Thomas-Michael-E.-Samojeden-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="493" /></a> Michael E. Samojeden/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Isiah Lord Thomas III, nicknamed “Zeke,” is considered one of the greatest point guards to ever play the game as a member of a championship Detroit Pistons team, nicknamed the “Motor City Bad Boys” for their physically aggressive, defense-oriented group of players. Chosen with the second overall pick in the 1981 NBA Draft, Thomas would earn a bid to the 1982 NBA All-Star Game and would be instrumental in building up the Pistons as championship contenders in the late 1980s.

During a career that spanned from 1981 to 1994 — entirely as a member of the Pistons — Thomas racked up 9,061 career assists en route to two NBA championships, an NBA Finals MVP, and twelve all-star appearances. Thomas was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000 — his first year of eligibility.

<h2>6. Oscar Robertson – 9,887 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505359" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Oscar-Robertson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505359 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Oscar-Robertson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="575" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Oscar Palmer Robertson, nicknamed “The Big O,” is the all-time NBA leader in triple-doubles and was also the only NBA player to ever average a triple-double for an entire season. Drafted with the number one overall pick in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Cincinnati Royals, Robertson played with the Royals from 1960 to 1970 before being traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, where he retired after the 1974 season.

During his career, Robertson was a one-time NBA champion, one-time NBA MVP, and a twelve-time all-star. Robertson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980 and is considered one of the greatest players to ever play the game.

Despite Robertson’s remarkable consistency as a scorer, rebounder, and passer, he still managed to lead the league in assists during seven different seasons. With a career total of 9,887 assists, Robertson ranks sixth on the list of all-time assist leaders and scored over 40 points 77 different times during regular season games.

<h2>5. Magic Johnson – 10,141 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505360" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Magic-Johnson-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505360 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Magic-Johnson-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Los Angeles Laker legend Earvin ”Magic” Johnson, Jr., was chosen with the number one overall pick in the 1979 NBA Draft and remained a Laker for his entire career. An immediate sensation, Johnson was named an All-Star Game starter and led the Lakers to the finals, where he was named NBA Finals MVP after an epic 42 point, 15 rebound, 7 assist, and 3 steal game, making him the only rookie to ever win the Finals MVP.

Johnson would go on to be a five-time NBA champion, three-time NBA Finals MVP, three-time NBA MVP, and be voted to the NBA All-Star game twelve times, among many other accomplishments. Johnson was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.

Unfortunately for Johnson, the problems surrounding his announcement that he had contracted HIV impacted the limitless potential he could have had in the statistical record books. Despite several lost seasons and retirements, not to mention the impact of the illness both physically and emotionally, Johnson still managed to dish out 10,141 career assists, good for number five on the all-time list. And if it weren’t for HIV, he may have come very close to the all-time record for assists — not to mention earning several more championships.

<h2>4. Mark Jackson – 10,334 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505371" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Mark-Jackson-John-Mottern-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505371 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mark-Jackson-John-Mottern-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="758" height="470" /></a> John Mottern/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Recently back in the broadcast booth after enjoying a brief but successful stint as the head coach of a young Golden State Warriors team, Mark Jackson was no slouch as a player himself, as the number four assist leader of all time.

Chosen with the 18th pick in the 1987 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks, he teamed with Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley in the late 1980s and early 1990s before being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers after the 1991-1992 season. From there, Jackson experienced a career as somewhat of a journeyman — albeit a supremely talented one — with stints on the Indiana Pacers (twice), Denver Nuggets, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz, and Houston Rockets.

Beyond the assists and the coaching, Jackson is also notable for prompting a rule change, sometimes referred to as the “Mark Jackson Rule,” in which offensive players are only allowed to back down a defense player with their back-to-the-basket for five seconds before incurring a penalty. This was due to Jackson’s penchant for backing down opposing point guards for a majority of the shot clock. Jackson is also well-known for the use of a tear drop which has become an increasingly popular tool in recent years for smaller guards to shoot over a larger defenders.

<h2>3. Steve Nash – 10,335 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505372" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Steve-Nash-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505372 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Steve-Nash-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

The Most recent active assist leader to wind up on the all time list, Steve Nash was chosen with the fifteenth overall pick by the Phoenix Suns, but struggled with low playing time due to playing behind established point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd.

But after being traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998, Nash’s potential was quickly made apparent as his numbers rose to elite levels before his return to the Suns in 2004, where he put up the best numbers of his career en route to two NBA MVP Awards as the floor general for the fast-paced Suns.

Officially retired after an injury-filled stint with the Los Angeles Lakers that everyone would rather forget, Nash never managed to climb to the very top of the all-time assist leaders, which once seemed very possible. Still, Nash’s 10,335 career assists put him at the number three all-time leader in assists, but for a player that has often been favorably compared to John Stockton, it’s disappointing that injuries prevented Nash from rising to his sky-high potential.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jason Kidd – 12,091 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505373" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Jason-Kidd-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505373 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Jason-Kidd-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Jason Kidd was one of the most balanced players to ever play the game, as a strength in rebounding on top of scoring and passing made him a regular triple-double threat. Selected with the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks, he would go on to earn Rookie of the Year honors before being traded to the Phoenix Suns in 1996, where he would rise to the NBA’s elite. After being traded to the New Jersey Nets in 2001, Kidd would guide the young team towards title contention before returning to the Mavericks once again in 2008 and finally winning his first championship in 2011.

Kidd’s career assist mark of 12,091 puts him 1,757 assists ahead of Jackson and 1,813 assists ahead of the Nash — who was, <a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/steve-nash-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">until his announcement this year</a>, the closest active player on the list. While Nash had been on track to overtake Kidd’s record in previous years, injury woes have made it a long-shot for him to reach Kidd, and it appears that Kidd will remain at number two on the all-time list for the foreseeable future.

Like the No. 1 assist leader on this list, Kidd was also a master pickpocket, with 2,684 steals in his career, good for number two on the all-time list of steal leaders.

<h2>1. John Stockton – 15,806 Career Assists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709733" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709733" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/John-Stockton_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="John Stockton addresses attendees at the Basketball Hall of Fame ceremony." width="757" height="506" /> John Stockton owns multiple unbreakable records. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Considered one of the greatest pure point guards to ever play the game,<strong> </strong>John Stockton was drafted by the Utah Jazz with the sixteenth overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft and played his entire career with the team — a career that spanned nearly two decades, from 1984 to 2003. During that time, Stockton was a ten time all-star, led the league in assists nine times, and led the league in steals twice. Stockton was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.

Stockton’s 15,806 career assists is seen by many sports fans as one of the most untouchable sports records in any sport. His assist record puts him 3,715 assists ahead of Kidd’s total at number two and a whopping 7,282 ahead of Andre Miller — the closest active player on the list. On top of his legendary assist total, Stockton’s steal total — 3,265 — is also good for number one by a huge margin and is possibly even tougher to break than his assist total.

		<description><![CDATA[Last year, in a brutal move, the Miami Heat lost star and free agent Dwyane Wade to the Chicago Bulls. Here are 13 reasons why the 13-year pro did it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_628051" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628051" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DwyaneWadeCharlotteHornetsvMiamiHeatFxicQsJWLPdl.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade stands on the court." width="757" height="473" /> Dwyane Wade, formerly of the Miami Heat, is now with the Chicago Bulls. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Former Miami Heat great Dwyane Wade moved on from the only team he ever knew during his then-13-year NBA career. He helped bring the Heat <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-underdog-won-nba-championship.html/">three NBA championships</a> (2006, 2012, and 2013) and was a key part of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lebron-james-best-teammates-of-all-time.html/">recruiting LeBron James</a> and Chris Bosh to town, which created one of the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-best-big-threes-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic big threes</a> of all time.

There were some great moments from Wade's time with the Heat, but Miami fans will likely remember this move for quite a long time. Let's check out 13 reasons why it really, really stung when Wade left Miami.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. As if LeBron leaving wasn't enough</h2>
[caption id="attachment_635027" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635027" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwyane-Wade_Miami-Heat-and-LeBron-James_Cleveland-Cavaliers.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade talks with LeBron James on the court." width="757" height="505" /> Dwyane Wade talks with LeBron James on the court. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Sorry to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/from-lebron-to-darko-re-ranking-the-2003-nba-drafts-top-10.html/">bring up James again</a>. But he just won a championship with the team he left the Heat for. However, when he departed Miami, it seemed like things would still be okay. It clearly hurt the franchise, but he wasn't the team hero like Wade. When Wade, the man who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-stars-overshadowed-lebron-james.html/">actually got James</a> and Bosh to town in the first place, announced his departure, it hurt on a whole new level.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. The Heat tried to find middle ground</h2>
[caption id="attachment_622975" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-622975" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Fred-Hoiberg-Chicago-Bulls.jpg" alt="Fred Hoiberg, head coach of the Chicago Bulls, argues a call." width="757" height="541" /> Fred Hoiberg, head coach of the Chicago Bulls, argues a call. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

According to Zach Harper of <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/reports-heats-initial-offer-angered-dwyane-wade-four-teams-pursuing-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sports</a>, the Heat's original offer to Wade was far, far too low, at around $10 million annually. While that obviously wouldn't work in any form or fashion, the Heat tried to find a middle ground with their former star. They elevated their offer to around $20 million a year, according to Brian Windhorst of <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16794599/dwyane-wade-wants-50m-two-years-leaving-miami-heat-offer-short" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>.

The problem was, Wade wanted $25 million annually, not $20 million, which meant that the Heat still came up short. But, did they really? Matt Moore of <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/denver-nuggets-make-reported-52-million-offer-for-dwyane-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sports</a> reported that the Denver Nuggets' offer to Wade was $52 million over two years. Instead of accepting that deal with Denver for $26 million annually, he accepted a $47.5 million offer (less than his asking) with the Bulls. It seems like the Heat franchise and Wade were close, but they probably could have gotten a bit closer.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Only a $7.5 million difference?</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639255" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639255" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwyane-Wade-Rob-FoldyGetty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade looks on during a game against the Pelicans. " width="757" height="546" /> Dwyane Wade looks on during a game against the Pelicans. | Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

This probably makes things even tougher for the Heat fans to swallow. The franchise was so close to Wade returning, but it seems like his mind was elsewhere -- on his hometown, Chicago, to be specific. The money may have been <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-richest-american-sports-team-owners.html/">an issue on the surface</a>, but it's hard to believe that a player who's done so much for a team -- and a team that's meant so much to a player -- couldn't put their heads together to find a way to figure it out.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Wade proved that it was about the money and Chi-town, not the legacy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_605143" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-605143" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Dwyane-Wade-Chris-Bosh-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade (L) and former teammate Chris Bosh hug." width="757" height="530" /> Dwyane Wade (L) and former teammate Chris Bosh hug. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Wade was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-legends-whose-sons-will-become-second-generation-nba-players.html/">born in Chicago</a>, and we all understand that. But it doesn't change the fact that he had built a legacy, a following, and an entire life with the Miami Heat. Instead of sticking with his team and the franchise he spent his entire career with thus far, it was the money and Chicago that pushed him to leave town.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Wade said he wanted to finish his career in Miami</h2>
[caption id="attachment_615053" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-615053" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dwyane-Wade-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade shoots a free throw. " width="757" height="507" /> Dwyane Wade shoots a free throw. | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

This comment Wade made to Barry Jackson of the <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/sports-buzz/2016/02/wade-explains-free-agent-approach-this-summer-dolphins-heat-marlins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami Herald</a> sums up what we all originally thought about Wade's professional aspirations:
<blockquote>The whole free agency thing, I didn't want to be in it last summer; I don't want to be in it this summer, I don't want to be on the market at all…. I’m not curious at all. I want to get to it [with the Heat]. I want to be able to sign my deal and move on and not have to deal with any rumors, any free agency, any this, any that. This is where I want to end my career. So we'll figure it out.</blockquote>
Ouch, Miami.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Title contenders? Not Chicago, and no longer Miami</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628056 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/HassanWhitesideDetroitPistonsvMiamiHeatd8Hs4GVANQKl.jpg" alt="Hassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat looks at the basket." width="757" height="500" /> Hassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat looks at the basket. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Chicago <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-teams-that-started-well-but-missed-the-playoffs.html/">isn't a serious contender</a> in 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 and probably won't be in 2017–18, either. If Wade wanted another title, it's not coming in Chicago. Did he have a chance to win a fourth championship with the Heat? Well, if the team was able to re-sign Hassan Whiteside (which they did), still had Goran Dragic (they do), and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/expensive-contracts-nba-history.html/">could get a healthy Bosh</a>, then they had a serious chance to make it in the East. Now, it looks like Wade's title chances are all but finished, and so are Miami's, thanks to his decision in free agency.

<h2>7. Chicago may be home, but Miami was still "home" too</h2>
[caption id="attachment_626642" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-626642" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Miami-Florida-Skyline.jpg" alt="The skyline of Miami" width="757" height="519" /> The skyline of Miami | Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

This isn't to say that Chicago isn't Wade's actual home. But there's a phrase "second home" for a reason -- and that was the situation with Wade and Miami. The town embraced him, loved him, and cared about him. He also loved Miami, but in the end, he chose to set the city and the team back with his priorities.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. 34-year-old Wade now part of a rebuild</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553037" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553037 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rajon-Rondo-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1438872527220.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade's new teammate Rajon Rondo watches from the bench." width="757" height="505" /> Dwyane Wade's new teammate Rajon Rondo watches from the bench. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Wade is at a point in his career where, if he wants titles, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/vegas-picking-win-2017-nba-championship.html/">needs to join a contender</a>. Instead of staying with the contender he built in Miami (whether some people believe it or not), he chose a rebuild team. Like it or not, Chicago, the Bulls aren't on the fringe of a championship. They may be able to make the playoffs next season, but they aren't winning a championship -- and that may twist the knife in Miami's back even further.

<h2>9. Pat Riley pulled as many strings as possible</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539730" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-539730 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Dwyane-Wade-and-Pat-Riley-e1433339935250.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade (L) and President of the Miami Heat, Pat Riley, discuss strategy. " width="757" height="505" /> Dwyane Wade (L) and President of the Miami Heat, Pat Riley, discuss strategy. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

When the idea of landing both James and Bosh to play alongside of Wade came up, President of the Miami Heat, Pat Riley, did everything in his power to make it happen. In the end, he did just that. The Heat pulled strings; they worked for Wade. Riley originally got <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> to make sure that Wade had a running partner who could really give that team a chance to win a title. Then, came the James/Bosh duo. It's sad that it all came to an end, especially after Riley worked so hard, specifically for Wade.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Riley literally loved Wade</h2>
[caption id="attachment_615101" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-615101" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pat-Riley.jpg" alt="Pat Riley of the Miami Heat smiles during a media conference. " width="757" height="535" /> Pat Riley of the Miami Heat smiles during a media conference. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

In the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/dan-le-batard/article88135197.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami Herald</a>, Dan Le Batard published the text message Riley sent after Wade chose to sign with the Bulls. It was pretty intense, to say the least:
<blockquote>SADDDDDDD!!!! SO saddddddd! I will never forget the sixth game in Dallas in 2006. DW rebounded the ball, and threw it to the heavens and the Heat universe was perfect for that moment. Our first world championship. Our universe is not perfect today. It will be fraught with anger, judgment, blame instead of THANK YOU!!! Ten years ago. Ten years older. Ten years wiser. Ten years changed. All of us. Dwyane had a choice, and he made it. He went home. Bad, bad summer for us. But there will be another 10 years, and it will be someone or something else in 2026. Move on with no blood or tears. Just thanks. I truly loved Dwyane, but families grow, change and get on with another life. He will always be a part of us. ALWAYS! And no more bruises and enough fighting. Let’s just fly above it if we can and never forget. I feel his pain and pride for what pushed him over the ledge. Been there. Forever, for always, your coach I will be. FOREVER!”</blockquote>
That's love. Like, real love.

<h2>11. Wade said leaving was the "right choice"</h2>
[caption id="attachment_558316" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-558316 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dwyane-Wade-Jeff-Schear-Getty-Images-for-Michigan-Avenue-Magazine.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade smiles during a charity event." width="757" height="465" /> Dwyane Wade smiles during a charity event. | Jeff Schear/Getty Images for Michigan Avenue Magazine[/caption]

There are many reports and stories surrounding Wade right now, but when diehard Heat fans hear that he made the "right choice," they probably flinch. Wade's 13-year career with the Heat wasn't enough for him to believe remaining with the franchise was the right choice. Instead, he said just the opposite in a letter to the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16843473/dwyane-wade-writes-letter-miami-leaving-heat-chicago-bulls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press per ESPN</a>. One part read, "This was not an easy decision, but I feel I have made the right choice." We know it wasn't easy, but it's a safe bet that Miami doesn't agree.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>12. A legacy like Kobe Bryant's</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584086" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584086" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Kobe-Bryant-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant acknowledges his fans." width="757" height="537" /> Kobe Bryant acknowledges his fans. | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

It's not normal anymore for NBA players to stay with one franchise for their entire career. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-all-star-game-the-greatest-starting-lineups-of-all-time.html/">Kobe Bryant</a> is one of the few players who did this, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-los-angeles-lakers-of-all-time.html/">his enduring legacy</a> will never be forgotten. While Wade was a great player, he had the chance to finish his career in the same spot that he started it, without making any pit stops along the way. There's a lot to be said about loyalty and respect. But in the end Wade chose a different route, and it will alter his legacy forever.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>13. Wade fans, so many Wade fans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660748" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660748" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Miami-Heat-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh watch from the Miami sideline." width="757" height="515" /> That's all she wrote for the Miami Heat. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

What can you say about all the Wade fans in Miami? Not just the Heat fans; we're talking specifically the fans who absolutely loved No. 3 and the many jerseys around the stadium, the city, and beyond. Wade was one of the most beloved players in the history of Miami, which makes the breakup 10 times as tough. While he sold out the Heat as a team, the fans were by far the most heartbroken of the bunch. For that, we are truly sorry.

		<description><![CDATA[Chicago's basketball legacy is largely defined by one man, but he's hardly the only great Chicago Bulls player to ever put on the uniform.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Chicago Bulls <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-best-teams-90s-except-bulls.html/">of the '90s</a>, with their six NBA championships, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/">are a cultural institution</a> in the NBA. Michael Jordan, of course, was at the focal point of this movement, willing the team through two threepeats, from 1991 to 1993 and again from 1996 to 1998.

While originally viewed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-conspiracy-theories-surrounding-michael-jordan.html/">as a selfish gunner</a> who treated his teammates as little more than a supporting cast, Jordan learned to trust his teammates with age (and Phil Jackson’s triangle offense) to emerge as a more complete player. For better or for worse, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-games-of-michael-jordans-career.html/">iconic Jordan</a> will always cast a long shadow over the careers of each of the four other Chicago Bulls greats; today, a bronzed statue of Air Jordan taking flight greets visitors to the United Center.
<h2>1. Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_796276" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Vincent-Laforet-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-796276 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Vincent-Laforet-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="575" /></a> Vincent Laforet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Drafted as the third overall pick in the 1984 draft, His Airness immediately went to work eviscerating the competition, averaging 28 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists per game as a rookie.

Little surprise, then, that Air Jordan emerged as an exciting athlete in all of sports in short order, as evidenced by his consecutive scoring titles, slam-dunk championship, all-defensive first team selections, and multimillion-dollar endorsement deals. The Bad Boy Pistons, however, made quick work of the Baby Bulls, knocking Chicago out of the postseason in ’88, ’89, and ’90. At the time, the Pistons would funnel M.J. into the paint, where the likes of Dennis Rodman, Rick Mahorn, and Bill Laimbeer were waiting to dish out hard fouls, in effect daring the flashy Air Jordan to rely upon his teammates.

Jordan would not ditch his reputation as a high-volume scorer that failed to make his teammates better until his 1991 sweep of the Detroit Pistons, setting the stage for when Jordan went on to take Chicago to six nearly consecutive and always successful trips to the Finals.

<h2>2. Scottie Pippen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_796297" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Scottie-Pippen-Al-Bello-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-796297 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Scottie-Pippen-Al-Bello-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /></a> Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Scottie Pippen, in his own right, was one of the greatest all-around performers to play the game of basketball, posting averages of 18 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals per game through 12 years of service with the Chicago Bulls. As an individual performer, Scottie went off for his best season <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1994.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 1994</a>, racking up 22 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per contest, leading the Bulls to the Eastern Conference semifinals while Jordan enjoyed his first retirement and pursued a short-lived baseball career.

In true rags-to-riches form, the Seattle SuperSonics drafted Scottie Pippen with the fifth overall pick in the 1987 draft out of Central Arkansas. On Draft Day, the projected defensive specialist was immediately dealt to the Chicago Bulls. Over time, Pippen added a post game, solid midrange jump shot, and big-game moxie to his arsenal, undoubtedly informed by practices with and against his legendary teammate.

As a duo, Jordan and Pippen were at their best out of the 1-2-1-1 full court press, with Pippen patrolling the midcourt area. After baiting the opposition into a careless mistake, Pippen would control the ball as a point forward, with Jordan racing down the wing.

<h2>3. Jerry Sloan</h2>

In 1978, Jerry Sloan earned the distinction of being the first Chicago Bull to have his jersey retired. Sloan was actually a member of the first 1966 Bulls roster, after being taken from the Baltimore Bullets in the expansion draft. As a Bull, Sloan built his reputation through grit and hustle, which made him a fan favorite in blue-collar Chicago. In 1971, Sloan crashed the boards for 9 rebounds per game, as a 6-foot-5 shooting guard.

In all, Sloan put up 15 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, through 10 seasons with the Chicago Bulls. As a prelude to Jordan-Pippen-Rodman, Sloan teamed up with big man Bob Love and point guard Norm Van Lier to form one of the greatest defensive units of all time from between 1972 and 1976. The 1975 Bulls advanced to the Western Conference finals before going down in seven games to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors, with Sloan, 32, then in the twilight of his career and battling through nagging injuries.

At 37, Sloan was named head coach of the Chicago Bulls prior to the 1979-1980 season. In three regular seasons at the helm, Sloan went 94-121 and coached the team to one playoff appearance, where the Celtics dynasty promptly dismissed the Bulls in a four-game sweep. Sloan will be most remembered for his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q79hZ3v8RiE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23-year coaching tenure in Utah</a>, where the Jazz went 1,127-682 through the regular season and made 19 trips to the playoffs. Sloan, John Stockton, and Karl Malone, however, lost two back-to-back finals to the Chicago Bulls.

<h2>4. Bob Love</h2>

Bobe Love’s jersey now hangs in the rafters at the United Center alongside Jordan, Pippen, and Sloan as the <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/retired_numbers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only numbers to ever be retired</a> for the Chicago Bulls. At 6-foot-8, Love would play both forward positions in Chicago from 1969 to 1976.

As a pure scorer, Love was all but automatic from midrange. In half-court sets, he would often pin his man in the post before rising up for a turnaround jumper in the flow of the offense. To keep defenses honest, Love would sometimes set up shop on the low block, feinting toward a fake entry pass, and running back door for an easy layup.

In Chicago, Love was a three-time All Star and combined with Sloan to form a devastating inside-outside combination that made six consecutive trips to the playoffs through the early ’70s. Love and the Bulls did advance to the Western Conference finals, in 1974 and 1975, losing to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Milwaukee Bucks and Rick Barry’s Golden State Warriors, respectively.

<h2>5. Derrick Rose</h2>
[caption id="attachment_796338" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Derrick-Rose-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-796338 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Derrick-Rose-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="568" /></a> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2008, the Bulls drafted South Side schoolboy legend Derrick Rose with the first overall pick in what appeared to be the beginning of a storybook career. Shortly thereafter, the hometown hero in the making received Rookie of the Year honors, posting 17 points, 4 rebounds, and 6 assists per game. By his third year in the league, Rose had added a serviceable midrange jump shot to his game and was all but unstoppable. In 2011, Rose took home MVP honors, becoming the youngest player to win the award, at just 22.

Rose, however, was to suffer through a series of devastating knee injuries and miss significant playing time between 2012 and 2015. Missing the entire 2012-2013 campaign while needing time to recover from a torn left ACL, a tentative D-Rose was averaging 16 points through 10 games before blowing out his other knee in 2013.

Early in 2015, Chicago held its collective breath when Rose complained of soreness in his same right knee and team doctors confirmed a torn meniscus. This time, however, Rose made a speedy recovery, and was back averaging nearly 20 points per game through the playoffs.

At this junction in time, the jury is still out as to whether Rose can either recover his MVP form or join the NBA’s unceremonious injury could-have-been club, featuring Grant Hill, Brandon Roy, Penny Hardaway and Greg Oden. Chicago Bulls fans, of course, remained hopeful that they would one day also raise Rose’s number up to the United Center rafters in retirement, but he was ultimately traded to the New York Knicks.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_584086" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584086" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Kobe-Bryant-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images-640x454.jpg" alt="Kobe-Bryant-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="537" /> The fans love Kobe Bryant | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

They’re the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-stephen-curry-performances-of-the-season.html">performances that take your breath away</a>. You know the ones we're talking about. The ones where the shooter can't miss; the ones with the big man that can’t be stopped. These are the contests where an individual's point total keeps climbing, forcing you to ask yourself one simple question: How many points is he going to finish with?

As we wait in anticipation what will hopefully be another exciting year of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> basketball, this seems like as good a time as any to take a look back through the record books at some of the most remarkable individuals scoring performances of all time.

With that in mind, here's a breakdown of the 10 highest individual <a href="http://www.landofbasketball.com/records/60_or_more_points.htm" target="_blank">single-game scoring totals</a> in NBA history. Oh, and more than half of them belong to the same man.
<h2>10. Wilt Chamberlain, 70 points (3/10/63)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595266" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595266" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wilt-Chamberlain-Brian-Bahr-Allsport-Getty-Images-640x432.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Wilt Chamberlain has something to say | Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

Only 10 times in NBA history has one man scored at least 70 points in the same game. Usually, that man’s name was Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain kicks off our countdown with a 1963 game between his San Francisco Warriors and the Syracuse Nationals. This was the sixth and final time Chamberlain reached the 70-point plateau, and it came in a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196303100SYR.html" target="_blank">163-148</a> loss, when Chamberlain knocked down 27 shots and connected on 16 free throws .

<h2>8. (tie) Elgin Baylor, 71 points (11/15/60)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_645772" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-645772" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Elgin-Baylor-of-the-Los-Angeles-Lakers-640x413.jpg" alt="NBA legend and former Laker Elgin Baylor acknowledges the crowd upon reception of an award at halftime during the Los Angeles Lakers v Golden State Warriors NBA game at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on November 16, 2014, where the Warriors defeated the Lakers 136-115.

Elgin Baylor scored his career high in 1960, leading the Lakers to a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196011150NYK.html" target="_blank">123-108</a> victory over the Knicks. On this night, November 15, 1960, he made 28 field goals and went 15-19 from the line. At the time, Baylor’s 71-point performance represented the highest single-game total ever, although that mark would be shattered in the coming years as Chamberlain’s career progressed.

<h2>8. (tie) David Robinson, 71 points (4/24/94)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_524591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-524591 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Robinson-Doug-Collier-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="602" /> David Robinson got buckets| DOUG COLLIER/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Spurs center David Robinson edged Shaquille O’Neal for the 1994 scoring title thanks to a <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/features/robinson_71_points.html" target="_blank">71-point outburst</a> -- 26-41 from the field, 18 for 25 from the free throw line -- in the regular season finale, a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199404240LAC.html" target="_blank">112-97</a> win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Robinson finished with an average of 29.8 points per game compared to 29.3 for Shaq, although it took San Antonio <a href="http://blog.mysanantonio.com/spursnation/2014/04/24/the-day-david-robinson-dropped-71/" target="_blank">intentionally fouling</a> with a 20+ point lead down the stretch to get Robinson his last few tallies.

<h2>7. Wilt Chamberlain, 72 points (11/3/62)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708367" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708367" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52034672.jpg" alt="Wen Roberts/Getty Images" width="757" height="524" /> Wilt Chamberlain could not be stopped | Wen Roberts/Getty Images[/caption]

Chamberlain’s dominance was on full display during the 1962 calendar year, as the superstar (pictured later in his career as a member of the Lakers) scored at least 72 points on four different occasions. On this particular occasion, November 3, 1962, Chamberlain's San Francisco Warriors may have dropped the game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196211030LAL.html" target="_blank">127-115</a>  to the Los Angeles Lakers, but Wilt still managed to put up 72 points, courtesy of 29 field goals and 14 free throws. Which begs the question, where’s the supporting cast when you need it?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. (tie) Wilt Chamberlain, 73 points (1/13/62)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xr3i9jpiTE"></iframe>

The biggest thing that jumps out from this box score — since we’re used to Chamberlain pouring in more than 70 in a game at this point — is the names of the teams. Wilt the Stilt’s Warriors were based in Philadelphia at the time, and their opponent was none other than the Chicago Packers. (That sounds like an NFC North mash-up gone wrong, doesn’t it?) The Warriors prevailed, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196201130PHW.html" target="_blank">135-117</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. (tie) Wilt Chamberlain, 73 points (11/16/62)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2TVydtglY8"></iframe>

More vintage Chamberlain from 1962: this time, it was the San Francisco version of the Warriors beating up on the hapless Knicks (they were 3-13 at the time). Final score: <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196211160NYK.html" target="_blank">127-111</a>. Chamberlain would average a ho-hum 44.8 points per game in the 1962–1963 season, which somehow was significantly <em>down</em> from his 50+ average the year before.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. (tie) David Thompson, 73 points (4/9/78)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6OsKy1c5A0"></iframe>

Nuggets star David Thompson scored 73 points in the last game of the 1977–78 season, but it wasn’t enough. Denver came up on the short end of a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197804090DET.html" target="_blank">139-137</a> score against the balanced offensive output of the Detroit Pistons, who had five different players score at least 19 in the game. Thompson made 28 field goals and went 17-20 from the charity stripe in his career night.

<h2>3. Wilt Chamberlain, 78 points (12/8/61)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657725" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657725" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Wilt-Matt-Campbell-AFP-Getty-Images-640x452.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, : NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain is surrounded by media 07 February at a press conference for the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history at the Renaissance Hotel in Cleveland, OH.

The second greatest scoring output of Chamberlain’s ridiculous career came with the aid of triple overtime — as if that makes it less impressive somehow. Wilt’s Warriors fell to Elgin Baylor’s Lakers <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196112080PHW.html" target="_blank">151-147</a>. Imagine what a treat it was for fans to watch that game: 78 points for Chamberlain and, oh, by the way, Baylor <em>only</em> had 63.

<h2>2. Kobe Bryant, 81 points (1/22/06)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_625506" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-625506" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant warms up prior to a game against the Pelicans. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Kobe Bryant warms up prior to a game against the Pelicans. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

Kobe Bryant led the NBA in scoring in 2005–2006 at more than 35 points per game, but he entered a completely different and otherworldly zone on January 22 against the Toronto Raptors. Kobe put up 55 points after halftime, rallying the Lakers from an 18-point second-half deficit in a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200601220LAL.html" target="_blank">122-104</a> victory. Bryant’s final stat line: 81 points on 28-46 shooting. He was also 18-20 from the foul line. Kobe had flirted with history a month earlier, scoring 62 points in just three quarters <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200512200LAL.html" target="_blank">against the Mavericks</a>, but he sat out the final period of that game with a big lead. Against Toronto, LA needed the points — and Bryant delivered.

<h2>1. Wilt Chamberlain, 100 points (3/2/62)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxMeEzhvNRs"></iframe>

As a society, we’re fascinated with round numbers. No one celebrates Peyton Manning throwing his 487th touchdown or Tom Brady accumulating 47,000 passing yards. The ones that matter are No. 500, No. 50,000, etc. So how perfect is it that the only time an NBA player ever scored 82 or more points in a game, he finished with a perfect 100? You know the story: playing in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain delivered a sweet performance — 36 baskets, 28 field goals, and 100 points (even if it took <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22748484/35060192/4" target="_blank">63 field goal attempts</a> to get there), <a href="http://www.nba.com/sixers/news/wilt_boxscore.html" target="_blank">25 rebounds</a>, and a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/196203020NYK.html" target="_blank">169-147 </a>win for the Warriors over New York.

		<description><![CDATA[The 2017 NBA Slam Dunk Contest is just a few days away. What are some of the greatest dunks in the history of this event?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_746781" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-746781" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Michael-Jordan-7.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls dunks the ball." width="500" height="750" /> Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls dunks the ball during the game against the Miami Heat | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the most exciting parts of NBA All-Star Weekend is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-dunkers-in-nba-history.html/">Slam Dunk Contest</a>. This contest has it all: inventiveness, competition, and pure athleticism. The players who participate in this event are there for one reason, and that’s to put on a show.  And, while having fun watching the best of their best ply their trade against each other is the major reason why anyone watches professional sports, there's something singularly special about the slam dunk, and by extension, the slam dunk contest.

For us, these are 10 best dunks in the history of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.
<h2>10. Spud Webb soars off one bounce</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H5wBI98NXEE"></iframe>
Under today’s standards, maybe this dunk wouldn’t bring down the house. However, you have to think about the moment. It’s 1986, and 5-foot-7 Spud Webb is not only putting on a show, but he’s challenging his teammate and defending champ Dominique Wilkins, one of the most dynamic dunkers of all time. Spud is throwing down impressive stuff. However, this final number won him the title.

The “little man" bounces the rock, flies into the air (high into the air), grabs the ball, and flushes a nasty reverse slam. Everyone in the place erupts. That’s how you do it.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Andre Iguodala goes behind the back</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ntx2FbcWDxs"></iframe>
Andre Iguodala got robbed in the 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Contest (the title ended up going to the tiny and electric Nate Robinson). However, it was Iguodala who put in the more phenomenal display that night. This left-t0-right, behind-the-back jam started things off. The fact that he cradled the ball off the bounce with his left hand, then brought it around his back, only to flush it with the right is what makes this play so ridiculous. It’s the kind of play that makes you go, “Oooh!"

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Jason Richardson does the “East Bay Funk Dunk" 2.0</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ygk2JfqOolM"></iframe>
Jason Richardson is one of the best participants in dunk contest history. Not only did he win two contests back to back, but he always managed to electrify the crowd with his originality and his athleticism. This dunk, in the 2004 competition, represents that perfectly. Richardson chucks the ball off the backboard, catches it in mid-air, puts it between his legs, and throws it down with crazy authority. This dunk was super funky and a great way to improve on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEhVqvi7V2w" target="_blank">classic</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Vince Carter puts it through his legs</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jujjs5Qnit8"></iframe>
Vince Carter is dunking royalty. He jams with purpose and he’s always prepared to put on a show for the audience. In 2000, when he won the title, Carter may have exhibited the best collection of dunks by one dunker in a single contest. This one was crazy.

Carter manages to put it between his legs and throw down a vicious slam. However, he does this only after he catches the ball off the bounce. That is Vin-sanity! Even teammate Tracy McGrady, who threw the bounce pass, doesn’t know how to react to this epic display. However, Carter knew that this was going to be his night. His “it’s over" signal after the dunk should’ve been a message to all the other contests: Just pack up and go home, this one’s in the bag.

<h2>6. DeMar DeRozan introduces the “Show Stopper"</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8HPvkBGtHPc"></iframe>
This dunk by Toronto Raptor DeMar DeRozan, in the 2011 contest, was absolutely filthy. There’s really no other way to characterize this slam. Just take a look.

DeRozan lobs the ball towards the basket, cups it in the air, and fluidly manages to bring his body under the rim and throw it down reverse-style. It happens so quickly that at first, it’s hard to really appreciate how amazing it is. However, the slow-motion version shows you how truly absurd DeRozan’s hang time was on this slam. Wow.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Jason Richardson’s between-the-legs baseline jam</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PejeH1uzDJs"></iframe>

Jason Richardson was so good that we had to put him here twice. j-Rich has pulled off some incredible jams during his reign as slam dunk king. There really are so many to choose from that it’s hard to narrow it down. However, this little number from the 2003 show is our absolute favorite. And it’s more than deserving of cracking the top five.

This dunk won Richardson the 2003 contest, and it’s unbelievable. He lobs the ball from the baseline, catches it, puts it backwards between his legs, and throws down a reverse with the left hand. This dunk has so many nuances to it, it’s ridiculous. That’s why he’s one of the best.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Andre Iguodala’s behind-the-basket reverse</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/w6z9-l4hnMM"></iframe>

This dunk should have won Iguodala the 2006 Slam Dunk Contest. It’s one of the most difficult dunks we’ve ever seen, and we still can’t believe it pulled it off. Every time we watch this dunk, we expect Iggy to hit his head on the bottom of the backboard. But he hangs in the air so long, it’s like he’s flying.

Teammate Allen Iverson, throws the ball off the back of the glass, Iguodala catches it, and in one motion, soars under the basket and slams it with his right hand. Amazing. Commentators wanted them to give Iguodala the trophy right then and there. And, you know what, they should have.

<h2>3. Vince Carter with the “Honey Dip"</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/H8BSSCnSYds"></iframe>
Like we said, 2000 was the year of Vince Carter. This dunk is so mind boggling that after Carter threw it down, no one knew how to react. No one. Why? Because they had never seen anything quite like it before. And they probably never will again. Carter got so high on this dunk that he actually hung in the rim by his forearm. The amount of power and explosiveness needed to pull of this dunk is indescribable. Let everyone who witnessed it firsthand describe — we’re speechless.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Michael Jordan flies from the free-throw line</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sUz3ZYfoNxo"></iframe>
This dunk was done before Michael Jordan, and it’s been done after. But, none of them were as iconic as the one that M.J. did in 1988. This is the Air Jordan symbol. This is everything that Jordan was, rolled into one breathtaking moment. Jordan throws down a double-clutch dunk from the free-throw line. It’s powerful and graceful and poetic. It’s timeless.

<h2>1. Vince Carter’s 360 windmill</h2>

Vince Carter started off his 2000 Slam Dunk Contest with sheer authority. This dunk let everyone in the building know that they were about to witness something special. As they said in the clip, “This is a reverse-360 going against the grain." How could he possibly do that? The strength. The extension. The force. Carter could have won with just that dunk alone. That’s why he’s the best this contest has ever seen. And this dunk raised the bar.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Anthony Davis almost became one of the few players in NBA history to record a quadruple-double in a game. Who has made this exclusive list?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_745973" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745973" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Anthony-Davis-640x447.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="529" /> One Brow, almost one quadruple-double | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s getting pretty difficult to come up with new adjectives to adequately describe the freakish talent that is New Orleans Pelican big man Anthony Davis. At just 23 years old, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-breaking-down-anthony-daviss-hall-of-fame-performance.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is simply nothing that this kid cannot do on a basketball court</a>. We have to focus on one Sunday night in particular -- just another example of The Brow flashing his brilliance with another epic performance.

During a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400579276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">118-111 double-overtime loss</a> to the Denver Nuggets last season, Davis still managed to put together a stat line that included 36 points, 14 rebounds, nine blocks, and seven assists. While we’re sure he’d have much rather won the ballgame, it’s impossible not to acknowledge how otherworldly this show was. According to both the Pelicans and the <a href="http://www.esb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, there has never been a player in the history of the sport to put up those kinds of numbers. If you needed any doubt that he was going to be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-summer-olympics-6-athletes-wont.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">missed in Rio</a>, this is it.

In fact, the only thing that he didn’t do during that game was record a quadruple-double. Then again, that hasn’t happened very much in the history of the NBA. While we’re sure that Davis will no doubt challenge this stat line again, let’s take a look at those who have managed to record the elusive quadruple-double.

<h2>1. Nate Thurmond – October 18, 1974</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyPYVp9f4Ag" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stat line</span>: 22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists, 12 blocks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opponent</span>: Atlanta Hawks</li>
</ul>
Hall of Famer <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thurmna01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate Thurmond</a> was a superstar in every sense of the word. He had solid numbers throughout his career and managed to average a double-double, with 15.0 points and 15.0 rebounds per game. He was a seven-time All Star, a consistent member of the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA All-Defensive Team</a>, and was named one of the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_defense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 greatest players in NBA history</a>.

He was also the first player in recorded history to have a quadruple-double, a feat that occurred on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197410180CHI.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 18, 1974</a>, when his <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Bulls</a> took on the Atlanta Hawks. This contest was the first game of the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1975.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1974-1975 season</a> and Thurmond helped lead the Bulls to a 120-105 victory in overtime. With a stat line of 22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists, and 12 blocks, it’s no surprise that Thurmond earned the nickname “Nate the Great."

<h2>2. Alvin Robertson – February 18, 1986</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkSKRRAr4hE" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stat line</span>: 20 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opponent</span>: Phoenix Suns</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberal01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alvin Robertson</a> was a solid shooting guard who was selected to four All-Star Games and won the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/dpoy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1986 NBA Defensive Player of the Year award</a>. At the beginning of his career, Robertson averaged just under 20 points per game, but he left his mark on the league during a February 18, 1986, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198602180SAS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game against the Phoenix Suns</a>. While playing for the San Antonio Spurs, Robertson helped lead his team to a 120-114 victory. His quadruple-double came on 8-17 shooting from the field and 4-6 from the free-throw line. Robertson’s 20 points were not a team high, but his 11 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals put him in a league of his own.

<h2>3. Hakeem Olajuwon – March 3, 1990</h2>
[caption id="attachment_772894" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-772894 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Hakeem-Olajuwon-e1426519622186.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="647" /> Tony Ranzie/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stat line</span>: 29 points, 18 rebounds, 10 assists, 11 blocks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opponent</span>: Golden State Warriors</li>
</ul>
Tw0-time <a href="http://www.landofbasketball.com/championships/year_by_year.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA champion</a> <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/olajuha01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hakeem Olajuwon</a> is the only person in NBA history to record more than one quadruple-double in a game. The first of these impressive performances came on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199003030HOU.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 3, 1990</a>, during a game in which his Houston Rockets demolished the Golden State Warriors 129-109. In this contest, Olajuwon was absolutely dominant, finishing with 29 points, 18 rebounds, 10 assists, and 11 blocks. Not only could he control the post with his fluid footwork, but as you can see from the numbers, The Dream was one of the best passing big men to ever step on the floor. This game was just Hakeem being Hakeem.

<h2>4. Hakeem Olajuwon – March 29, 1990</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691011" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691011" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/52033665-640x429.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /> Bob Strong/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stat line</span>: 18 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists, 11 blocks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opponent</span>: Milwaukee Bucks</li>
</ul>
While Olajuwon’s second quadruple-double wasn’t on par with the first one, the fact that he did it again in the same season makes it all the more impressive. On <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199003290HOU.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 29, 1990</a>, Olajuwon led the Rockets to a victory over the <a href="http://www.nba.com/bucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milwaukee Bucks</a>, putting on a show in the process. Hakeem the Dream was unstoppable, on his way to 18 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists, and 11 blocks. Interestingly enough, this performance came against another member of the quadruple-double club: Alvin Robertson. However, this night was all about the Houston Rockets and their future Hall of Fame center.

<h2>5. David Robinson, February 17, 1994</h2>
[caption id="attachment_691020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-691020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51994571-628x500.jpg" alt="Doug Collier/Getty Images" width="757" height="602" /> Doug Collier/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stat line</span>: 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 blocks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opponent</span>: Detroit Pistons</li>
</ul>
The last recorded quadruple-double was accomplished by the brilliant <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Robinson</a>. The Hall of Fame center put together this magical performance on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199402170SAS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 17, 1994</a>, against the Detroit Pistons, and it was accompanied by a Spurs victory. The Admiral scored 34 points on 12-20 from the field and also tacked on 10 points from the free-throw line. In addition to the points, Robinson recorded 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks, and the Spurs handled the Pistons with ease, 115-96.

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA rumors about potential trades are still flying, but these 5 possible trades wouldn't go over too well with the fans.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[To say that the 2016 NBA season has been exciting is a pretty huge understatement. We've seen <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-kevin-durant-win-73-games.html/" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a> flourish with the Golden State Warriors, a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nba-free-agency-names-landed.html/" target="_blank">ton of huge contracts</a> handed out, and of course, the trade buzz circulating around the media. But it's not over yet. It may not even be close to over, because teams are doing everything in their power to piece together teams and contend

While trades very well may come before the deadline passes, we're going to take a look at six deals that would probably make the fanbases of these teams pretty angry. Whether it's because they don't want to see players go or just because losing a specific player would mean their team is likely headed for a lottery pick in 2017, these would be horrifying, maddening trades. We'll start things off with Oklahoma City's triple-double touting superstar.
<h2>1. Russell Westbrook to anywhere</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527213" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527213 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Russell-Westbrook_OKC-Thunder-e1429016050777.jpg" alt="NBA Rumors: 5 Trades That Would Piss Off Fans" width="757" height="555" /> Russell Westbrook currently of the Oklahoma City Thunder | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

It doesn't even matter where he goes. The Oklahoma City Thunder could <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-landing-spots-russell-westbrook.html/" target="_blank">trade Russell Westbrook</a> to the Philadelphia 76ers, and the fans would probably still lose their minds. For what it's worth, the Thunder diehards would likely be less angry if they traded him now, compared to losing him to free agency next offseason.

Oklahoma City still has an impressive core of players, but Westbrook is the man who puts them in contention. If the Thunder trade Westbrook, they can probably get rid of the idea of contending for a championship for a few seasons. Here's to hoping Westbrook stays in Oklahoma City and proves that this team can still make noise -- without Durant.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_604431" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-604431" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-500708354-Jimmy-Butler-Chicago-Bulls-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA Rumors: 5 Trades That Would Piss Off Fans" width="757" height="505" /> Jimmy Butler of the Chicago Bulls | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

For what it's worth, Butler seems to go on and off the trading block at a whim. Even with that said, the Timberwolves were the team linked with the Chicago Bulls in a potential Butler deal. While there's nothing about the T-Wolves that would really make the Bulls fanbase mad, it's more about the fact that the team just traded Derrick Rose, but had a pretty solid overall offseason, even if things haven't exactly come up roses.

Deciding to move Butler would simply show the entire world that they were in full rebuild mode, instead of trying to get back into the postseason. Here's to hoping nothing changes and the Bulls don't decide to make any trade that moves Butler.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Nerlens Noel out of Philadelphia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_525186" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-525186 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Nerlens-Noel-e1428334199458.jpg" alt="NBA Rumors: 5 Trades That Would Piss Off Fans" width="757" height="504" /> Nerlens Noel of the Philadelphia 76ers | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

There are a few things that would be ridiculous. First off, the 76ers have given up on some young talent in the past, but they should not throw in the towel on Nerlens Noel, especially not over Jahlil Okafor. They should probably hold on to both until they find out if Joel Embiid is actually completely good to go.

According to <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nba/rumors/post/_/id/38231/nba-rumor-central-76ers-actively-shopping-jahlil-okafor-nerlens-noel-others" target="_blank">ESPN's John Wilmhoff</a>, the team is actively shopping both Noel and Okafor. From what we can gather, fans are fine with Okafor leaving town, but Noel? It's a little confusing. He's improved from one year to the next. While he's not yet a dominant force in the NBA, he has the upside to be one. Noel should be the player who the team is molding to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winners-losers-2016-nba-draft.html/" target="_blank">play alongside of Ben Simmons</a> and the plethora of other young talent there. Just hold on to Noel, and let him continue to grow.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Paul Millsap to the Toronto Raptors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_525473" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-525473" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Atlanta-Hawks-640x432-640x432.jpg" alt="NBA Rumors: 5 Trades That Would Piss Off Fans" width="757" height="511" /> Paul Millsap of the Atlanta Hawks | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

According to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16834452/atlanta-hawks-had-great-plan-get-better-all-went-wrong" target="_blank">ESPN's Zach Lowe</a>, the Atlanta Hawks were prepared not only to let Al Horford go in free agency (for Dwight Howard), but the team was also interested in trading Paul Millsap. Yes, Millsap is set to become a free agent next offseason, and he was the team's best player last season.

To top everything off, <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242746/Hawks-Preferred-Horford-Over-Millsap-In-Part-Due-To-$9M-Difference-In-17-18-Salary" target="_blank">RealGM.com reported</a> the Hawks received trade interest from four teams; Phoenix, Denver, Toronto, and Houston. The issue with Toronto? This team is battling them for the top of the Eastern Conference. If Atlanta moved their best player to one of their biggest competitors, it would send people into a frenzy. Fingers crossed it doesn't happen.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Andrew Wiggins out of Minnesota</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570983" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570983" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrew-Wiggins-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images-640x383.jpg" alt="NBA Rumors: 5 Trades That Would Piss Off Fans" width="757" height="453" /> Andrew Wiggins of the Minnesota Timberwolves | Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

It would be insane for the Timberwolves to move Andrew Wiggins, so the good news is that they likely won't. Wiggins is finally coming into his own, as he averaged 20.7 points per game in 2015. He also increased his shooting percentage and has missed a grand total of just one game in his career.

With Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns, Ricky Rubio, Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine, and their additional young talent, this team has potential (and maybe next season, playoffs) written all over it. Just let the young group continue to improve, and don't move one of your best scorers -- and the player who may become one of the best scorers in the NBA sooner rather than later.

			<title>The 5 Most Elite Ball Handlers in the NBA Today</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Using Isaiah Thomas' article in The Players' Tribune as a reference, here's how we would rank the 5 most elite ball handlers in the NBA.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_860785" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Isaiah-Thomas-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-860785 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Isaiah-Thomas-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Isaiah Thomas dribbles to the basket" width="757" height="560" /></a> Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

The Players’ Tribune is an excellent read if you’re ever interested in seeing the world of sports through the eyes of professional athletes themselves (filtered through their PR representatives, sure, but more informative than the same stock answers you hear recited at every post-game interview and practice). While most of the pieces are cool in their own right, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-takeaways-from-david-ortizs-rant-on-steroids.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">every so often you come across one that warrants a bigger discussion</a>. This happens to be one of those instances.

In an article entitled “<a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/isaiah-thomas-celtics-nba-best-ball-handlers/" target="_blank">Elite Ball Handlers 101</a>" Boston Celtics point guard <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thomais02.html" target="_blank">Isaiah Thomas</a> provided a list of players he believed were the best ball handlers in the <a href="http://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">National Basketball Association</a> and why they’ve made the cut. None of Thomas’ picks are players you wouldn’t expect to find on a list like this — something he makes sure to note — however, it doesn’t provide any kind of ranking. While we always enjoy reading pieces where players describe their peers, we couldn’t help but feel the need to take this concept one step further. If there’s one thing that could take this piece to the next level, it’s a bit of <em>order</em>.

As a result, using the players provided in this article, we’ve decided to rank them based on their ball-handling abilities. We’re sure not everyone is going to agree with our choices, but that’s what makes this so much fun. It’s all about the discussion, after all. Therefore, with that in mind, here’s a look at the five most elite ball handlers in the NBA.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Chris Paul</h2>
[caption id="attachment_860737" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chris-Paul-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-860737 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chris-Paul-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chris Paul dribbles against the Spurs" width="757" height="459" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01.html" target="_blank">Chris Paul</a></span>:
<blockquote>“Since he was on the wrong end of both Steph Curry highlights, let’s give CP3 some love. He’s one of the craftiest guards in the NBA on his own right. He’s not flashy, he just has the right moves to get where he wants to go. He always pulls the right move out at the right time because he’s so smart. He’s a real student of the game."</blockquote>
It’s impossible to deny Thomas’s comments on the <a href="http://www.nba.com/clippers/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Clippers</a> floor general. Paul is smart, crafty, creative, and knows when to turn it on. He is a fierce competitor who wants the ball in his hands come crunch time. And if he’s on your squad, you’d be wise to give it to him — he is known to make things happen. However, since this is a discussion on elite ball handlers as opposed to a conversation about the best overall point guards in the NBA, we don’t think we can put CP3 any higher on this particular list. With that being said, he’s still super dope at dribbling the rock.

<h2>4. James Harden</h2>
[caption id="attachment_860741" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/James-Harden-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-860741 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/James-Harden-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="James Harden drives past Klay Thompson" width="757" height="553" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas on <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3992/james-harden" target="_blank">James Harden</a></span>:
<blockquote>“I don’t know why it’s so hard to guard lefties. I think it’s just because so many guys are right-handed that when you see a lefty, it’s just not normal. But there’s more to James Harden than just being left-handed. He’s creative, shifty and very deceiving.

He has a lot of east and west in his game. A lot of guys can go north and south, but when he’s going downhill towards the basket, he has the ability to go east and west without losing momentum."</blockquote>
The <a href="http://www.nba.com/rockets/" target="_blank">Houston Rockets</a> shooting guard is hands down one of the most lethal scorers in the NBA. He’s almost impossible to contain if he has a full head of steam and good luck trying to stop him if he wants to get to the basket. As Thomas points out, “shifty" and "creative" are the best ways to describe The Beard when he has the ball in his hands. He has a crazy arsenal of moves and a great feel for the game. We have nothing bad to say about James Harden. He is one of the best in the business. Unfortunately, some players simply have more tricks up their sleeves when it comes to handling the ball.

<h2>3. Stephen Curry</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas on <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/4612/" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a></span>:
<blockquote>“A lot of guys have a skill set that includes the ability to drive, pass and shoot. But not a lot of those guys also have the handles to do everything in between and create any of the three for themselves.

Steph does."</blockquote>
Stephen Curry is intelligent, fluid, and deadly from pretty much anywhere on the floor. Thomas notes the MVP’s ability to create for himself and others for good reason —  because Curry is so capable of getting his own shot off and making everyone around him better, you have to respect every facet of his game. Chef Curry knows this. And his ability to take advantage of this fact is what helped turn the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> into NBA champions. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Curry’s handle. In fact, it’s part of what makes him such a fascinating player. We just think there are two players who produce even more magic with the rock in their possession.

<h2>2. Jamal Crawford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_860749" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jamal-Crawford-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-860749 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jamal-Crawford-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jamal Crawford drives to the basket" width="757" height="513" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas on <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jamal_crawford/" target="_blank">Jamal Crawford</a></span>:
<blockquote>“Jamal is a straight streetballer. He doesn’t have a signature or go-to move. He’s always doing something different depending on the situation, and he’s always trying crazy new stuff. He’s just so gifted that I don’t think he even knows what he’s going to do sometimes. He just does it, and everyone says <i>Wow…</i>He has a combination of instinct and a crazy natural ability to control the ball."</blockquote>
Jamal Crawford is a one-man scoring machine. If you’re looking for a spark, then put J. Crossover into the game, give him the ball, and let him go to work. There’s a good chance he’s going to make something happen. We agree with Thomas that, when talking about the game’s best ball handlers, Crawford does not get enough credit. So this is us giving him his due. And if you’re not with us, take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBEb32OV7Qs" target="_blank">this</a>. We have a feeling it will change your mind. [Editor’s note: Not to mention J-Craw is 35, and has forged a 15 year NBA career out of his insane handles.]

<h2>1. Kyrie Irving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_860778" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kyrie-Irving-David-Maxwell-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-860778 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kyrie-Irving-David-Maxwell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kyrie Irving looks to dribble past Patrick Beverley" width="757" height="577" /></a> David Maxwell/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Thomas on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html" target="_blank">Kyrie Irving</a></span>:
<blockquote>“Kyrie lives laterally. He goes side to side at such a high level it’s hard for defenders to keep up. He’s right in front of you, then he’s not, and it all starts with the crossover. It’s the same move every point guard has in his arsenal.

His is just better."</blockquote>
Not only is Kyrie Irving deceptively quick, but his control over the rock is incomprehensible. It’s like he has the ball on a string. Whether he’s crossing you over or blowing past you to the bucket, Uncle Drew is making his defender look foolish. When it comes to NBA players with an elite handle, in our opinion, No. 2 on the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/cle/cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> is at the head of the class.

		<description><![CDATA[Rumor has it that the Oklahoma City Thunder may be looking to trade Russell Westbrook, and a deal with one of these four teams would make sense.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_663666" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663666" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Russell-Westbrook-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Russell Westbrook bats his chest" width="757" height="505" /> Russell Westbrook bats his chest | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The rumor mill runs hot and heavy this time of year, but the question is: could Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook actually be on his way out of town? At first, after Kevin Durant chose to leave the Thunder <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-kevin-durant-win-73-games.html/" target="_blank">for the Golden State Warriors</a>, the thought process was that the team may have difficulties being able to re-sign their other young star during 2017 free agency, which could result in them wanting to move him sooner than later.

Those rumors blazed  even hotter when <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651708-westbrook-trade-will-happen-sooner-rather-than-later-likely-to-celtics" target="_blank">Bleacher Report's Howard Beck</a> reported that the Thunder want to trade Westbrook "soon." It was in a video, but Beck stated the following:
<blockquote>“What I’m hearing in Las Vegas from some GMs, not only are they hearing that Westbrook will get traded, it’s that it will be sooner rather than later — before the season starts — and the most likely destination is the Boston Celtics.”</blockquote>
Then, of course, Westbrook signed a three-year, $85 million dollar extension. This doesn't keep him in OKC, especially not with the final year being a player option, but it does give the franchise a little more rope.

So, while they're reporting that the Celtics are indeed one of the front-runners to potentially land Westbrook in a trade, who else could be in the mix for the young point guard? Instead of completely speculating, we're going to take a look at a few teams who could put together a pretty nice trade package and have a chance to land Westbrook from the Thunder. We'll start it off with none other than the Celtics, because they have plenty of young talent.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660945" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660945" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jaylen-Brown-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Jaylen Brown after being drafted by the Celtics in the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images " width="757" height="505" /> Jaylen Brown after being drafted by the Celtics in the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

The Celtics simply have so many interesting pieces, that it can be hard to envision even where they'd begin. They obviously can't move Al Horford, who they just signed, but could Isaiah Thomas be on the move? Thomas is a fan favorite, but if they didn't have to give an arm and a leg on top of Thomas, it may be a starting point. Rookie Jaylen Brown's name would likely need to be included, but it really boils down to what the Thunder would want.

The Celtics have guards for days on their roster, and while they'd hate to give up a few of them the prospect of getting one of the best point guards in the league via trade is enticing. Imagine how excited Celtics fans would have to be if Westbrook and Horford were leading the way in the near future?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-617585" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Angelo-Russell-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Denver-hRefUUtNrJxl.jpg" alt="Angelo-Russell-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Denver-hRefUUtNrJxl.jpg" width="757" height="505" />

This is an interesting one, largely due to the fact that ESPN's Chris Broussard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_WT4Nwvtvc&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">recently told MSG</a> that the Lakers truly think they can land Westbrook in 2017 free agency. If this is the case (and, as always, consider the source), then the Lakers obviously won't make much of a move. However, if for some reason they're swayed to believe that a trade would get Westbrook to remain with his new team, then they could start talking about a deal.

You'd have to imagine that any trade between the Lakers and Thunder would have to include D'Angelo Russell, and likely Julius Randle. It'd be interesting to see if Russell, Randle, and a first-round pick would get the job done, because the Lakers likely wouldn't deal No. 2 pick Brandon Ingram at this point. Los Angeles has the young pieces to at least make an intriguing trade offer, but the ball would then be Oklahoma City's court.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570984" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570984" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrew-Wiggins-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images-640x383.jpg" alt="Mike Lawrie/Getty Images" width="757" height="453" /> Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

As excited as Timberwolves fans are about rookie Kris Dunn, they'd be even more excited about Westbrook. That's probably a good thing, because any trade involving Westbrook and the T'Wolves would likely have to include Dunn as well. The Timberwolves have so much young talent that they could offer -- including Ricky Rubio, who is still just 25 --  that they could potentially piece together the strongest offer of the bunch.

Realistically, a package including Kris Dunn andAndrew Wiggins may be enough to entice the Thunder, but there may be a pick thrown in there as well... and that's before you start to wonder if this really makes Minnesota better. Either way, a Westbrook trade still leaves Rubio in a reserve role, which could make him prime trade baito ver this season. It's pretty hard to narrow down a deal between the Timberwolves and Thunder, because there are just so many options.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Atlanta Hawks</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-525146" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Atlanta-Hawks-e1423160281304.jpg" alt="Atlanta-Hawks-e1423160281304.jpg" width="757" height="511" />

One reason why the Hawks are on this list, is because <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16766273/the-warriors-makings-all-super-team-addition-kevin-durant" target="_blank">ESPN's Zach Lowe</a> reported that Paul Millsap was getting a ton of trade interest, including from the Denver Nuggets, and Phoenix Suns, for starters. Millsap would definitely be included in a deal with the Hawks, but the Thunder would likely also want point guard Dennis Schroder as well.

After the Hawks moved Jeff Teague this offseason, the team seems pretty locked in on building with Schroder, but if the potential to land Westbrook came along, it would be tough for them to turn away from that opportunity. If a deal that featured Schroder and Millsap got it done, then the Hawks may be cooking with fire in a pursuit of Westbrook.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA Draft is always loaded with young talent, but these 5 players would have been better off staying in school for another season or two.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_553198" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553198" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2015-NBA-Draft-Elsa-Getty-Images-e1438897077262-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Players Who Should Have Just Stayed in College" width="757" height="505" /> The 2015 NBA Draft class | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Every year, the NBA draft is loaded with young, talented players, often freshmen or sophomores who chose to come out of college early and test the NBA waters. While they have tremendous upside in many instances, it's not surprising to hear that a large number of them don't pan out how NBA teams hoped.

While we all think about <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-kobe-bryants-farewell-game-reminded-us-of-his-greatness.html/" target="_blank">players like Kobe Bryant</a> and LeBron James, who came right out of high school, as well as Carmelo Anthony who left school early, it's not typical to see young players experience success like that anymore. With that said, let's take a look at five players who truly should have stayed in school for another year, or possibly two or three, as it would have massively helped them prepare for life in the NBA.
<h2>1. Trey Lyles, PF, Utah Jazz – 2015 Draft (Pick No. 12)</h2>
Trey Lyles chose to go pro after one season with the Kentucky Wildcats, just like so many other Kentucky players do. As you can tell, Lyles wasn't ready to go, and this was a player who averaged just 8.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game. There was little that made anyone believe he was ready, and the Jazz chose him with the No. 12 pick in the 2015 NBA draft, simply due to upside.

Unfortunately, his first year in the NBA didn't exactly play out how most expected, as he averaged 6.1 points and 3.7 rebounds over 80 games played. Now, Lyles is a player who at least still has the potential to make an impact at the next level -- and it's likely that Utah didn't expect him to take over as a rookie -- but he truly could have benefited from one more season with the Wildcats.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kelly Oubre Jr., SG, Washington Wizards – 2015 Draft (Pick No. 15)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_545296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-545296 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Kelly-Oubre-Jr.-Elsa-Getty-Images-e1435756712345.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Players Who Should Have Just Stayed in College" width="757" height="532" /> Kelly Oubre of the Washington Wizards | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Another player who just flat out made the wrong decision when it came to leaving school early was Kelly Oubre. While he landed with the Wizards after just one season with the Kansas Jayhawks, he also wasn't overly impressive in college. Oubre averaged 9.3 points and five rebounds per game.

His numbers in college obviously weren't terrible, but once again, he wasn't able to do much as a rookie in the NBA. Oubre averaged just 10.7 minutes, 3.7 points, and 2.1 rebounds. Out of anyone in the lottery from the 2015 NBA draft, it's likely that Oubre is the one who really should have stayed another year in school.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Anthony Bennett, PF/SF, Brooklyn Nets – 2013 Draft (No. 1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_545296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-545296 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Anthony-Bennett-UNLV-NBA.jpg" alt="Kelly-Oubre-Jr.-Elsa-Getty-Images-e1435756712345.jpg" width="757" height="532" /> Anthony Bennett of the UNLV Rebels, now a free agent in the NBA. | Jeff Bottari/Getty Images[/caption]

Here's the most painful of the bunch. While the 2013 NBA draft wasn't loaded with superstars, there were plenty of players selected after Bennett who have had far better NBA careers, including Victor Oladipo at No. 2. The former UNLV Runnin' Rebel stayed in school for just one season, averaging 16.1 points and 8.1 rebounds over 27.1 minutes per game.

It's hard to argue with Bennett's decision to enter the draft, as he wound up going No. 1 overall to the Cleveland Cavaliers, but you have to wonder if staying in school a few more years could have helped him become more of an NBA-ready player. Over three years in the NBA, Bennett played with three different teams and is now seeing just over 10 minutes per game with the Brooklyn Nets. His career totals sit at just 4.3 points and 3.0 rebounds per game.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Noah Vonleh, PF, Portland Trail Blazers – 2014 Draft (No. 9)</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Noah-Vonleh-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="DENVER, CO - NOVEMBER 09: Noah Vonleh #21 of the Portland Trail Blazers takes the court against the Denver Nuggets at Pepsi Center on November 9, 2015 in Denver, Colorado.

The decision for Noah Vonleh to leave after his freshman season with the Indiana Hoosiers is slightly understandable. He averaged 11.3 points, nine rebounds, and 1.4 blocks per game, and as you can see, teams bought into the hype. It was the Charlotte Hornets who actually drafted Vonleh, but after seeing him play in just 25 games in 2014, he was traded to the Trail Blazers at the season's end.

While he's seen a little less than five minutes more per game (15.1 in 2015), it hasn't really mattered. Vonleh averaged just 3.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 0.3 blocks per game. It's obvious that he's having trouble with the transition, and truly should have stayed with the Hoosiers for another few seasons.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. James Young, SG, Boston Celtics – 2014 Draft (No. 17)</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/James-Young-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="BOSTON, MA - DECEMBER 11: James Young #13 of the Boston Celtics looks on during the second quarteragainst the Golden State Warriors at TD Garden on December 11, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)" width="757" height="504" />

Kentucky once again with shooting guard James Young. For what it's worth, though, Young was good with the Wildcats, and also played a good chunk of minutes during his lone season there. He averaged 32.4 minutes, 14.3 points, and 4.3 rebounds per game. It's obvious why the Celtics were happy to grab him at No. 17, but that doesn't mean that he shouldn't have stayed in college.

Young's game hasn't transitioned to the NBA very well at all, and after playing in 31 games with averages of 10.7 minutes, 3.4 points, and 1.4 rebounds as a rookie, nothing much has improved -- last season he averaged just one single point and 0.9 rebounds over 6.9 minutes per game.

		<description><![CDATA[The Golden State Warriors' current 2016–17 roster is worse than the 73-9 team from last season. Here are 5 ways they've regressed.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_724832" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-724832" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Stephen-Curry-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why the Warriors Have Regressed This Season" width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Curry shares the ball with some formidable teammates | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Last year, the Golden State Warriors ripped off 24 straight wins to start the season before taking their first loss in Milwaukee on December 12. By then, the 2015<span class="s1">–</span>16 Warriors were already benchmarked against <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-teams-of-all-time.html/">Michael Jordan’s 72-10 Chicago Bulls</a>. Klay Thompson went so far as to suggest that his team would dominate the Showtime Lakers.

These Warriors, for their part, did go 73-9 before finally being tested in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors were actually down 1-3 in the 2016 WCF, after being blown out by a combined 52 points in Oklahoma City. Golden State prevailed in seven games after Thompson suddenly caught fire late in Game 6 and swung the balance of the series.

In the Finals, however, the Cleveland Cavaliers that returned the favor and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-5-greatest-nba-teams-never-to-win-a-championship.html/">turned the tables</a> on the Warriors, clawing their way back from a 1-3 deficit in their own right. After 52 long years without a championship, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/">The Block and The Shot</a> replaced The Drive and The Fumble atop Cleveland sports lore.

In response, the Golden State Warriors blew up much of its rotation, to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors.html/">make way for Kevin Durant</a> and his two-year, $54 million contract. For many, the NBA is a talent-driven league, where Super Teams are the order of the day. So, the idea that Golden State should have passed on Durant would come off as pure blasphemy. In this case, however, the Warrior franchise <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-golden-state-warriors-disappoint-everyone.html/">has actually regressed</a>. The current 2016–17 roster is worse than the 73-9 team from last season. Here are five reasons why.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. The underrated Harrison Barnes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578869" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578869" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Harrison-Barnes-Detroit-Pistons-v-Golden-State-o_OZ0ROo699l.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why These Warriors Are Worse Than the 73-9 Team" width="757" height="483" /> Fans greet Harrison Barnes last season | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

For the Golden State Warriors, Harrison Barnes makes for the best one-to-one comparison in terms of what the team lost and got back through the Durant deal. Last year, Barnes started 59 games for Golden State and put up 12 points to go with five boards and two assists through 30 minutes per game of action. In 2014–15, Barnes was called up to start and relegate Andre Iguodala to the bench and a sixth man role, for the first time in his life. Years ago, many actually compared Barnes to Kobe Bryant before he even set foot on the floor at Carolina.

Dallas signed Barnes <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-worst-free-agent-contracts-2016.html/">to a maximum, four-year $94 million contract</a> this past offseason. He was a restricted free agent, and the Warriors did maintain rights to match any offer from another team and retain his services. Still, Golden State let HB walk, in order to clear out a starting spot and cap space for Durant to sign a max deal in his own right.

Barnes is now only 24 years old, and does have time to expand his game further into his prime years. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dallas-mavericks/">Dallas Mavericks</a> signed Harrison Barnes with the full intent of the swingman emerging as the go-to scorer on the team. Barnes has not disappointed, upping his statistical performance across the board to now drop in 23 points per game. HB is out on the floor for 38 minutes each contest, without the fear of getting the quick hook for Iguodala after one mistake.

Meanwhile, Durant is putting up his all but standard 28 points per game in Golden State off ridiculous 56% shooting, as one of the more polished scorers in the history of the game. Still, the gap in performance separating these two forwards from each other does not justify gutting the rotation. Real contenders will expose the Warriors for their lack of size and depth.

<h2>4. Lack of size</h2>
[caption id="attachment_554918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-554918 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Stephen-Curry-and-LeBron-James-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why These Warriors Are Worse Than the 73-9 Team" width="757" height="502" /> Stephen Curry attempts to block LeBron James | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Beyond Harrison Barnes, the Golden State Warriors also parted ways with their entire center rotation <span class="s1">-- </span>Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, and Marreese Speights <span class="s1">-- </span>to make way for Durant. As a group, these three players averaged 20 points, 16 rebounds, four assists, and three blocks for 2015–16. Last year, the coaching staff did have the flexibility to rotate traditional and small ball lineups. Bogut was the starter, as the anchor of the defense and willing passer on the low block. Next,<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-was-steve-kerr-the-right-choice-for-coach-of-the-year.html/"> Steve Kerr</a> would bring Ezeli off the bench, for his energy and athleticism. Meanwhile, Mo Buckets would remain at-the-ready, for his instant offense and mid-range jumpshot.

To dump salary, the Warriors dealt Bogut to Dallas this offseason, for pennies on the dollar and future draft picks. They let Ezeli and Speights go, so they hit the market as free agents and signed deals with the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Clippers, respectively. From here, the Warriors were left to fill out their roster with the likes of Zaza Pachulia and a ring-chasing David West. Draymond Green, at 7-foot-7, is now the team’s leading rebounder, with 10 boards per game.

As a group, the Warriors have fallen from the fourth- to the 14th-ranked rebounding team in the NBA. Small ball is now a necessity in Oakland, instead of a change-of-pace novelty. Pachulia, the starting center, is only checking into the game for 17 minutes before being yanked for a lineup featuring Stephen Curry, Thompson, Iguodala, and Durant flanking Green at center. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/teams-stop-golden-state-warriors.html/?a=viewall">Cavaliers, Clippers, and Spurs</a> all have the personnel to gash the Golden State Warriors inside, with timely offensive rebounding and post scoring. Size matters the most in the playoffs, when the tempo slows to a halt and outside shots simply stop falling.

<h2>3. Weak bench</h2>
[caption id="attachment_652440" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-652440" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Anderson-Varejao-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x405.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why These Warriors Are Worse Than the 73-9 Team" width="757" height="479" /> Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors reacts on the bench with (R-L) Festus Ezeli, Anderson Varejao, and Ian Clark | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The mass exodus out of Golden State gutted the second unit, with Ezeli, Leandro Barbosa, Brandon Rush, and Speights all seeking bigger paydays and playing time elsewhere. Last year, these four rotation players combined for 25 points, 13 rebounds, and four assists per game, with each of these reserves checking in for roughly 15 minutes of game time. Now, Iguodala and Shaun Livingston remain the two primary bench holdovers from the 73-9 team. Iguodala has averaged more than 25 minutes per game throughout his time in Golden State, performing more so as a sixth starter out on the floor in crunch time.

Beyond Iguodala, Kerr has dramatically shortened his rotation, with only Livingston, Patrick McCaw, and Ian Clark getting significant runs off the bench. David West looks every bit of 36, and is only putting up four points per game through less than 1<span class="s1">0</span> minutes of game time. Last season, the second unit worked itself into the game seamlessly with the starters. This allowed the Golden State coaching staff to experiment with all types of wacky lineups without missing a beat.

Imagine Thompson and Green running a two-man game with the reserves, before whipping the ball around the perimeter to a wide-open Mo Buckets. On the next possession, after forcing the defense to commit, Barbosa would call for the ball at the top of the key to go to work out of isolation. Barbosa once racked up 18 points per game, as a young speedster and provider of instant offense out of Mike D’Antoni’s system in Phoenix.

Now, the Golden State Warriors will rely heavily upon their starters for offensive production, which may make the team more predictable and easier to guard. So far this year, Durant, Curry, Thompson, and Green are putting up 85 points per game, or a staggering 75% of the team’s total offensive production. Without relief, expect the starters to be totally gassed down the stretch of the regular season. From there, a weak bench is a recipe for disaster in the playoffs.

<h2>2. Defense wins championships</h2>
[caption id="attachment_542148" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-542148" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Iggy-LeBron-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x443.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why These Warriors Are Worse Than the 73-9 Team" width="757" height="524" /> Harrison Barnes faces off against LeBron James | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Golden State Warriors, like the Dynasty San Francisco 49ers before them, have managed to pair historically high-octane offenses in front of solidly underrated defensive units. We'll forever associate the Dynasty 49ers with Bill Walsh, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger Craig, Steve Young and the West Coast offense. On the other side of the football, however, were also the likes of Ronnie Lott, Charles Haley, Merton Hanks, Deion Sanders, and Ken Norton, Jr.

In 2014–15, Golden State limited the opposition to less than 100 points per game. That season, the Warriors were also actually second in the league in blocks per game (with 3.6) and held opponents to a league low .428 field goal percentage. These Warriors went 67-15, ripped through the Western Conference Finals, and took the Finals in six games over a bloodied, but unbowed Cleveland lineup. Last year, the much-underrated GSW defense was back at it again, to close out the regular season third in blocks (4.1) and third in opposing field goal percentage (.435).

The Warriors' defense, at its best, featured swarming wing defenders that could switch off multiple positions, Curry playing the passing lanes, and the constant wolfing of Green. Bogut would then stand tall as the last line of defense, as one of the better rim protectors and rebounders in the league. Bogut, for his part, was named Second Team All-Defense to close out 2015. Bogut, of course, is now hauling in 11 rebounds per game, while wearing a Dallas Mavericks uniform.

The GSW defense has regressed dramatically, without Bogut patrolling the paint behind waves of perimeter defenders. Opponents are now shooting 45% from the field and putting up 108 points per game, which rank as a rather pedestrian 15th and 23rd in the league, respectively. The 2016–17 Warriors have been especially bad at forcing turnovers and closing out upon perimeter shooters. With time, these reconfigured Warriors will find that the old cliche still holds true: Defense wins championships.

<h2>1. The evil empire</h2>
[caption id="attachment_608696" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-608696" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Steph-Curry-J-Pat-Carter-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="5 Reasons Why These Warriors Are Worse Than the 73-9 Team" width="757" height="504" /> Oklahoma City Thunder fans try to distract Stephen Curry as he shoots a free throw | J Pat Carter/Getty Images[/caption]

For several years running, the Golden State Warriors and their freewheeling, plucky style endeared themselves to fans. In 2007, the GSW took out the Dallas Mavericks in six games, as an eighth seed. In doing so, Don Nelson introduced the world to the concept of small ball, with the likes of Baron Davis, Stephen Jackson, and Jason Richardson running up and down the floor to harass a statuesque Dirk Nowitzki into missed shots and ugly turnovers.

Two years later, in 2009, the Warriors drafted Curry as the seventh round out of tiny Davidson College. At that point in time, a then relatively frail Curry and his weak ankles appeared as if he would be more so comfortable heading up an IT Department than he would be pulling up from behind the arc and draining another three-point bomb. Curry is now competing against himself, after shattering the single-season three-point makes record for four years running.

The wacky lineups have continued at Oracle Arena, with Kerr now at the helm. When going small, Kerr would install Green at center, and flank him with four sharp shooters, ball handlers, and cutters out on the floor. At times, it would appear as if this Death Lineup was actually better than any NBA 2K video game simulation, with Green driving the lane off the high pick-and-roll before kicking the ball out to a wide open Thompson or Stephen Curry. This was the basketball revolution that endeared itself to legions of fans, coaches, and analysts globally.

The irony of any Revolution, however, is that groundbreaking concepts gradually become associated with The Establishment. By the 2016 Finals, it was the 73-9 Golden State Warriors that suddenly found themselves as the matrix and raging machine against the suddenly lovable underdog James. The Warriors, after losing the Finals in seven games, signed the best pure scorer in basketball away from his trusted running mate Russell Westbrook. Expect the Golden State Warriors to now be booed off the floor, as the Evil Empire, especially when Durant makes his return to Oklahoma City on February 11, 2017.

Thompson and Green are already both off their games and repeatedly throw up bricks out of the flow of the offense. In crunch time, Durant will resort to bad habits, pound the ball out of isolation, and clang a shot off the back of the rim late in the clock. Mercenary, hired gun "championship or bust" expectations will take the joy out of the game for KD and the Warriors.

		<description><![CDATA[Larger salary caps create a free-agent feeding frenzy. So, now that the superstars have signed contracts, we can assess the 5 worst free agent contracts.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[A fairly recent collective bargaining agreement and $24 billion TV deal have worked in tandem to explode the salary cap from $70 million to $94 million for the 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 season. Of this amount, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-free-agency-winners-losers.html/" target="_blank">teams must spend</a> 90% of the cap, or $85 million, at minimum. For 2017–2018, the salary cap will likely take another step up toward $110 million.

Predictably, these ongoing developments have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nba-free-agency-names-landed.html/" target="_blank">triggered a free-agent feeding frenzy</a> with role players set to earn more money in one year than more people may see in their lifetimes.

On July 4, Kevin Durant announced that he would <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors.html/" target="_blank">sign with the Golden State Warriors</a>, setting off another round of fireworks in the sporting world. Apparently, all other NBA teams had to play for second place. Against this backdrop, these are the five worst free agent contracts, with billionaire NBA owners now seemingly happy to throw money on the ground and set it on fire.
<h2><strong>5. Bismack Biyombo</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_632891" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632891" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bismack-Biyombo-Vaughn-Ridley-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Worst Free Agent Contracts for 2016" width="757" height="540" /> Bismack Biyombo, now with the Orlando Magic | Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

Bismack Biyombo earned himself tens of millions of dollars through a two-game playoff stretch when he dominated the paint for 40 rebounds and seven blocks against Cleveland in the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals. He stepped into the starting lineup after Toronto shut down Jonas Valanciunas for the postseason with an ankle injury. In his wake, Biyombo flashed examples of raw athleticism, in closing out upon drives to the paint, recovering, boxing out, and controlling the glass.

Biyombo, however, was a complete unknown to all but the most fervent of basketball diehards prior to the 2016 ECF. In 2011, he went seventh overall to the Sacramento Kings, before being promptly dealt to Charlotte and backing up Al Jefferson for four years. In all, Biyombo has put up a mere five points, seven rebounds, and two blocks per game as a career backup; he earned $3 million in salary for 2015–16. Still, the Orlando Magic went on to sign him to a four-year, $72 million contract.

This move comes off as even more curious, given the fact that the Magic orchestrated a draft day trade to ship Victor Oladipo off to Oklahoma City in exchange for Serge Ibaka (who also hails from the Congo) with big men Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic already on the roster. Biyombo may be described as a poor man’s Ibaka, at best. If anything, there will be a logjam at the four and five in Orlando -- the very same time that pace-and-space small ball is all the rage in the NBA.

<h2><strong>4. Chandler Parsons</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_665889" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-665889" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chandler-Parsons-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Worst Free Agent Contracts for 2016" width="757" height="532" /> Chandler Parsons, formerly of the Dallas Mavericks | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Chandler Parsons is arguably the most overrated player in the NBA. Last year, he emerged as the unlikely lead recruiter for the Dallas Mavericks in the DeAndre Jordan sweepstakes. At the time, Parsons pitched himself as a versatile point forward, who could run the offense, create for teammates, and step out beyond the arc to knock down clutch shots. Jordan, however, was not impressed, and backed out of the deal at the 11th hour.

For his part, Parsons has put up 15 points, five rebounds, and three assists per game through two injury-plagued seasons in Dallas. The 27-year-old has already undergone two separate surgical procedures to repair damage in his right knee. He recently went back under the knife last March, which ended his season and kept him out of the playoffs.

Still, an irrationally confident Parsons demanded maximum money. Mark Cuban and the Mavs <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-nba-players-who-could-opt-to-become-free-agents.html/" target="_blank">called his bluff</a>, and let him walk right into a four-year, $95 million contract in Memphis. The Grizzlies, with Parsons in the fold, will be a pesky first-round playoff out, at best.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>3</strong><strong>. Mike Conley</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_632891" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632891" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mike-Conley-Memphis-Grizzlies.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Worst Free Agent Contracts for 2016" width="757" height="540" /> Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Mike Conley, with his five-year, $153 million contract, is now the highest-paid player in the NBA. This deal, in its totality, is actually the biggest in NBA history, with only Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan ever making more than $30 million in one season. The 28-year-old has never made an All-Star team and is easily overshadowed out West, with the likes of Stephen Curry, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, and Damian Lillard stuffing their respective stat sheets and highlight reels.

Last season, Conley put up 15 points, three rebounds, and six assists per game in Memphis. The 2015–16 Grizzlies, however, were a literal MASH unit, with Conley, Marc Gasol, Tony Allen, and Zach Randolph all missing significant time due to injury. A banged-up Memphis squad did go 42-40 and sneak into the playoffs, before being swept out of the first round by San Antonio. The much-beloved Grit and Grind appears to be abruptly ending in Memphis.

Interestingly, Conley’s new contract may come off as somewhat of a bargain by the end of its five-year term. By then, Curry and Westbrook will likely have signed new, blockbuster deals. In 2013, it was Chris Paul who signed a five-year, $107 million contract that made him the highest-paid point guard in the league at the time. CP3's money now looks like chump change.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5">2. Harrison Barnes</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_578869" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578869" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Harrison-Barnes-Detroit-Pistons-v-Golden-State-o_OZ0ROo699l.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Worst Free Agent Contracts for 2016" width="757" height="483" /> Harrison Barnes, now with the Dallas Mavericks | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Harrison Barnes joins the likes of Jason Caffey, Andrew Bynum, and Mario Chalmers as a role player on a championship team who happens to sign a mega-deal to serve as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-players-stock-improved-free-agency.html/" target="_blank">savior to a desperate franchise</a>. Delusional fans are more than happy to overpay for former assistants and video guys to winning programs. Apparently, through osmosis, any player from a championship team can transform a losing culture into a winning one overnight. Enter the Mavericks.

In recent years, Mark Cuban and the Mavs have been desperate to restore Dallas as a prime destination for free agents after swinging for the fences and missing spectacularly upon the likes of Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Marc Gasol. Cuban, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-craziest-franchise-owners.html/" target="_blank">despite his own fan-boy willingness</a> to open up his checkbook, was left with Wesley Matthews and Deron Williams as consolation prizes. For Dallas, this offseason will be no different, after being spurned by both Hassan Whiteside and Conley.

The Mavs, of course, willingly let Chandler Parsons walk, apparently in anticipation of striking gold in free agency. Dallas, with the smoke clearing, will sign Harrison Barnes to a four-year, $94 million maximum deal. In effect, the Mavs swapped out Parsons’ 15/5/3 for Barnes’ 10/5/2 -- at the same pay grade. With time, the Barnes deal will surely go down in infamy in the Metroplex, right next to the ghosts of Rajon Rondo and Erick Dampier.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>1. Timofey Mozgov</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_542146" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-542146 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Bogut-Green-Mozgov-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: The 5 Worst Free Agent Contracts for 2016" width="757" height="493" /> Bogut Green (R) and Timofey Mozgov duke it out. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Timofey Mozgov has unwittingly emerged as poster-child free agent excess, as he signed a four-year, $64 million deal with the Lakers. For cynics, this deal has it all: a big man abandoning his championship team for empty Hollywood promises. The Lakers are now a franchise in shambles, after hanging 16 championship banners and seeing Kobe Bryant off into the twilight.

From here, Mozgov will likely join the infamous ranks of Jim McIlvaine and Jerome James as overpaid stiffs who return to the end of the bench after being dunked on. Mozgov, in the 2016 NBA Finals, played a total of 25 minutes for seven points, eight rebounds, and eight personal fouls. For this, he will collect $4 million more in 2016–17 salary than league MVP Stephen Curry.

Mozgov, at his best, put up 11 and seven in 2014–15 for the Cavs. In Game 4 of those finals, he did put up a more inspired 26 points and 10 rebounds when allowed to roam free through a 21-point blowout loss. If anything, the results proved that Mozgov, as a seven-foot behemoth, is obsolete in the modern, small-ball era. The Lakers took several steps back -- to the point where the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-landing-spots-russell-westbrook.html/" target="_blank">pipe-dream to sign Westbrook</a> is the only hope for the franchise.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_829293" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829293 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Seth-Curry-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Sibling Rivalry: Who is the Better Brother?" width="757" height="504" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Last offseason, the Sacramento Kings agreed to terms with and then signed Seth Curry, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-youngest-nba-finals-mvps-now-featuring-kawhi-leonard.html/">the younger brother of reigning NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Stephen Curry</a>. The deal was worth $2 million for two years and included a player option for the second year (which he declined), and after impressing folks with a solid string of play in April, he managed to sign <a href="https://twitter.com/WojVerticalNBA/status/750147956196663296">a similar deal with the Dallas Mavericks</a>.

While the Kings didn't officially adding the Currys to the list of brothers who have played in league (Seth already had four career games under his belt), they did bring the brothers the closest they’ve been since they were both a part of the Golden State organization (Seth, however, was unable to get called up from the Warriors D-League affiliate).

On the surface, the gulf between the two Currys is about as large as the one between their two respective teams — Stephen, in addition to being the reigning MVP, is the leader of an NBA Championship team, while Seth is a veteran of 10-day contracts and went from a team whose biggest recent headlines involved a <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/25/8846593/vivek-ranadive-kings-demarcus-cousins-trade-rumors" target="_blank">bitter dispute</a> between head coach George Karl and star player DeMarcus Cousins (and owner Vivek Ranadive) and <a href="http://deadspin.com/predictably-in-just-24-hours-the-kings-plans-have-gon-1715587877" target="_blank">repeated swings and misses</a> in attempts to land high profile players with their cap room (though they eventually <i>did</i> land Rajon Rondo) to a team that's trying to ride out the end of Dirk Nowitzki's career with some dignity.

That being said, the Currys are hardly the first pair of NBA brothers to be a little imbalanced in the skills department. It’s also worth mentioning that having played at Duke and just being an NBA player at all means that Seth Curry is better at the game than about 99.9% of the people on this planet.

Still, no one is going to confuse these guys with the Gasols. To that end, it’s fun take a look at some examples of unequally distributed superstar talent. Including Steph and Seth, here are five of the most prominent.  <!--nextpage-->

During the Warriors’ breakout, runaway 2015 Championship season, casual fans were introduced to their ringleader, sharpshooter Stephen Curry, whose combination of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudiJUlxb10" target="_blank">unreal ball-handling skills</a> and <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/04/15/warriors-stephen-curry-77-straight-three-pointers-practice" target="_blank">silky smooth touch</a> from beyond the arc work together to make him virtually impossible to guard.

Truth be told, though, he’s been a three-time All-Star and All-NBA performer, as well as the nation’s leading scorer in Division 1 basketball during the 2008-2009 season when he was at Davidson. To date, he has career averages of 20.9 points and 6.9 assists per game, as well as 44% and 47.1% marks on three-point field goals and overall field goals, respectively.

Seth, to his credit, was a First Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) performer at college powerhouse Duke and in six games for the New Orleans Pelicans’ Summer League team, led the whole league in scoring with 24.3 points per game. At least for this summer, the newest King has already shown he can occasionally play like royalty.  <!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Blake and Taylor Griffin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_829296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829296 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Taylor-And-Blake-Griffin-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Sibling Rivalry: Who is the Better Brother?" width="757" height="517" /> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Non-sports fans are still likely to recognize the telegenic Blake Griffin as “that guy from the Kia commercials." As charismatic, entertaining, and aerodynamic as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41EFwuBqEUA" target="_blank">2011 Slam Dunk Contest Champion</a> is, he’s also a tremendously complete player and bona fide superstar who has been a five-time All-Star, four-time All-NBA performer, Rookie of the Year, and National College Player of the Year in 2008-2009 while at Oklahoma.

With career averages of 21.5 points and 9.7 rebounds per game, Blake has been a dominant force in the low post for the Clippers since entering the league in 2010, more than justifying his status as the No. 1 overall pick in the draft that year.

His older brother Taylor, after being selected in the second-round by the Phoenix Suns in 2009 and subsequently appearing in eight games for them that year (averaging 1.3 points), is currently toiling away in the D-League. Whether or not he makes it back to the NBA, he’ll always have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhJgRG_nNfE" target="_blank">this moment</a> to hang onto.

<h2>3. Mark and Brent Price</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XekYUO-Z7ag"></iframe>
The only “better brother" on this list to have not won any season-ending, league-wide awards and probably the greatest Cleveland Cavalier other than some guy named LeBron, Mark Price was a sharp-shooting point guard from Georgia Tech whose game would have fit in nicely in today’s up-tempo NBA.

A two-time All-American at Georgia Tech, as well as a three-time First-Team ACC performer, Price was a four-time All-Star and All-NBA performer and, in 1988-1989, became only the second member of the “50-40-90" club, making 50% of his field goals, 40% of his three point field goals, and 90% of his free throws. At the time, Larry Bird was the only other player to have achieved the feat, doing it twice. He even had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjv2EEg2-gc" target="_blank">an answer</a> for “The Answer," Allen Iverson, later in his career.

While Mark Price finished with career averages of 15.6 points and 6.7 assists per game, his younger brother Brent spent parts of 10 years in the NBA, never reaching quite the same heights. An All-Big Eight (now the Big 12) performer at Oklahoma in 1991-1992, Brent Price finished with career NBA averages of 5.9 points and 3.9 assists per game.  <!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. George and Derrick Gervin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_829305" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829305 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/George-Gervin-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Sibling Rivalry: Who is the Better Brother?" width="757" height="493" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Ask any fan who the three greatest San Antonio Spurs of all-time are and you’ll get two obvious answers: Tim Duncan and David Robinson. While those go without saying, you’re likely to get a debate about the third if they recognize the name at all. However, prior to their recent run of dominance, it’s likely that George Gervin, the one once called “The Iceman," might well have been the best Spur ever.

After starring in college at Eastern Michigan, Gervin was a 12-time All-Star between the ABA and NBA (prior to the leagues merging).Gervin also was a nine-time All-League performer between the two and a four-time NBA scoring champion. His excellent career, in which he finished with an average of 25.1 points per game, merited the retirement of his No. 44 by the Spurs and a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame induction in 1996. Here he is showing off that shooting touch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCk7SjkSE4c" target="_blank">playing “H-O-R-S-E"</a> with “Pistol" Pete Maravich.

His brother Derrick, a star at the University of Texas at San Antonio, appeared in 77 games in two seasons for the New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, averaging 8.8 points per game. In spite of his short NBA tenure, Derrick did have his No. 30 retired by UTSA in 2006 and can match his more accomplished older brother in at least one area: keeping the NBA Championship champagne on ice.  <!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. George and Ed Mikan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_829143" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829143" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1953–54_Boston_Celtics_practice-541x500.jpeg" alt="NBA Sibling Rivalry: Who is the Better Brother?" width="757" height="699" /> Hult Studio/The Sporting News Archives[/caption]

Nicknamed “Mr. Basketball" and the pioneer of the famous, ambidextrous hook shot drill known as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho9GJkWyuYQ" target="_blank">The Mikan Drill</a>" (which, incidentally, has been a staple for essentially all power forwards and centers since its invention), the 6-foot-10 George Mikan was a dominant, legendary player from the league’s earliest years, before it was even called the NBA.

Winning a total of seven championships between the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America, which came to be known as the NBA, Mikan also was a six-time All-NBA performer, a four-time All-Star, a three-time scoring champion, and the NBL’s MVP in 1947-1948.

Playing the majority of his career with the Minneapolis Lakers, Mikan had career averages of 23.1 points (22.6 when including his NBL years) and 13.4 rebounds per game. He was likewise enough of a star at DePaul University to have had his No. 99 retired, as well as being a three-time All-American and The Sporting News Player of the Year in 1944-1945. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in its inaugural class of 1959.

Although he helped his brother and DePaul win the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in 1945, Ed Mikan never measured up to his all-time great brother, finishing with modest career numbers of 6.7 points and 5.5 rebounds per game across six professional seasons.

		<description><![CDATA[With Kevin Durant off to Golden State, the Thunder may look to move Russell Westbrook. Here are 3 potential landing spots for the All-Star guard.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_663666" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663666" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Russell-Westbrook-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA: 3 Potential Landing Spots For Russell Westbrook" width="757" height="505" /> Russell Westbrook stands on the floor during the 2016 Western Conference Finals. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The only thing louder than <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kevin-durant/" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a>'s decision to join the Golden State Warriors was the overwhelming <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/" target="_blank">response it generated on Twitter</a>. Everyone <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-joining-warriors-reactions.html/" target="_blank">from NFL players</a> to members of the NBA and fans in general seemed to have an opinion on the matter. Some of these feelings were positive, some of them were negative, and some were just straight up salty.

This one choice affected a lot of people -- however, the way we see it, none were more affected than his <em>now</em> former teammate, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/russell-westbrook/" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a>. After a 2015–16 season in which he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html" target="_blank">23.5 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 10.4 assists per game</a>, earned First-Team All-NBA honors, and came within one victory of playing in the NBA Finals for the second time in his career, Westbrook is officially the lone superstar in Oklahoma City.

For the first time since he entered the league back in 2008, we'll finally see, as will the Thunder organization, what Russ can accomplish on his own. As exciting as this should be, it's also pretty nerve-racking. After all, Westbrook, himself, is an <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/russell-westbrook/" target="_blank">unrestricted free agent after this season</a>. That's right, one season removed from losing Durant, the Thunder will face the possibility of losing a second superstar.

As much as the organization would like to lock him up long-term, Westbrook has <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242687/Russell-Westbrook-Has-No-Interest-In-Extension-With-Thunder" target="_blank">no interest in renegotiating</a> his current contract; instead, he plans to test the waters of free agency. Which begs the question, if Westbrook could potentially leave in 2017, should the Thunder look to trade him now? For the record, we're not saying that Westbrook is guaranteed to leave OKC.

However, as we learned with KD, it could happen. Therefore, instead of potentially losing another top-five player, without receiving any compensation, it may be in the Thunder's best interest to cash in now -- before it's too late. Should that ultimately be the path the organization chooses to take, here are three potential landing spots for the star point guard.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659591" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brandon-Ingram-Los-Angeles-Lakers-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA: 3 Potential Landing Spots For Russell Westbrook" width="757" height="505" /> Brandon Ingram is interviewed after being selected second overall in the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

The Los Angeles Lakers are an obvious trade partner for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Westbrook was born in Long Beach, Calif., he played college ball at UCLA, and there's already a growing belief that he'll look to head home once he becomes a free agent in 2017. If OKC believes this -- that its only a matter of time before Westbrook leaves anyway -- then the organization might as well get something in return for him.

While the Lakers have been <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/" target="_blank">dreadful over the last few seasons</a>, they do have some solid young pieces who might appeal to the Thunder. As hard as it would be for Los Angeles to part with a group consisting of recent No. 2 overall pick Brandon Ingram, point guard D'Angelo Russell, and power forward Julius Randle, it'd be worth acquiring a player of Westbrook's caliber.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Atlanta Hawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwight-Howard-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 3 Potential Landing Spots For Russell Westbrook" width="757" height="457" /> Dwight Howard walks off the floor during a game against the Spurs. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Although the Atlanta Hawks have been to the playoffs every year dating back to the 2007–08 season, they have never advanced past the conference finals. That being said, given the maneuvers made by the franchise this offseason, including trading away Jeff Teague, re-signing Kent Bazemore, and signing center Dwight Howard to a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16684040/dwight-howard-atlanta-hawks-agree-3-year-705-million-deal" target="_blank">three-year, $70.5 million deal</a>, you get the feeling that this team is just a few pieces away from legitimately competing in the Eastern Conference.

The addition of Westbrook would speed up that process exponentially. In exchange for Westbrook's services, the Hawks would probably have to give up a first-round pick (maybe two), young point guard Dennis Schroder, and most likely some other key assets. Again, if it means landing a guy like Westbrook, it's a no-brainer.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Boston-Celtics-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 3 Potential Landing Spots For Russell Westbrook" width="757" height="505" /> Isaiah Thomas (R) celebrates with Marcus Smart (C) and Jae Crowder during the NBA playoffs. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

The Celtics may have missed out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes, but by signing All-Star center Al Horford to a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16712043/al-horford-boston-celtics-agree-terms-four-year-113-million-deal-according-league-sources" target="_blank">four-year, $113 million max contract</a>, Boston showed it's now a legit destination for NBA stars. For a team on the verge of reaching genuine "contender" status, this is a huge accomplishment.

Making a trade for a player like Westbrook would take things to the next level. While the Celtics would be unlikely to part ways with point guard Isaiah Thomas, they still have plenty of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2016.html" target="_blank">quality assets</a> to send Oklahoma City's way. There's young guard Marcus Smart, shooting guard Avery Bradley, and possibly even 2016's No. 3 overall pick Jaylen Brown.

On top of that, Boston could provide the Thunder with future first-round picks. In the end, this could be a win-win for both parties; especially for the Celtics, who didn't land their big fish, but would be more than satisfied with the consolation prize.

		<description><![CDATA[With so many great, young NBA players entering the league every year, we took a look at the top 10 players who are still under the age of 25.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[With another NBA season nearly upon us, the discussion begins anew. Who are the best, young players and how will they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/star-nba-players-came-nowhere.html/">affect the league</a>? Between the new influx of talent from the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winners-losers-2016-nba-draft.html/">2016 NBA Draft</a>, plus the players who put in hard work and improved their game during the offseason, we’re sure to see a ton of strong athletes perform even better this season. So who are these competitors? We have the top 10 NBA players under the age of 25. They all have promising futures ahead.
<h2>1. D’Angelo Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_588422" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588422" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Angelo-Russell-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Atlanta-Npt2zsM47AZl.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="510" /> Los Angeles Laker D'Angelo Russell goes for it against the Atlanta Hawks | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 20

Taken with the second pick of the 2015 NBA Draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, D'Angelo Russell had a nice rookie season. The left-handed shooting point guard is more of a scorer than a distributor, which makes him a modern fit for the point guard position in the mold of Damian Lillard or Stephen Curry, for example. At just 19 years old and playing for a team that just featured Kobe Bryant's final NBA season, Russell started 48 games and averaged 13.2 points on 41% shooting in 28.2 minutes per game last season.

Now 20 years old and without the shadow of Bryant, Russell and his young counterparts will take the reins for one of the most iconic basketball franchises in the world. The Los Angeles Lakers front office signed several veterans, such as Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov. The franchise also brought in former Laker and Golden State Warriors assistant coach, Luke Walton, to be the team’s head coach. With all these great things in his future, Russell is set up for success.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jabari Parker</h2>
[caption id="attachment_614048" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-614048" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jabari-Parker-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="504" /> Jabari Parker of the Milwaukee Bucks pauses during play | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 21

The second overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, just the year before Russell, Jabari Parker signed on with the Milwaukee Bucks. He started in his first 25 games as a pro, averaging 29.5 minutes with a 12.3 point-per-game average on 49% shooting from the floor. An ACL tear ended Parker's rookie year prematurely, but he returned to the court the next season. He got into 76 games, averaging 14.1 points in 31.7 minutes per game in his second NBA season.

But Parker is tremendously talented, and the fact that he spent his first offseason as an NBA player rehabbing an injury took away from the time he could’ve spent working on his game and becoming a better player. Look for more from Parker, now 21 years old, in the upcoming season. If he’s improved his outside shooting, ball-handling, and defense, he could be a rising star in Milwaukee.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Kristaps Porzingis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_582606" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582606" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Kristaps-Porzingis.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="500" /> Kristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks celebrates after drawing the foul against the Charlotte Hornets | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 21

Kristaps Porzingis is an extremely unique player with a ton of talent. A power forward who’s thin but stands tall at 7-foot-3, he reminds us of an even taller Toni Kukoč with his outside shooting and ball-handling skills. You could even argue that Porzingis is more athletic than Kukoč, as he entered the NBA at the age of 20 while still developing his skills and frame. Kukoč, on the other hand, didn’t make it to the league until he was 25 years old.

Fans were not happy with the New York Knicks for taking Porzingis -- considered to be a major project -- with the fourth overall pick in last year’s draft. But to the shock of many, the young man performed remarkably well as he worked to translate his game to the NBA's style of play. Porzingis averaged 14.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks in 28.4 minutes per game in his first year in the NBA last season.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574000" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574000" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Giannis-Antetokounmpo-Milwaukee-Bucks-v-Boston-JcWO2CQ8WKUl.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="505" /> Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks breaks for the basket | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 21

Giannis Antetokounmpo may have one of the most difficult names to spell in the NBA, but he’s quickly becoming a household name. "The Greek Freak," as many fans know him, is an interesting combination of skills. Antetokounmpo is 6-foot-11, but he plays three positions: point guard, shooting guard, and small forward. It’s not what you expect from a guy his size. At 21 years old and in his third NBA last year, he averaged 16.9 points, 7.7 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.4 blocks in 35.3 minutes per game.

Antetokounmpo is on the last year of his rookie contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, but he’ll only be a restricted free agent following the season; meaning that Milwaukee can match any contract another team may offer him. This means that Antetokounmpo will be a very wealthy man should he continue on his athletic path. Not too bad for a guy who fell all the way to No. 15 in the 2013 NBA Draft.

<h2>5. Andrew Wiggins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_525417" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-525417 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Wiggins-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="504" /> Andrew Wiggins considers his future in the NBA | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 21

Andrew Wiggins' career trajectory was heavily altered the day LeBron James announced he was returning to his home in Cleveland. The Cavaliers took Wiggins with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, but he now saw himself -- as a 19-year-old -- on a roster full of NBA players looking to win a championship. The Cavaliers traded him to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for forward Kevin Love.

Since then, it’s been somewhat slow going for 21-year-old Wiggins as he’s developed in Minnesota. He has defensive head coach Tom Thibodeau on the sidelines now, and there’s no doubting Wiggins' talent, so there’s a good chance he takes a massive leap forward this season. So far in his two years as a pro, Wiggins has averaged 18.8 points on 44.9% shooting in 35.7 minutes per game.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Ben Simmons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_693214" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-693214" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ben-Simmons-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="543" /> Philly's Ben Simmons has the hot jersey right now | Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 20

We don’t know a lot about Ben Simmons yet, but what we do know is positive. Taken in this summer’s draft first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers, Simmons has a chance to be a real hero on a team that’s been rebuilding for as long as most fans can remember. As a freshman at LSU last season, the 6-foot-10, 240-pound forward averaged 19.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 4.8 assists on 56% shooting from the field.

All rookies go through an adjustment period, so the expectation that Simmons will be an immediate superstar is a bit lofty. Regardless, the kid has a ton of talent, and he’ll be surrounded by plenty of other great, young NBA players. Joel Embiid, Nerlens Noel, and Jahlil Okafor are all extremely talented big men who are currently on the 76ers roster as well.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Andre Drummond</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590006" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590006" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Andre-Drummond.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="548" /> Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons faces off against the Atlanta Hawks | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 23

Speaking of talented big men, Andre Drummond has already developed into one of the best in the NBA. Now in his fifth year but still only 23 years old, Drummond led the NBA in rebounding last season at 14.8 per game. He’s also upped his scoring average, posting a career-high with 16.2 points in that category as well. What's most important to Drummond? He helped lead his Detroit Pistons to the playoffs last year as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.

Drummond is looking to take yet another step forward this season, after getting locked up through at least the next four seasons with a contract extension this summer. Drummond may be one of the best centers in the game already, but he still has areas to work on, including consistency, better free-throw shooting, and the ability to stay on the court for more than 30 minutes per night.

<h2>8. Kawhi Leonard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663681" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663681" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kawhi-Leonard-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="517" /> Kawhi Leonard brings up the rock | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 25

As if the San Antonio Spurs needed more luck, they grabbed small forward Kawhi Leonard with pick No. 15 in the 2011 NBA Draft. Although he technically did turn 25 just a few months ago, we won’t count it against him. He’s one of the most dynamic, developing young star players in the game, raising his scoring output every season since coming into the league and peaking at 21.2 points per game last season.

Leonard was a key part of the Spurs team that won the NBA championship back in 2014, averaging 14.3 points per game and 32 minutes as a 22-year-old taking on LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Tim Duncan is no longer around and Manu Ginobili will retire after this season, but a core of Leonard, Tony Parker, and LaMarcus Aldridge is still one of the best in the league.

<h2>9. Karl-Anthony Towns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640952" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640952" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Karl-Anthony-Towns-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="550" /> Karl-Anthony Towns reacts after scoring | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 21

Karl-Anthony Towns is a mix of the traditional center with a little bit of new-school vibes, being able to take his man into the post to score or walk it out beyond the three-point line. After the Minnesota Timberwolves took him with the No. 1 overall pick last year, Towns started all 82 games this year, playing 32 minutes per game, shooting 54.1% from the field, knocking down 30 three-pointers, and averaging 18.3 points with 10.5 rebounds.

Towns is a special player, now just 21 years old, on a team that features other great, young NBA players, such as Wiggins and Zach LaVine. With Thibodeau as his coach, the hard-working young man will likely have the very best brought out in him. That means this core could be title contenders -- not necessarily this season, but maybe in two or three years.

<h2>10. Anthony Davis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_652564" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-652564" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Anthony-Davis-Rob-Foldy-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Top 10 NBA Players Under the Age of 25" width="757" height="504" /> Anthony Davis clearly needs some help | Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

Age: 23

Still just 23 years old heading into the 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 season, Anthony Davis seems to have been around forever. This will be his fifth year in the league, and he's already made three All-Star teams, raised his scoring and rebounding output each year, and become one of the best defensive players in the game. Davis will eventually be a Defensive Player of the Year. In fact, he probably should have won the award already, but he may have been overlooked because of his youth.

Known to many fans as "The Brow," Davis averaged 24.3 points and 10.3 rebounds to go along with two blocks per game last year, becoming a more complete threat on the offensive side of the court by expanding his game out to three-point range. After hitting just 1-for-27 on threes going into the year, Davis was 35-for-108 last year -- a somewhat below average 32.4%, but still good enough to draw the defender away from the basket. Davis is one of the truly special, young NBA players and a superstar for the next decade.

		<description><![CDATA[Since the 2016 draft, No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons has one of the highest-selling jerseys in the NBA. Unfortunately, he hasn't quite cracked the top 5.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_693214" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-693214" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ben-Simmons-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images-640x459.jpg" alt="Philly's Ben Simmons has the hot jersey right now | Nick Laham/Getty Images" width="757" height="543" /> Philly's Ben Simmons has the hot jersey right now | Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

As much as folks may not want to admit it, everyone has a favorite <a href="http://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA</a> player. And there’s nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t mean you lack the love for your hometown team. It just means that, when given the opportunity, you’ll most likely throw your support that player’s way. And how will you do this? By sporting their jersey -- obviously.

When it comes to NBA jersey sales, it's usually the game's more established players who tend stand above the rest. However, every so often, a newbie comes along and winds up disrupting the status quo. And right now, that individual is Philadelphia's rookie sensation Ben Simmons.

According merchandise sales reported by Fanatics.com, since being selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, Simmons finds himself with one of the highest-selling jerseys in the National Basketball Association. As <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/retail/20160901_Sixers__Simmons_scoring_with_merchandise_too.html">noted by Philly.com</a>:
<blockquote>"Since draft night, Fanatics.com is reporting that in terms of merchandise sales, Simmons is the 10th-best seller among National Basketball Association players. He's the highest-selling Philadelphia athlete in all sports across the Fanatics platform of hundreds of e-commerce sites, which includes SixersShop.com - the Sixers' official team store."</blockquote>
For an individual who has yet to step on the floor in a regular-season game, this latest development is pretty impressive. Of course, it's one thing to make the top 10, it's a completely different story to earn a spot among the top five. With that in mind, based on player sales -- on Fanatics.com -- from June 23 to August 31, here are the five players with the best-selling jerseys in the NBA.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Derrick Rose</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Au0ID2gqmRA"></iframe>

After a 2015–16 season in which he averaged just <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html">16.4 points and 4.7 assists per game</a>, former MVP Derrick Rose is ready for a fresh start in the Big Apple. Now a member of the New York Knicks, having been traded away by the Chicago Bulls this past offseason, D-Rose decided to pay tribute to his high school days at Simeon by returning to the number of his youth -- No. 25. While we have no idea if a new jersey number will help return the point guard to the player he once was (it probably won't), the New York faithful -- and Rose fans everywhere -- seem to appreciate the top, making it the fifth highest-selling jersey since the 2016 draft.

<h2>4. Kyrie Irving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644843" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644843" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Kyrie-Irving-Cleveland-Cavaliers-640x427.jpg" alt="Kyrie Irving #2 of the Cleveland Cavaliers reacts in the third quarter against the Toronto Raptors in game four of the Eastern Conference Finals during the 2016 NBA Playoffs at the Air Canada Centre on May 23, 2016 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. (Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)" width="757" height="505" /> Kyrie Irving jersey is getting some love | Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

Since being selected first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2011 draft, Kyrie Irving has slowly evolved into one of the top point guards in the National Basketball Association, earning three trips to the All-Star Game while securing a spot on the Third-Team All NBA back in 2014–15 season.  Of course, it wasn't until his outstanding showing  -- <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html">27.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 3.9 APG</a> -- in the 2016 Finals, including this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxEdwPaF1ko">dagger-to-the-heart three-pointer</a>, that his popularity really began to soar. Now, Uncle Drew's No. 2 jersey is among the five highest-sellers in the game today. Not bad, young buck. Not bad at all.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Kevin Durant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671880" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671880" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-545403316-640x432.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant is a Warrior. Scary. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Kevin Durant is a Warrior. Scary | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

By deciding to sign with the Golden State Warriors this past offseason, Kevin Durant didn't just <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/vegas-picking-win-2017-nba-championship.html/">alter the landscape</a> in the National Basketball Association, he also had a dramatic effect on the sale of player jerseys league-wide. KD has always been among the most popular players in the game today, but now in part to his new "villain" moniker, the No. 35 Dubs jersey is simply flying off the shelves, as it climbs to the third highest-selling top since the NBA draft. Just wait until Durant takes the floor with his new Warriors teammates; something tells us this is just the start of things to come.

<h2>2. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_933578" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-933578" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stephen-Curry-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best-Selling Player Jerseys in the NBA" width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Curry celebrates a basket against the Cavs. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Just when you thought Stephen Curry couldn’t possibly follow-up his 2014–15 performance, he comes out in 2015-16, takes his game to completely new heights, and becomes the <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/curry-mvp-20160510/">first unanimous MVP in NBA history</a>. Granted, his individual heroics didn't result in a second straight title for the 73-9 Warriors, but kept him among the most popular -- and talked about -- players in the game today. Since the 2016 draft,  the Baby-Faced Assassin has the second highest-selling jersey in the National Basketball Association. If he comes out firing this season, it's only a matter of time before he regains his spot at the top.

<h2>1. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642061" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642061" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LeBron-James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="LeBron James prepares for the start of the Eastern Conference Finals. | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> You know you want LeBron James' jersey | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

After <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/">dominating the 2016 NBA Finals</a> and leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to the city's first professional championship in 52 years, LeBron James is back where he belongs -- at the top of the sport. Not only did the Cavs take home the hardware, but LBJ, once again, found himself with the highest-selling jersey in the National Basketball Association. Just as it is on the basketball court, stopping James is easier said than done. As we all know, it's good to be the King.

Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

We've seen <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> do some extraordinary things, many of which have come <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-lebron-jamess-finals-appearances.html/" target="_blank">on the game's grandest stage</a>, but we've never seen him do anything like this.

For an athlete who's spent the entirety of his professional career defying what we thought was humanly possible, these 2016 NBA Finals will go down as the moment when the King took back his crown, took back the league, and -- unquestionably -- took his place among the greatest to ever play step on the court.

With James leading the way, the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the defending champion Golden State Warriors <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400878160" target="_blank">93-89</a> on the road in Game 7, becoming the first team ever to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400878160" target="_blank">overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals</a>.

This victory gives the city of Cleveland its first professional championship in 52 years, but as James's teammates will tell you, the magnitude of what No. 23 accomplished goes far beyond the joy that comes with raising a banner or holding a victory parade. Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson, who announced his retirement after the game, may have said it best:
<blockquote>I've never seen a man in my life tell an entire state: "Get on my back, I got you. Get on my back and I'm going to carry you. I don't care if we fail, I'm going to wake up the next morning and I'm going to start working out and prepare for the next year." He was like, "I'm going to come back home because I promised them that I would do something." And he carried us the whole way.</blockquote>
In a career already filled with remarkable achievements, James's 2016 NBA Finals performance will go down as the finest of them all. To prove we're not exaggerating, here's a look at five stats from the series that will surely leave you scratching your head in disbelief.

<h2>1. Two teams, two MVPs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-3.jpg" alt="5 Impressive Stats From Lebron James's 2016 NBA Finals Performance" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James senses victory. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

After winning two championships in four seasons with the Miami Heat, James set the sports world on fire when he announced that he was "<a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank">coming home</a>" to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Not only did he rise to the challenge and lift his hometown to basketball glory, like the NBA's all-time leading scorer, he distinguished himself from an individual standpoint as well.

In defeating the Golden State Warriors and being named Finals MVP, James became just the second player in NBA history to ever <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/744725514149986305" target="_blank">win the award with multiple teams</a>, joining the great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who took home the honors with the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1971-nba-finals-bullets-vs-bucks.html" target="_blank">Milwaukee Bucks in 1970–71</a> and the Los Angeles Lakers in 1985. Of course, while two Finals MVPs is nice, three is better.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. So valuable in the Finals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656939" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656939" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LBJ-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="5 Impressive Stats From Lebron James's 2016 NBA Finals Performance" width="757" height="505" /> That's three titles for King James. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

James may continue to get scrutinized for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank">four finals losses on his resume</a>, but now that's he's secured his third championship, perhaps the haters will lay off him for a bit. After all, James wasn't just taking his teams to new heights, he was reminding us all just how valuable he truly is.

With this victory, James became only the <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/744725121684897792" target="_blank">fifth player in NBA history to win three Finals MVPs</a>. The other names on the list? We have a feeling you'll recognize them: <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/michael-jordan/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a>, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, and Tim Duncan. That's some might fine company right there.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Individual greatness leads to team greatness</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656961" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656961" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Russell-and-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x433.jpg" alt="5 Impressive Stats From Lebron James's 2016 NBA Finals Performance" width="757" height="512" /> Bill Russell and LeBron James embrace. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

It's only fitting that James and the greatest winner in NBA history, Bill Russell, embraced following the Cavs' victory over the Dubs in Game 7. In the perfect encapsulation of the notion that "game recognizes game," we'd like to believe that Russell is welcoming the King to another exclusive group -- one with just three members prior to James's arrival.

Now that the King is a three-time NBA champion, he can also claim to be one of just four players ever to win three titles and <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/744722148166602752" target="_blank">four regular-season MVP awards</a>, joining the likes of His Airness, Russell, and the Big Fella (Abdul-Jabbar). For those who claim 'Bron isn't worthy of a spot on the NBA's Mount Rushmore, you might want to take a hard look at this list. Four names, four spots -- that's what we like to call "simple math."

<h2>4. Game 7 brilliance</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657008" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657008" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/James-and-Curry-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Impressive Stats From Lebron James's 2016 NBA Finals Performance" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James posts up Stephen Curry in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

In <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201606190GSW.html" target="_blank">Game 7</a> of these finals, when Cleveland needed their best player to rise to the occasion, James delivered in epic fashion, finishing with 27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists, two steals, and three blocks. Putting together a triple-double performance is hard enough; doing it on this particular stage, well, that's historic.

Prior to James's superhuman showing, only two other players in NBA history had ever compiled a <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/744724802154430466" target="_blank">triple-double in Game 7 of the NBA finals</a>, Jerry West in 1969 and James Worthy in 1988. For the record, like the King, both of these legends also earned MVP honors.

<h2>5. Numbers don't lie</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656997" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656997" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="5 Impressive Stats From Lebron James's 2016 NBA Finals Performance" width="757" height="505" /> LeBron James holds the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP award. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Even as the best team (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cleveland-paid-team-eastern-conference.html/" target="_blank">money could buy</a>) in the Eastern Conference, these Cleveland Cavaliers were not expected to dethrone the Golden State Warriors. Still, while this group may have lacked the overall talent of its Western Conference foe, it did have one thing the Dubs didn't: James.

If the Cavs were going to pull off the upset, then 'Bron had to be remarkable -- and he was. But words don't actually do James's finals performance justice, so we'll look to the numbers. As the final buzzer sounded -- and with it the end to Cleveland's 52-year title drought -- James's stat line showed the following averages: <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html" target="_blank">29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game</a>.

As far as both clubs are concerned, no one did it better -- not in any of the above categories. That's right, James, for the first time in the history of the postseason, <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/744727757360365568" target="_blank">led both teams in all five statistical categories</a> for an entire playoff series. Like we said before, there are no words.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to a wildly entertaining 2016 free-agency period, the NBA hierarchy looks different. Here are our NBA power rankings for all 30 teams at this point.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_671880" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671880" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-545403316-640x432.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="511" /> Kevin Durant is a Warrior.

It's hard to predict what's going to happen during the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank">NBA</a> offseason. Although the events are the same every year -- there's the draft, free agency, and the Summer League -- how everything is going to play out remains a mystery. That is, until things actually happen.

We finally reached the point in time when it's safe to break down the offseason. The draft is over (some teams <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winners-losers-2016-nba-draft.html/" target="_blank">made out better than others</a>), the Summer League is caput, and the bulk of the big-name free agents have already picked their destination of choice. Now that the dusk has somewhat settled, particularly on a wild and wacky free-agency period, it's safe to say that things will look a whole lot different next season.

You never really know how teams stack up against each until they actually take the floor. However, that's never stopped us from making an educated guess. With that, here's a look at our NBA power rankings (post-free agency 2016).
<h2>30. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659591" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Brandon-Ingram-Los-Angeles-Lakers-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Will Brandon Ingram remain this happy once the season begins? We doubt it. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

The Los Angles Lakers do have some nice, young talent on the roster. The strides made by D'Angelo Russell in this year's Summer League showed that the second-year point guard may finally be ready to break out, while everyone in Hollywood should be excited about No. 2 overall pick Brandon Ingram's future in purple and gold. However, it won't be all sunshine and rainbows in Tinseltown.

Locking Jordan Clarkson down on a four-year, $50 million deal was a smart move by the organization, but we can't for the life of us understand how the franchise can justify paying Timofey Mozgov $64 million. On top of that, Los Angeles decided it would be wise to give Luol Deng, now 31 years old, $72 million over four years. Talk about another head-scratcher.

We're glad first-year head coach Luke Walton is excited about returning to Los Angeles for his "dream job." He's certainly going to have his work cut out for him.

<h2>29. Brooklyn Nets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671884" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671884" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Brook-Lopez-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-640x458.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="542" /> Brook Lopez's reaction says it all. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

It will be an interesting 2016–17 season in Brooklyn. If you're not excited about a club that's built around center Brook Lopez, then you can at least take solace in knowing that point guard, and former phenomenon, Jeremy Lin is coming to town on a three-year deal that will pay him in the <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/brooklyn-nets/jeremy-lin/" target="_blank">ballpark of $12 million a year</a> -- and he's <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/jeremy-lin-cornrows-hair-style-brooklyn-nets-new-look-point-guard-072016" target="_blank">bringing the cornrows</a> with him.

Even in the Eastern Conference, the Nets won't be competing anytime soon. Fortunately, the hiring of Kenny Atkinson as the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15566924/brooklyn-nets-hiring-kenny-atkinson-coach-part-direction-shift-gm-says" target="_blank">team's new head coach</a> was a step in the right direction.

<h2>28. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661288" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ben-Simmons-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Ben Simmons is interviewed at the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

While it's hard to imagine the Philadelphia 76ers making it to the playoffs this year, it looks as if The Process is finally starting to yield some results in the City of Brotherly Love.

No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/things-learned-nba-summer-league.html/" target="_blank">showed flashes of brilliance</a> in the Summer League and has the makings of a future superstar; center Joel Embiid, after sitting out the past two seasons with foot issues, appears ready to make his NBA debut; and international stud Dario Saric is poised to strut his stuff at the game's highest level.

Throw in the responsible offseason signings of veterans Jerryd Bayless and Gerald Henderson, and something tells us the Sixers should improve on the abysmal <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/2016.html" target="_blank">10-72 mark</a> from this past season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>27. Sacramento Kings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_543598" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-543598 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DeMarcus-Cousins-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-e1435063056511.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="530" /> Things are not going well for DeMarcus Cousins. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

We have no idea what the Sacramento Kings are doing. Based on the tweet he <a href="http://nesn.com/2016/06/demarcus-cousins-probably-hates-kings-nba-draft-judging-by-this-tweet/" target="_blank">sent out on draft night</a>, neither does All-Star DeMarcus Cousins.

With all the bigs on the roster, you'd think the Kings were attempting to do their best Sixers impression. Hey, if nothing else, at least the offseason additions of Arron Afflalo and Matt Barnes will make things in Sacramento interesting. Right?

<h2>26. Phoenix Suns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_602747" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-602747" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Suns-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="504" /> What are we to make of the Phoenix Suns? | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The bad news for Phoenix fans is that their Suns are probably going to be average at best in 2016–17. The good news, however, is that this team, with a roster full of young talent, is looking at a bright future.

While Brandon Knight, Eric Bledsoe, and budding superstar Devin Booker give the Suns a stacked backcourt, the organization should be most excited about somehow managing to draft both Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss in 2016; two raw front-court prospects, each with incredible upside.

Throw in the signing of Jared Dudley, along with bringing the savvy Leandro Barbosa back into the fold, and this was a surprisingly successful offseason in Phoenix.

<h2>25. New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659593" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659593" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Buddy-Hield-New-Orleans-Pelicans-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> What can Buddy Hield do for the Pelicans? | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

The New Orleans Pelicans are a tough team to figure out. If Anthony Davis returns to form after an injury-plagued season and recent No. 6 overall draft Buddy Hield can step in and play right away, then head coach Alvin Gentry should feel good about the group he has at his disposal. If these things don't happen, well, it will be another long season in NOLA.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>24. Denver Nuggets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661297" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661297" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jamal-Murray-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Jamal Murray is interviewed at the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

The Denver Nuggets didn't splurge during the free-agency period, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This club already boasts a young core made up of Gary Harris, Emmanuel Mudiay, Danilo Gallinari, Kenneth Faried, Jusuf Nurkic, and Nikola Jokic, and now with former Kentucky standout Jamal Murray (whom the team took with the No. 7 overall pick), the Nuggets were able to add another valuable piece to the puzzle. Denver isn't ready to compete just yet, but in a few seasons, watch out.

<h2>23. Orlando Magic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639697" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639697" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Frank-Vogel-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> New Magic coach Frank Vogel is ready to change the culture in Orlando. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

We love the Magic's decision to hire head coach Frank Vogel. For the rest of Orlando's offseason maneuvering, not so much.

The Magic were wise to re-sign Evan Fournier and deserve some credit for landing Bismack Biyombo, however, we think they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-terrible-decisions-made-nba-draft.html/" target="_blank">gave up too much</a> to acquire Serge Ibaka from Oklahoma City. This group could've benefited from the addition of rookie Domantas Sabonis, and will no doubt miss the athleticism of Victor Oladipo. We hope the Magic know what they're doing.

<h2>22. Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656620" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656620" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Matthew-Dellavedova-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="564" /> Time to welcome Matthew Dellavedova to Milwaukee. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

We were shocked when the Milwaukee Bucks selected Thon Maker <a href="http://www.nba.com/draft/2016/prospects/thon_maker/?ls=iref:nba:draft:miniboard" target="_blank">with the No. 10 overall pick</a>, but we liked the team's decision to re-sign Miles Plumlee while also adding former Cavs guard Matthew Dellavedova (<a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/milwaukee-bucks/matthew-dellavedova/" target="_blank">four years, $38.4 million</a>) and Mirza Teletovic. The Bucks already boast a solid, young core of players, including Jabari Parker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Khris Middleton. These moves should only make Milwaukee competitive in 2016–17.

<h2>21. Washington Wizards</h2>
[caption id="attachment_608397" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-608397" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/John-Wall-Miami-Heat-v-Washington-Wizards-flG66xvt7sRl-640x400.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="473" /> John Wall gets to the bucket. | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

This was not the offseason the Washington Wizards were hoping for. Not even close.

While the club was able to re-sign Bradley Beal to a max deal, it lost out on the Kevin Durant sweepstakes, fell short in its bid to land Al Horford, and couldn't keep Jared Dudley from leaving for Phoenix. Get ready for another fun-filled season of the "John Wall show" in Washington.

<h2>20. New York Knicks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671889" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671889" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Joakim-Noah-BRYAN-R.-SMITH-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="504" /> Joakim Noah joins the New York Knicks. | Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Welcome Knicks fans to the home of the 2015 Chicago Bulls.

In trading for Derrick Rose and signing Joakim Noah, the New York Knicks have set themselves up to sell loads of merchandise, drive up ticket prices (if that's even possible), and generate plenty of buzz in the Big Apple. Oh, and of course, lose a fair amount of game in the 2016–17. Stay classy, Jimmy.

<h2>19. Miami Heat</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628056 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/HassanWhitesideDetroitPistonsvMiamiHeatd8Hs4GVANQKl.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="500" /> The Miami Heat are Hassan Whiteside's team now. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Keeping center Hassan Whiteside in South Beach was an absolute must for the Miami Heat this offseason. Mission accomplished, as the 27-year-old signed a new four-year, $98 million deal. They also made a wise decision to bring back Tyler Johnson on a four-year, $50 million contract. But let's be honest, the real story in Miami revolves around the player they were <em>not</em> able to bring back. We can't wait to see how this one plays out.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>18. Dallas Mavericks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_629301" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-629301 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DirkNowitzkiSanAntonioSpursvDallasMavericksh5tcKDJR-ckl.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="500" /> Dallas is still all about Dirk Nowitzki. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Once again, the Mavericks weren't able to lure any top-tier centers to Dallas. Still, this offseason wasn't exactly a wash.

The Mavs signed small forward Harrison Barnes, acquired Andrew Bogut from the Dubs, and kept Dirk Nowitzki from leaving town. Will these moves make Dallas competitive in the Western Conference? Probably not -- but it could've been a whole lot worse.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>17. Chicago Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671897" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671897" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dwyane-Wade-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="521" /> Dwyane Wade is all smiles. For now. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Just when you think the Chicago Bulls -- after trading away Derrick Rose -- are about enter rebuild mode, they flip the script and do something even more "remarkable": They get older.

Don't get us wrong, we can't wait to watch as Jimmy Butler, Rajon Rondo, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dwyane-wade/" target="_blank">Dwyane Wade</a> try to co-exist in the Windy City. But do we actually think this team is going anywhere anytime soon? Of course not. That would be as crazy as the Bulls' latest offseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>16. Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Karl-Anthony-Towns-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="550" /> Karl-Anthony Towns is poised to take over the NBA. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

We think Tom Thibodeau will do incredible things with a Minnesota Timberwolves team made up of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, and Zach LaVine. Throw in the addition of No. 5 overall pick Kris Dunn, and this club is certainly on the up and up. We expect big things for these Wolves in the near future. (We can't believe we just wrote that.)

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>15. Detroit Pistons</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Andre-Drummond-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="536" /> Andre Drummond is getting funky. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Everyone knew Detroit was going to lock up All-Star center Andre Drummond -- obviously the wise decision -- but the team didn't stop there. This was actually a pretty solid offseason for the Pistons.

They signed Jon Leuer to a four-year, $42 million contract, brought in Boban Marjanovic for $21 million over three years, and showed Ish Smith some love with a three-year contract worth $18 million. The Pistons went 44-38 and earned the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/2016.html" target="_blank">in 2015–16</a>. Don't be surprised to see them improve on those numbers this season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>14. Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Russell-Westbrook_Oklahoma-City-Thunder.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="506" /> All eyes in OKC are now on Russell Westbrook. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The Oklahoma City Thunder had probably the worst offseason in the entire National Basketball Association. That's what tends to happen when you lose one of the three best players in the league to the team that most recently knocked you out of the playoffs. Fortunately, the Thunder still have a top-five player in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/russell-westbrook/" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a>. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-landing-spots-russell-westbrook.html/" target="_blank">For now</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>13. Houston Rockets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_603971" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-603971" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/James-Harden-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-640x388.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="459" /> It's all about James Harden in Houston. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Houston Rockets' offseason is the perfect example of addition by subtraction. They can thank <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dwight-howard/" target="_blank">Dwight Howard</a>'s departure for that. As for pickups, well, the Rockets got some solid ones in Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson. Houston may not make strides in the competitive Western Conference, but coach Mike D'Antoni should at least make them a fun team to watch.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>12. Charlotte Hornets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659718" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659718" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Nicolas-Batum-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="493" /> Nicolas Batum likes what he sees. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Losing both Jeremy Lin and Al Jefferson will hurt the Hornets. Yet, when it comes to the moves Charlotte <em>had</em> to make this offseason, the club totally succeeded, signing both Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams to new deals. We like what we're seeing from the Hornets. Shocking, we know.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>11. Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_599890" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-599890" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Damian-Lillard-Portland-Trail-Blazers-v-Denver-9rsB15QwNwxl-640x400.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="473" /> Damian Lillard is as focused as ever. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Thanks to the backcourt duo of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum, the Portland Trail Blazers were able to withstand the departure of LaMarcus Aldridge last season. With these two in the fold, the Blazers should remain competitive out West. But that doesn't mean the organization didn't make some questionable decisions this offseason.

We'll leave you with this little piece of undeniable insanity: Evan Turner, four years, $75 million. Face. Meet. Palm.

<h2>10. Indiana Pacers</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paul-George-and-Myles-Turner-Tom-Szczerbowski-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="521" /> Paul George chats with Myles Turner. | Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]

We'll never quite understand Larry Bird's decision to fire head coach Frank Vogel, but we have a feeling he will get his wish: The Pacers will score more points this upcoming season.

Paul George is already a stud, Myles Turner has star potential, and point guard Jeff Teague, whom the team acquired in a three-trade with Atlanta and Utah, should only make this existing duo better. Add in recently-signed free agency Al Jefferson, and things are definitely looking up in Indiana.

<h2>9. Atlanta Hawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwight-Howard-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="457" /> Dwight Howard is coming home to Atlanta. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Atlanta Hawks spent the offseason retaining Kent Bazeman and signing former Houston Rockets center Dwight Howard to a three-year, $70.5 million contract. When it comes to the latter individual, this homecoming has the potential to be <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/17033534/dwight-howard-atlanta-hawks-looking-forward-new-beginning-hometown-team?ex_cid=espnapi_public" target="_blank">either a career-reviving move</a> or a catastrophic nightmare. How will this turn out? You guess is as good as ours. All we know is this: He's your problem now, Atlanta.

<h2>8. Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
[caption id="attachment_609161" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-609161" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-Mike-Conley-Marc-Gasol-Memphis-Grizzlies-640x377.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="446" /> The Memphis Grizzlies are staying together. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

With a five-year, $153 million deal, the Memphis Grizzlies officially signed point guard Mike Conley to the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-biggest-contracts-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank">fattest contract in NBA history</a>. On top of that, the club also handed small forward Chandler Parsons a four-year, $98.4 million max contract. So, just in case you were wondering where the bulk of the Grizzlies' cap space is going in 2016, look no further. We just hope they don't come to regret this.

<h2>7. Utah Jazz</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671900" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671900" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Utah-Jazz-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="539" /> The Utah Jazz are ready to make a splash. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

The Utah Jazz are one of the teams that everyone expects to break out this season. Given the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/roster/_/name/utah" target="_blank">depth of talent on the roster</a>, we think it's entirely possible.

The Jazz have Gordon Hayward, Rodney Hood, Rudy Gobert, Trey Lyles, and a hopefully healthy returning point guard in Dante Exum. They also made solid moves in the offseason, acquiring George Hill and Boris Diaw in trades and signing free agent Joe Johnson. It's time for the Jazz to take the next step. Let's see if they can make it happen.

<h2>6. Toronto Raptors</h2>

Losing Bismack Biyombo in free agency will hurt the Toronto Raptors, but not as much as losing shooting guard DeMar Rozan would have. Keeping the latter under contract ensures that Toronto, a team that made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals this past season, remains competitive. We're just not sure they have enough firepower to go any further than that.

<h2>5. Boston Celtics</h2>

The Boston Celtics didn't land their No. 1 offseason target, but they did come away with a star in Al Horford, who signed with the C's for $113 million over four years. Not only was this a big-time signing by Danny Ainge, it also represents a change in the way NBA stars are starting to look at this organization. The Boston Celtics are a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4723450/finally-boston-is-a-free-agent-destination" target="_blank">legit destination for talent</a>. Spread the word.

<h2>4. Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_597609" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-597609" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Clippers-Harry-How-Getty-Images-640x473.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="560" /> The Los Angeles Clippers cannot be overlooked. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

The way we see it, the Los Angeles Clippers didn't do anything to hurt themselves this offseason. When you have a team consisting of Chris Paul, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/blake-griffin/" target="_blank">Blake Griffin</a>, and DeAndre Jordan, you always stand a chance. Plus, the Clips re-signed Jamal Crawford to a three-year, $42 million deal, which is a good thing if you're a fan of instant offense. For the record, we are.

<h2>3. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660723" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660723" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pau-Gasol-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Chicago's Pau Gasol watches the action. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The San Antonio Spurs are never going to be able to replace Tim Duncan; the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-tim-duncans-retirement.html/" target="_blank">reactions on Twitter to his retirement announcement</a> are further proof of that. Still, if the Spurs were forced to say goodbye to arguably the greatest power forward in the history of the game, at least they were smart enough to fill the void with a player as talented as Pau Gasol. Just another example of the Spurs being the Spurs.

<h2>2. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656649" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656649" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-640x428.jpg" alt="NBA Power Rankings: Post-Free Agency 2016" width="757" height="506" /> LeBron James is ready to defend the crown. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Without really trying, the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers have had themselves a fairly solid offseason. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> already informed the team that he was re-signing; sharpshooter Mike Dunleavy recently joined the fold (courtesy of the Bulls needing to make room for D-Wade); and Chris "Birdman" Andersen is ready to bring more excitement to "The Land." That being said, due to recent events, the Cavs will have to settle for being No. 2 on our NBA power rankings.

<h2>1. Golden State Warriors</h2>

Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kevin-durant/" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a> is a member of the Golden State Warriors. This is not a drill, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/" target="_blank">you are not dreaming</a>. This is the reality of the NBA heading into the 2016–17 season. When you add one of the best players in the game to a team that won 73 games the year before, it really doesn't matter that they fell short in the NBA Finals.

Who's got it better than the Dubs? Nobody!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_594015" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594015" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Larry-Bird-JOHN-MOTTERN-AFP-Getty-Images-640x451.jpg" alt="JOHN MOTTERN/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="533" /> Larry Bird waves to the crowd | JOHN MOTTERN/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

At any point in the game, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/">NBA</a> small forward is the most versatile athlete out on the floor. The best small forwards dominate the end-to-end action. On the offensive end, skilled 3-men are capable of filling it up on the wing with smooth midrange jump shots, running the floor in transition, and powering their way to the goal for easy layups and dunks time and time again. Defensively, the best small forwards will get low to their feet and shut down the opposition’s top scorer with timely steals, blocked shots, and tough rebounding.

As part of the team, a great small forward is the coach’s ultimate weapon. When going big, a skilled small forward can handle the ball in space and run the offense as a point forward. When going small, the best 3-men can slide over to power forward to bang bodies in the paint, post up, and crash the boards.

Beyond nuts-and-bolts execution, the ideal small forward is an electric athlete who fires up the home crowd with up-and-under moves, crossover dribbles off the triple threat, and windmill slams on the fast break. With that in mind, here's a look at who we believe represent the 10 greatest small forwards of all time.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. James Worthy</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XezD31XvS7E"></iframe>

In Los Angeles, Big Game James teamed up with Magic Johnson to bring home <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/worthy_bio.html" target="_blank">three championships</a> between 1982 and 1994. For Magic and the Showtime Lakers, Worthy ran the floor to come off the wing for his trademark Statue of Liberty dunks. In the post, the former North Carolina product would toast opponents with his quick spin moves, baseline jumpers, and finger rolls. Over the course of 12 seasons, Worthy’s dynamic talents translated into <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/worthja01.html" target="_blank">17.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, and three assists per game</a> to go alongside his seven All-Star Game appearances.

During the 1988 NBA Finals, Big Game James solidified his status as a clutch performer with a 22-point, seven-rebound, and four-assist per game stat line against the Detroit Pistons. Worthy was at his best in Game 7, when he dropped a 36-point, 16-rebound, and 10-assist triple-double to walk off the floor as NBA Finals MVP.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Adrian Dantley</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wakNTHyztuk"></iframe>

Adrian Dantley <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dantlad01.html">averaged 24.3 points and 5.7 rebounds per game</a> between Buffalo, Indiana, Los Angeles, Utah, Detroit, Dallas, and Milwaukee, all while wearing high socks over the course of a 15-year career. In Utah, Dantley dropped 30 points per game for four straight seasons and led the league in scoring during 1981 and 1984.

As an offensive force, A.D. was a master of the midrange game, where he would knock down 15-foot jumpers time and time again in space. When crowded, Dantley would put the ball on the floor with an explosive first step for easy lay-ins at the goal. Simply put, Dantley was a pure scoring machine.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. John Havlicek</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ARGtKNGp9Y"></iframe>

John Havlicek is the epitome of Boston Celtics lore. With a total game that was greater than the sum of its parts, Hondo relied upon sheer hustle and determination to rack up <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/havlijo01.html">26,395 points over 16 years</a> and finish up his career as <a href="http://www.celticstats.com/leaders/points.php" target="_blank">Boston’s all-time leading scorer</a>. As a defensive force, Havlicek used his lateral quickness to harass opponents into mistakes within half-court sets and create turnovers through steals, deflections, and blocked shots. In transition, Hondo was a supremely conditioned athlete who thrived in a fast break system for uncontested layups and dunks.

Hondo put it all together in 1971, when he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/havlijo01.html" target="_blank">29 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists</a> at forward. As a winner, Havlicek bridged the gap between the likes of Bill Russell, Sam Jones, Dave Cowens, and Charlie Scott to bring home <a href="http://www.johnhavlicekbasketball.com/boston-celtics-nba/8-championships/" target="_blank">eight championships</a> to the city of Boston between 1963 and 1976.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Dominique Wilkins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_631421" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-631421" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dominique-Wilkins-Elsa-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="during the Degree Shooting Stars Competition as part of the 2015 NBA Allstar Weekend at Barclays Center on February 14, 2015 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

The Human Highlight Film was one of the most electric performers to ever throw on a pair of gym shorts. As a raw athlete, Dominique Wilkins was at his best in transition, where he would fire up the Atlanta crowd with his signature windmill slams and tomahawk throw downs. In the 1985 and 1988 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6vRWbVlTDo" target="_blank">slam dunk contests</a>, Nique split two toe-to-toe heavyweight bouts with Michael Jordan off foul-line dunks, 360 spins, and off-the-backboard jams.

Aside from the highlight reel dunks, Wilkins was a pure scorer. When filling it up, he brought the full arsenal of jump shots, drop-step post moves, and hook shots to abuse the opposition. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZEaNL4nLZ0" target="_blank">1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals</a>, Wilkins unleashed his full repertoire against Larry Bird as the two traded baskets in a classic Game 7 duel. When the smoke cleared, the Human Highlight Film had dropped 47 points to Bird’s 34. Unlike Bird, however, Wilkins could not call upon Kevin McHale and Robert Parish for backup as teammates and lost the game, 116-118.

<h2>6. Rick Barry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_604716" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-604716" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Rick-Barry-Steve-Jennings-Getty-Images-634x500.jpg" alt="Rick Barry chats with the crowd |Steve Jennings/Getty Images" width="757" height="597" /> Rick Barry chats with the crowd |Steve Jennings/Getty Images[/caption]

Rick Barry was an overachiever who performed as the Rocky Balboa of professional basketball. Between his time spent in the ABA and the NBA, Barry finished his professional career with averages of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barryri01.html" target="_blank">24.8 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game</a>, actually leading the league in scoring  -- at 36 points per game -- during his sophomore season.

Behind his deadly jump shot, deceptively fast dribble drive, and automatic underhanded free throw shooting, Barry could take over games and score in bunches at any moment. With age, Barry reinvented himself as a playmaker who could draw the defense and find teammates for easy buckets off the wing. Always a scrapper, he is one of the all-time great rebounders from the small forward position. As a rookie, the young Barry hustled to collect 10-plus rebounds per game before averaging more than nine boards a contest over his next two seasons.

Barry, of course, will forever be recognized as the golden boy of the Warriors franchise. <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/barry_bio.html" target="_blank">In 1975</a>, Barry put up 30-point, six-rebound, and six-assist per game averages for the Golden State Warriors while leading them to the promised land of an NBA championship. That year, Barry claimed Finals MVP hardware after a 4-0 Finals sweep of the Washington Bullets.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Scottie Pippen</h2>
&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_695959" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695959" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/285537-e1410281253800.jpg" width="757" height="504" /> Scottie Pippen #33 chats with Gary Payton | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Scottie Pippen (above, right) emerged as the most versatile small forward of all time while playing Robin to His Airness' Batman. Thanks to his fantastic all-around game, Pippen could alternate with Jordan to control the game offensively as a scorer and distributor, clean the glass for rebounds, and also wreak havoc on the defensive end. Always in Jordan’s shadow, Pippen transitioned from his role as a battered but talented little brother against the Bad Boy Pistons into the trusted confidante who held down the fort to carry a flu-ridden MJ off the Salt Lake City Finals floor.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tObgS6uUVjQ" target="_blank">Classic Pippen</a> would lay in wait as a center fielder in the Bulls’ famed 1-2-1-1 full-court press before baiting the opposition into a careless pass for the steal. From there, he would lead the break as a point forward with Jordan racing down the wing. At foul line extended, the two greats would complete a give-and-go that resulted in Pippen elevating for the tomahawk jam. By halftime, Jordan, Pippen, and the Bulls often ran the opposition off the floor and won over millions of fans en route to winning <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/pippen_bio.html" target="_blank">six NBA championships</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Julius Erving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_559648" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-559648 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Julius-Erving-ROBERTO-SCHMIDT-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="501" /> Julius Erving waves to the crowd | ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Before Michael Jordan, it was Julius Erving who captured the collective imagination of the sporting world. Poetry in motion, we can all picture the Great Doctor and his well-coiffed 'fro taking flight from the foul line, wrapping around the basket support to finger roll, or skying from the wing to swoop in for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/throwback-throwdowns-dr-j-rocks-the-baby.html/">cradle dunk in transition.</a>

Beyond the aerial show, Dr. J was also a fundamentally sound offensive threat. Erving led the ABA in scoring during three separate seasons as a player for the Virginia Squires and New York Nets. After winning two ABA titles and making the transition to the NBA game, Erving continued to dazzle crowds in Philadelphia, where he put up <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/ervinju01.html" target="_blank">22 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game</a> over 11 seasons. In 1983, Dr. J joined forces with Moses Malone, Andrew Toney, and Maurice Cheeks to form one of the greatest NBA teams of all time, claiming championship hardware for the Philadelphia 76ers.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Elgin Baylor</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695975" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695975" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/169089608-e1410282328625.jpg" width="757" height="601" /> Elgin Baylor speaks | Kevin Winter/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>3. Elgin Baylor</h2>
Elgin Baylor (above, center), at one point in time, was the savior for the Los Angeles Lakers franchise. One of the game’s most prolific scorers, Baylor simply could not be stopped as he put fans in the seats to watch him fill it up off the wing. Standing 6-foot-5, Baylor was a shorter yet powerfully built small forward who could both beat defenders off the dribble and create enough space with a forearm shiver to rain down jump shots from deep.

After hanging it up, Baylor finished up his 14-year career with averages of  <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bayloel01.html" target="_blank">27.4 points and 13.5 rebounds per game</a>. In his most impressive season, Baylor averaged 38 points and 19 rebounds per game as an <a href="https://www.pioneermilitaryloans.com/blog/2014/elgin-baylors-story" target="_blank">Army Reservist</a> based out of Washington state who could not even practice with his own team. Despite the video game statistics, all-world accolades, and Jerry West backup in Los Angeles, Baylor <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/">lost in the Finals eight times</a> and retired without ever winning an NBA championship.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Larry Bird</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526918 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry-Bird-Tim-DeFrisco-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Larry Bird was an absolute legend | Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Larry Bird was an absolute legend | Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite lacking in athleticism, the Hick from French Lick more than made up for his plodding feet and limited vertical leap through dedication, smarts, and the will to win. As a shooter, Larry Bird could light it up from all spots on the floor. On any possession, Bird could reach deep into his bag of tricks to riddle defenses with his turnaround jumpers, up-and-under moves, and dribble drives to the bucket.

As a passer, Bird would play the angles to feed the likes Kevin McHale and Robert Parish for pretty dunks and scoop shots beneath the basket. In all, Larry Legend compiled 24-point, 10-rebound, and 6-assist per game averages in <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html">13 NBA seasons</a>, all with the Boston Celtics.

Bird, of course, starred as the perfect contrast to Magic Johnson and his Showtime appeal amid the heated Lakers-Celtics rivalry. Bird and Magic met three times in the Finals during the 1980s, with Bird claiming one title and MVP award through these matchups. He would go on to claim <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/bird_bio.html">three total NBA championships</a> as well as two Finals MVP awards.

<h2>1. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642061" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642061" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LeBron-James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="You know LeBron James is the best small forward ever | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> You know LeBron James is the best small forward ever | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Built to play basketball, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/">LeBron James</a> represents an unreal combination of Karl Malone’s body, Charles Barkley’s power, Magic Johnson’s court awareness, and Michael Jordan’s agility out on the floor. Hailing from Akron, Ohio, the St. Vincent St. Mary’s product appeared poised to perform as the savior of the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise immediately out of high school. In Cleveland, James controlled every facet of the game as a clutch scorer, pinpoint passer, and ferocious rebounder. On the break, LeBron often bullied his way into the lane for layups, dunks, and easy put-backs. Over time, he also developed as a defensive force capable of guarding all positions.

After seven years of failed championship dreams, however, James was to deliver yet another devastating blow to the tortured city of Cleveland. With "The Decision," James took his game to South Beach to unite with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. From there, LeBron lead the Heat to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances, winning two, in 2012 and 2013.

In just his second season following his decision to return to the Cavaliers, James put together <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/">one of the greatest Finals performances</a> in NBA history, ultimately bringing the city of Cleveland its first professional title in 52 years and solidifying his place as the greatest small forward of all time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tim-Duncan-San-Antonio-Spurs.jpg" alt="Danny Green #14 of the San Antonio Spurs jokes with Tim Duncan #21 during the fourth quarter of Game One of the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the Memphis Grizzlies during the 2016 NBA Playoffs at AT&amp;T Center on April 17, 2016 in San Antonio, Texas." width="757" height="503" /> Tim Duncan is leaving San Antonio in good hands | Ronald Cortes/Getty Images[/caption]

For the San Antonio Spurs, the 2016 NBA offseason will go down as one that no one will ever forget. The reason for that isn't because they signed a huge free agent, or made a massive trade, but instead, it's because one of the greatest players in history, and definitely the greatest player to ever wear a Spurs jersey, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-tim-duncans-nba-career.html/" target="_blank">decided to call it a career</a>. Tim Duncan is hanging up his huge shoes, and riding off into the sunset.

While Duncan will obviously be missed by the Spurs faithful, there's no question that at the age of 40, he's nowhere near the player he was even just a few years ago. For the first time in his amazing career, Duncan fell below double-digits in points-per-game, while averaging just 7.3 rebounds-per-game as well. All-in-all, this was a career that we will never forget, but it also means that it's time for him to pass the torch.

For the Spurs, the attention will now shift to Kawhi Leonard, and LaMarcus Aldridge, specifically. Obviously, the team still has plenty of talent, and a group of players more than capable of remaining as one of the top contenders in the tough Western Conference. Tack on a superb head coach in Gregg Popovich, and there's little reason to believe this team will take even a single step backwards in 2016-17.

As a matter-of-fact, we're here to argue just the opposite. We actually believe that the Spurs will be better next season, for a few different reasons. San Antonio is set up to do something special in 2016-17, which is to get back to the NBA Finals, and win yet another championship. How they do it, though, is going to be the fun part to talk about.

<h2>A new dynamic duo in San Antonio</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598518" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598518" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LaMarcus-Aldridge-Chris-Covatta-Getty-Images-640x424-640x424.jpg" alt="San Antonio Spurs" width="757" height="502" /> Chris Covatta/Getty Images[/caption]

It's sad seeing Duncan call it a career, but age finally caught up to him. Now, the attention shifts to Aldridge, who will be the main man inside, without question. But, the Spurs also made a huge offseason acquisition, and it's one that very few people are talking about. The fact that San Antonio was able to sign big-man Pau Gasol, will go a long way toward their push for another title.

The reason for that? There's probably not another team in the NBA who has two big men capable of slowing down a combo like Aldridge and Gasol. Aldridge is probably one of the best finishers in the NBA around the basket, and both he and Gasol have jump shots that can help stretch defenses on a consistent basis. Tack on the fact that Gasol is actually a very good passer for a big man, and you're looking at a one-two punch that's going to be pretty hard to stop.

And then, there was Kawhi.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>The rising star that is Kawhi Leonard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663681" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663681" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kawhi-Leonard-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x438.jpg" alt="Kawhi Leonard brings up the rock" width="757" height="517" /> Kawhi Leonard brings up the rock. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Leonard is the definition of a silent superstar. You never hear much from him, but he just goes out and produces. During the 2015-16 season, Leonard put together the best season of his career, averaging 21.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and one block-per-game. Essentially, he did everything you could possibly ask from a player. He's a lockdown defender, a scorer, can create his own shot, creates shots for others, and overall is just a great teammate.

Leonard's ability to improve in each and every season is very telling, and it's also a great sign for the Spurs as an organization. Possibly the two most important parts of Leonard's game are two things that don't get talked about as much as they should. The former San Diego State star takes smart shots (shot 50.6% from the field, and 44.3% from deep last season), and has no issue with guarding whichever superstar the Spurs are up against on any given night.

He's well-rounded, smart, has a motor that never stops, and very well may be one of the top five or six players in the NBA this coming season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Expectations for the Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_601373" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-601373" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Gregg-Popovich-San-Antonio-Spurs-v-Golden-X9ccDNoT3zyl.jpg" alt="San Antonio Spurs" width="757" height="482" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

In the end, the Spurs gained talent, even though they lost one of their all-time greats in Duncan. The addition of Gasol is going to cause matchup nightmares for opponents. In turn, expecting them to finish somewhere around the 65-win range once again this season seems realistic. While the Golden State Warriors, with newly-signed Kevin Durant are going to be the odds-on favorite, it's hard to imagine any two players on that roster being able to slow down the duo of Aldridge and Gasol.

A Western Conference Finals appearance is not only likely, but it seems expected. From there, don't be shocked if the Spurs are able to knock off whoever they face, and then get the job done in the NBA Finals.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Durant-Curry-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Is Kevin Durant Right About Stephen Curry's Shooting?" width="757" height="504" /> Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant stand on the court. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Following Game 2 of the NBA's Western Conference Finals, Kevin Durant -- superstar scorer of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who lost 91-118 to the Golden State Warriors -- decided to levy some critiques at two-time MVP and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-the-most-incredible-shots-of-his-career.html/" target="_blank">reigning champion of the "oh no he didn't, oh yes he did" basket</a>, Stephen Curry.

"He makes bad shots," <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/okc-thunder-kevin-durant-steph-curry-he-makes-bad-shots-golden-state-warriors-west-finals-051816" target="_blank">Durant told reporters after the game</a>, later adding that his own game could have benefited from a similar decision-making process: "I was trying to make the right pass, [m]aybe I've just got to shoot over three people."

If you feel like you've heard this before, it's because you have: Former Golden State head coach and current commentator Mark Jackson <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/mark-jackson-thinks-stephen-curry-is--hurting--basketball--warriors-don-t-agree-051804502.html" target="_blank">echoed this sentiment</a> back in December when he said that Curry's shooting was "hurting the game" with his prolific three-pointers.

It should be pointed out that in his playing days, Jackson's preferred method of scoring was to back his man down for 15-plus seconds toward the basket -- something you can't do anymore because it's boring as hell to watch. It's a style that was arguably just as damaging to the youth of the '90s as raining threes is today; that is to say, not at all.

(There's also the fact that Golden State's record and playoff success improved dramatically after they sent Jackson packing and brought in a head coach who, we can safely assume, is a much bigger fan of the deep ball than Action Jackson, but we're not here to be petty.)

Going back to Durant's comments on Curry's shooting, and for the record Steph scored 29 points on 15 shots in Game 2, nothing springs to mind more than the old pop culture koan: If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Or, in this case: If Curry is making bad shots, are they really bad shots at all? Let's examine.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Durant-Curry-J-Pat-Carter-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Is Kevin Durant Right About Stephen Curry's Shooting?" width="757" height="442" /> Kevin Durant stares into the Abyss, and Steph Curry stares back. | J Pat Carter/Getty Images[/caption]

First thing's first: Whenever people -- players, coaches, fans, pundits, despots, ghosts of basketball's past, doesn't matter -- say that Curry is taking (and making) bad shots, what they're really saying is that he's taking what would be considered bad shots<em> for anyone in the league not named Stephen Curry</em>.

This is a vitally important distinction, and one that gets lost in the shuffle, because Curry's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-is-stephen-curry-really-a-better-scorer-than-jordan.html/" target="_blank">shooting is so good</a> that he takes a nominally terrible shot and turns it into a good one. Don't believe us? The general rule of thumb is that shooting 33% from deep is as good as shooting 50% from within the three-point line, because the three is worth three points, go figure, and everything else is worth two.

If you make a pair of threes, you've scored the same number of points as if you'd made three two-point shots, and because basketball is a game where the object is to score as many points as possible (or at least more than the other team), making a pair of threes is just as valuable as dunking the ball three times. Simply put: if you can average 33% from outside, you're taking good shots.

For the 2016 playoffs, Curry is <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">averaging nearly 43%</a> from three-point land, well above <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html" target="_blank">the league average of 35%</a>. As anyone who has taken even a cursory glance at a Golden State game this season can confirm, these are not uncontested shots. Not only is Curry <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/OOBuZ" target="_blank">leading the league in postseason usage rate</a>, but he's been a focal point of every team's defense -- it's not as if his scoring acumen is a surprise at this point, and it's equally safe to say that a bad game from the MVP is the goal of whatever team is tasked with stopping him.

The problem, of course, is that nothing's worked, at least not reliably. But what about KD? He's no slouch in the scoring department, obviously (and if we're talking aesthetics, can we sidetrack for a minute to talk about how his one-time signature, the rip-through, is the lamest way to draw a shooting foul ever? No? OK.) So, how is the Slim Reaper fairing this postseason?

If you're going to cast the first stone, we're going to take a look into your glass house. Up there are the shot charts for Durant and Curry, and while they're overlaid at first, you can click on each player's name to see their individual performances. Looking at KD, it's clear that if either of the two should be taking harder shots, rather than making the right basketball play, it's the forward for the Thunder.

Durant is shooting a paltry 20 of 70 from beyond the arc in the playoffs so far. In fact, he's only really dominating with his shot near the hoop and to the left wing. While OKC is, in Durant's words, sending three guys at Curry on defense, he doesn't seem to be particularly effected, which can lead to frustration, and quotes that lead us toward discussions like these.

Of course, the idea that Durant should shoot less is, frankly, a little asinine. His scoring ability is one of Oklahoma City's biggest assets, and he doesn't possess the same sort of game that his other major contemporary, LeBron James -- who is 0-3 from deep against Atlanta and it hasn't mattered one iota-- can rely on when his shot isn't falling.

The same logic can be applied to Curry's shooting, with one key difference: Curry is still raining threes with no regard for human life. Durant's point rings close to the NCAA, in fact, when they banned dunking on account of Kareem, then Lew Alcindor. That ruling was foolish, and this idea of "making the right play" as a substitute for hitting shots no one else can compete with is equally dumb.

			<title>NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith</title>

		<description><![CDATA[J.R. Smith is one of the most intriguing NBA free agents remaining during the tumultuous NBA free agency period. Here are 5 places he'll most likely land.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[While there are quite a few talented NBA free agents still on the market, one of the most intriguing has to be former Cleveland Cavaliers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-free-agency-players-sign-already.html/" target="_blank">shooting guard J.R. Smith</a>. Smith wasn't dominant last season, but on a team with LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love, he didn't have to be. Smith averaged 12.4 points and 2.8 rebounds per game with the Cavaliers, and now he's commanding a pretty huge deal on the open market.

According to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/07/jr_smith_cavs_remain_apart_on.html" target="_blank">Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com</a>, Smith is looking to seal a deal worth around the $15 million mark, which may make it tough for the Cavs to sign him in the end. While Cleveland could technically lock him in -- assuming they do it before re-signing James -- it would cost them a serious amount of luxury tax. Now the question becomes, will they decide to do it? Let's look at five potential landing spots for Smith.
<h2>1. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570938" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570938" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/JR-Smith-Cleveland-Cavaliers.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith" width="757" height="478" /> J.R. Smith of the Cleveland Cavaliers warms up before Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Why not start back with the Cleveland Cavaliers? Obviously, this team would love to bring back Smith, but the question comes down to the luxury tax. Even though it wouldn't make financial sense for the team to do it, they likely want to keep together as much of their 2015<span class="s1">–</span>16 championship team as they possibly can. We sure would.

Life would be a lot easier for Smith too, because he gets quite a few open looks on this loaded team. It's pretty hard not to envision the Cleveland Cavaliers as the frontrunners for Smith, and it will be fun to watch how it all plays out this offseason.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Miami Heat</h2>
[caption id="attachment_605142" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-605142" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chris-Bosh-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith" width="757" height="517" /> Chris Bosh remains in Miami. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The Heat lost Dwyane Wade to the Chicago Bulls, and it left a pretty glaring need at the position for them. So, why not Smith? It'd make a whole lot of sense, and the Heat obviously have the money to pay him after failing to bring Wade back to town.

While there's no question that Wade is more talented than Smith as an all-around player, Smith would still bring a nice punch to the Heat offense. He would have a larger role with the team as well, compared to the one he had with the Cavaliers. Honestly, an ideal fit for Smith may wind up being the Heat, assuming that they're interested in signing the 13-year veteran.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Sacramento Kings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598943" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598943" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DeMarcus-Cousins-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith" width="757" height="485" /> DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

After the Kings decided to trade Marco Belinelli, the team acquired Arron Afflalo, and Ben McLemore, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't be interested in potentially adding another offensive piece. Losing Rajon Rondo will hurt, and there's still the chance that they could trade Rudy Gay. So overall, offensive pieces may not be easy to come by. It's tough to imagine the Kings as the most likely landing spot, but it's definitely still possible.

If the Kings have money to spend, are looking for a shooter, and can convince Smith to come to town, this match would be interesting to watch. With that said, if Gay and Afflalo are both there, the addition of Smith may not work out so well.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661288" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ben-Simmons-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith" width="757" height="505" /> Ben Simmons is interviewed at the 2016 NBA Draft. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

On paper, the decision to add a player like Smith into a mix of such a young group wouldn't make much sense. But, the bulk of the 76ers' talent is actually big men, and then Ben Simmons, who can play a wide range of positions. At shooting guard, the 76ers have Nik Stauskas, and Gerald Henderson, neither of which really move the needle all that much.

Philadelphia could definitely use a playmaker like Smith, especially one who can benefit from the other young players who have the ability to open things up for him. Don't sleep on the 76ers possibly considering Smith.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Brooklyn Nets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671884" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671884" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Brook-Lopez-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Potential Landing Spots for J.R. Smith" width="757" height="542" /> Brook Lopez's reaction says it all. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

After the Nets unfortunately lost out on both Allen Crabbe and Tyler Johnson, the team has plenty of money left to spend. Let's also not forget the fact that the Nets essentially have no set starter at shooting guard. In turn, this would make a whole lot of sense for the team.

While the Nets aren't the most exciting team out there, he'd still be able to get a ton of shots up, while having the potential to put together one of the best seasons of his entire career. We'd love to see him land on this Nets team, and he'd probably be a huge fan if he's looking to put up big numbers. Keep an eye on the Nets as a potential landing spot.

		<description><![CDATA[Many NBA teams added talented free agents to improve their standings during the 2016 offseason, but which 5 teams improved most when all was said and done?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sure, Kevin Durant signed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors.html/" target="_blank">with the Golden State Warriors</a>, but the question is, exactly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-free-agency-winners-losers.html/" target="_blank">how much did they improve</a> in the process? Did they make enough of a jump to qualify as one of the teams who massively improved this offseason? That's just one of the many questions that we answer here.

We're going to take a look at the five teams that improved most during the 2016 NBA offseason. We'll not only <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nba-free-agency-names-landed.html/" target="_blank">factor in free agency</a>, but the NBA draft as well. Let's start with a team that was just one big man away from being a serious contender. Thankfully, that team now looks ready to push the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference.
<h2>1. Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_665786" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-665786" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Boston-Celtics-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams That Massively Improved During the 2016 Offseason" width="757" height="511" /> Isaiah Thomas (R) celebrates with Marcus Smart (C) and Jae Crowder during the NBA playoffs. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

To be brutally honest, this one comes down to one player, Al Horford. Signing Horford was a serious game-changer for this team. Not only did the Celtics know what they needed this offseason, but it seems apparent that Horford saw the opportunity he has in Boston. He makes this team a legitimate title contender once again, with the rest of the roster rounded out pretty nicely.

The Celtics also added a beautiful draft haul that featured a ridiculous eight picks. It seemed like every time you blinked, Boston was back on the clock during the 2016 NBA Draft. Their most talked about pick is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-won-nba-draft-night.html/" target="_blank">Jaylen Brown from California</a> at No. 3. If he comes into his own early, Brown could be an interesting prospect. The addition of Demetrius Jackson in the second round was also nice, but is a bit overlooked.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Golden State Warriors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_665786" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-665786" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Steve-Kerr-Golden-State-Warriors-Kevin-Durant-640x432.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams That Massively Improved During the 2016 Offseason" width="757" height="511" /> Head coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors sits with Kevin Durant during the press conference where Durant was introduced as a Golden State Warrior. | Thearon W.

To everyone out there who completely hates the Warriors largely due to the fact that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-kevin-durant-win-73-games.html/" target="_blank">they are loaded</a>, we're sorry. Golden State just has too much talent, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-underrated-free-agent-signings.html/" target="_blank">with Zaza Pachulia</a> and David West both joining up with the Warriors, it makes them even more interesting.

Overall, when your starting lineup features Stephen Curry, Durant, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, it's hard to argue with the fact that this team had a ridiculously great offseason. Yes, the Warriors lost some of their depth in the process, but we can't ignore what signing Durant alone truly brings to this team and this roster. They're absolutely improved heading into the 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. New York Knicks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_597613" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-597613" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Carmelo-Anthony-Elsa-Getty-Images-640x498.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams That Massively Improved During the 2016 Offseason" width="757" height="590" /> Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

People don't really want to tip their cap in the direction of the Knicks for some reason, but this doesn't make much sense. Phil Jackson made it known that he was going to make the Knicks a contending team, and they took a step toward doing that in the 2016 NBA offseason. While New York probably won't contend for a championship next season, they're still better than they were last year.

A starting lineup of Carmelo Anthony, Kristaps Porzingis, Derrick Rose, Courtney Lee, and Joakim Noah -- with Brandon Jennings first off the bench -- is strong enough to get the Knicks back to the postseason for the first time since 2012–13.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Indiana Pacers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594015" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594015" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Larry-Bird-JOHN-MOTTERN-AFP-Getty-Images-640x451.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams That Massively Improved During the 2016 Offseason" width="757" height="533" /> Larry Bird, head coach of the Indiana Pacers | John Mottern/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Pacers are another team getting largely overlooked for their strong offseason. It seems like no one wants to talk about the addition of Jeff Teague or Thaddeus Young. Instead, we're hearing about the losses of Ian Mahinmi and George Hill. Myles Turner can fill in Mahinmi's role just fine, while Young and Teague are both major offensive upgrades.

The Pacers also added a strong inside man in Al Jefferson (although he's set to come down the home stretch of his career). One way or another, it's hard to argue that the Pacers aren't sitting in a better spot than they were last season. Oh, let's not forget about Paul George, because the biggest star is still in Indiana.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_601373" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-601373" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Gregg-Popovich-San-Antonio-Spurs-v-Golden-X9ccDNoT3zyl.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams That Massively Improved During the 2016 Offseason" width="757" height="482" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tim-duncan-greatest-power-forward-history.html/" target="_blank">loss of Tim Duncan</a> is really sad, because the whole NBA will miss him. He <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-performances-tim-duncans-nba-career.html/" target="_blank">was a legend</a>, a great player, great teammate, and beloved by the fans. In terms of the Spurs' outlook in 2016–17 though, it's pretty beautiful. The franchise, by signing Pau Gasol, has set the Spurs up to have a three-headed monster that includes Gasol, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Kawhi Leonard.

If you had a guess, what will be the best (and possibly only way) to beat the Warriors in a seven-game series? It's probably a pretty safe bet that it'll have something to do with a dominate inside game, which the Spurs absolutely have now. The Gasol signing is overlooked, and the Spurs didn't do a ton besides that, but we truly believe it makes a much, much better team; one that can contend for a championship.

		<description><![CDATA[Now that he's announced his retirement from professional basketball and the Lakers look to be in the lottery, could this have been the worst possible outcome?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_776806" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-776806 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Nash-Kevork-Djansezisan-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: Was the 'Steve Nash Deal' One of the Worst Trades Ever?" width="757" height="528" /> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-trade-rumors-5-players-who-may-be-traded-before-the-deadline.html/" target="_blank">the 2016 Trade Deadline just days away</a>, we ask you to think back to a not-so-distant time. The 2012 Los Angeles Lakers could’ve really been something. In a perfect world (or at least, ESPN’s perfect world) the Lakers would’ve matched up against the Miami Heat, and the NBA would’ve finally had its much anticipated but never actualized Kobe/LeBron finals. James, who would’ve been in the second year of his Miami vacation, would’ve been flanked by Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, while Kobe would’ve had Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol, and Steve Nash. Given good health on both sides, it’s hard to imagine which team would’ve come out on top.

What if, indeed. Kobe’s still in Los Angeles, but Dwight fled to Texas and Nash took up permanent residence on the injured reserve — frustrating all parties involved both personally and professionally, but perhaps none more than the Lakers. L.A., who had effortlessly coasted from championship roster to championship roster for about 30 years leading up to the Nash trade, had sent four draft picks to Phoenix in exchange for the two-time MVP award winner. At the time of his retirement, Nash <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashst01.html" target="_blank">had played just 65 games in purple and gold</a>.

The picks sent out by L.A. haven’t netted Phoenix a great deal of return yet (unless you’re really excited about Brandon Wright or Brandon Knight, both acquired with some of those picks), but they’re certainly going to be more valuable to the Suns than Nash was to Los Angeles. Was the trade for a guy who had his career <a href="https://twitter.com/AminESPN/status/579813992769683456" target="_blank">eulogized by former teammate</a> Dirk Nowitzki as “injured, and being slow, and white and unathletic" the worst trade for a potential star ever?

Brazziell-Pool/Getty Images[/caption]

We’re almost obligated to mention the Bill Russell trade here, since he’s the most successful player in NBA history and he <a href="http://wagesofwins.com/2010/06/15/trading-the-ice-capades-for-bill-russell/" target="_blank">was rather famously traded for a now-defunct figure skating group</a> (alongside Ed Macauley, Cliff Hagan, and the seventh overall pick of that year), but that’s unfair for a few reasons, most important of which is the dramatic difference in the NBA of the 1950s and the NBA of today. The St. Louis Hawks and the Rochester Royals didn’t know what was going on with Russell — that’s hardly the case for Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Closer corollaries might be the Paul Pierce/Kevin Garnett trade, which brought Boston an army of assets, or the Dwight Howard trade, wherein the Lakers sent out their 2017 first round pick along with Andrew Bynum into a four-team deal that went pretty poorly for all parties involved <a href="http://fansided.com/2014/08/24/nba-revisiting-dwight-howard-trade/" target="_blank">except the Magic</a>. Bynum was a nonfactor for the 76ers, so he’s the closest to Nash in terms of on-the-floor production, and his lackluster season precipitated the tanking efforts that we now associate with Philly, but the Sixers sent beloved wing Andre Iguodala out in the deal, so they certainly gave away more than the Lakers have. Iggy’s still in the league, too: Filling in the cracks for an on-fire Golden State Warriors squad and ultimately earning the NBA Finals MVP award with the Bay Area team.

For his announcement, Nash took to Derek Jeter’s PR platform The Players’ Tribune to talk about what life was going to be like without NBA basketball. It’s <a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/steve-nash-retirement/" target="_blank">an interesting, if surface level, read</a>. In it, he discusses signing with LA as a way to “be in the ‘fire,’ and play for high risk and high reward in my last NBA chapter," at the expense of other, more lucrative deals. While the 2012 Los Angeles Lakers were prohibitive title favorites on paper, we’ll always remember them for Steve Nash’s broken leg, Dwight’s candy addiction, and the way Southern California’s premier basketball team collapsed under the weight of its own expectations.

		<description><![CDATA[Golden State may be loaded for the 2016–17 season, but they have weaknesses — and these 5 teams could still beat the Warriors next season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Golden State Warriors are officially the juggernaut of the NBA. They may have been one of the league's two elite teams before this offseason, but now there's simply no question that the free-agent <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors.html/" target="_blank">addition of Kevin Durant</a> makes them the team to beat next season.

The question now becomes, who can beat the Warriors in the regular-season, and can <em>anyone</em> beat this team in a seven-game series? Good news, NBA fans, there are some teams that can take down Golden State next season, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/kevin-durant-warriors-nba-title-odds.html/" target="_blank">even with Durant</a>, but it won't be an easy task. Let's check out the five teams who can beat the Warriors.
<h2>1. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_651809" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-651809" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeBron-James-and-Stephen-Curry-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams Who Can Still Beat the Warriors in 2016–17" width="757" height="558" /> LeBron James looks to drive past Stephen Curry in the 2016 NBA Finals. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Hey, fun fact. The Cavaliers are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cleveland-paid-team-eastern-conference.html/" target="_blank">still the NBA champions</a>, even if the past few days caused people to forget about it. As we all know, this is a team loaded with talent, including LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-possible-landing-spots-kevin-love.html/" target="_blank">we'll see about the latter</a>). Tack on the fact that the Cavaliers now have another season of experience together, and it's obvious why Cleveland should be plenty excited about their potential to push for a repeat championship in 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17.

While the Warriors will still give them a major roadblock, there's no reason the Cavaliers can't push through and steal a seven-game series from them once again. We were skeptical at first, but it's hard not to buy into what <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stats-lebron-james-2016-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank">James and company</a> are selling after witnessing the 2016 NBA Playoffs.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598518" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598518" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LaMarcus-Aldridge-Chris-Covatta-Getty-Images-640x424-640x424.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams Who Can Still Beat the Warriors in 2016–17" width="757" height="502" /> San Antonio Spurs power forward LaMarcus Aldridge | Chris Covatta/Getty Images[/caption]

Yes, the Spurs are one year older, but they just added a piece who will make life massively difficult for the Warriors in 2016–17. While LaMarcus Aldridge alone creates a headache for opponents, the Spurs can now <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-free-agency-winners-losers.html/" target="_blank">pair him with Pau Gasol</a>, making life brutal for teams who don't have strong defensive big men (like the Warriors).

Golden State may be able to score a ton of points with their new four-headed monster, but neither Durant nor Draymond Green will be able to shut down the duo of Aldridge and Gasol.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598518" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598518" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Russell-Westbrook_Oklahoma-City-Thunder.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams Who Can Still Beat the Warriors in 2016–17" width="757" height="502" /> Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Oh yes, you're reading this one right. With Durant leaving town, no one really wants to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/twitter-reactions-kevin-durant-warriors.html/" target="_blank">talk about the Thunder anymore</a>. It's simply assumed that they'll take massive steps backwards in 2016–17. But think about this for a minute.

If the Thunder happened to draw the Warriors in one of the first two opening rounds of the 2017 NBA Playoffs, could you imagine the level of motivation Oklahoma City would have as they face this "super team?" It would be on a whole new level, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-landing-spots-russell-westbrook.html/" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a> would do anything in his power to get the upset.

Beyond the revenge factor, the combo of Steven Adams and Enes Kanter inside could make life absolutely brutal for the Warriors. One of the key reasons why the Thunder lost to Golden State in the 2016 NBA Playoffs is because they moved away from that big-man duo, which won't happen if they square off next year.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_631087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-631087 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IsaiahThomasAtlantaHawksvBostonCelticsAiP6JAjXPpDl-1.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams Who Can Still Beat the Warriors in 2016–17" width="757" height="500" /> Boston Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

There's a lot to love about the Celtics: A ton of young talent through the draft; Isaiah Thomas; one of the more intriguing backcourts in the NBA; and now, finally, a big man to complement all of that guard talent. Landing Al Horford was an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-best-free-agents-2016.html/" target="_blank">absolutely massive move</a> for the Celtics this offseason, which could make them a serious contender in the Eastern Conference.

Now, assuming they can get past the Cleveland Cavaliers, what makes us think they can't do the same against the Warriors in an NBA finals series? It's obviously an uphill climb, but hey, the Celtics are well-coached and have a strong core. They can compete -- and maybe even beat the Warriors.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_632958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632958" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Chris-Paul-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Image.jpg" alt="NBA: 5 Teams Who Can Still Beat the Warriors in 2016–17" width="757" height="563" /> Chris Paul waits for the play to begin. | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

If only the Clippers could manage to stay healthy... This team has tremendous upside, led by stars <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">Chris Paul</a>, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan. The simple fact is the duo of Griffin and Jordan inside could be a nightmare for the Warriors next season.

To go along with that, the Clippers also have outside shooting with Jamal Crawford, J.J. Redick, and of course Paul, which can enable them to do plenty in terms of keeping up with Golden State. If the Clippers can stay healthy next season, they could give the Warriors a serious run for their money out West.

		<description><![CDATA[With the NBA's salary cap exploding, teams have tons of space to make trades for the players they need. Here are 5 NBA trade possibilities.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2016-nba-draft/" target="_blank">2016 NBA Draft</a> is over, teams are fixing their eyes on free agency. With the salary cap rising to around $94 million this offseason, the majority of the NBA will have tons of space free to bring in quality help. Of course, there won’t be enough talent on the market to satisfy everyone’s needs, so inevitably some teams are looking to trade for talent after missing out on Kevin Durant, DeMar Derozen, Bradley Beal, and others.

So which players are on their way out with their respective teams and could be acquired via trade, much like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-bulls-trade-derrick-rose.html/" target="_blank">Derrick Rose with the Knicks</a> last week? Here are our top five players who could be available.
<h2>5. Taj Gibson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_617388" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-617388" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Kristaps-Johnathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 5 Big Players Who Could Move" width="757" height="492" /> Taj Gibson guards Kristaps Porzingis. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Rose's trade was a necessary move for many reasons, but it takes the Chicago Bulls in a vague direction. They’re trying to fit their roster to head coach Fred Hoiberg’s run-and-shoot style of offense, but they also appear perfectly happy to start rebuilding too.

Unfortunately for Taj Gibson, he could be sent packing either way. Gibson is a 31-year-old forward with one more year remaining on his contract at $8.9 million -- a bargain in the new financial climate of the NBA. He’s a strong defender and a decent rebounder with some offensive skills.

Although Gibson is not a starter on a contending team, but you could definitely do worse than him as your first big man off the bench. Look for veteran teams like the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder to consider adding him.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Ricky Rubio</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ricky-Rubio-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 5 Big Players Who Could Move" width="756" height="475" /> Ricky Rubio dribbles the ball against Deron Williams. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Ricky Rubio was rumored to be on the outs in Minnesota all season and heading into the offseason. Then, when point guard Kris Dunn fell to the Timberwolves in the draft, Rubio’s fate was sealed.

Supposedly, the Wolves offered Rubio in several trades during the draft -- including in a deal with <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242402/Wolves-Offered-No-5-Ricky-Rubio-To-Bulls-For-Jimmy-Butler-Before-Kris-Dunn-Slid" target="_blank">Dunn heading to the Chicago Bulls</a>. Ultimately, it didn’t pan out, and Minnesota was left with both Rubio and Dunn -- not to mention combo guard Zach LaVine -- on the roster. Rubio has never emerged as much of an offensive threat, but he certainly is a good passer who can run an offense.

He’d be a much better fit in a system with established scorers already on the roster, where the team can hide his shooting deficiencies. Logical teams that could acquire Rubio include the Houston Rockets or the Sacramento Kings -- assuming that Rajon Rondo doesn’t return.

<h2>3. Greg Monroe</h2>

Rumor has it that Greg Monroe is <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/242319/Bucks-Expected-To-Trade-Greg-Monroe" target="_blank">on his way out with the Milwaukee Bucks</a>, just one year after signing a three-year, $51 million contract. Monroe is a talented power forward but fit awkwardly with the athletic Bucks, so much so that Milwaukee thinks his presence on the roster is more of a negative than a positive in their move toward returning to the playoffs in 2016-17.

The interesting part is that Monroe is a solid player in the right system. The problem is finding the right team to take him and also give up something of value in return. It seems unlikely that the Bucks will get anything more than a late-round draft pick and some bench filler. The Thunder could be a fit here, having just traded Serge Ibaka.

<h2>2. Eric Bledsoe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587673" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587673" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eric-Bledsoe-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Phoenix-IpE8rEctC6Jl.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 5 Big Players Who Could Move" width="757" height="505" /> Eric Bledsoe rises for a three-pointer against the Los Angeles Lakers. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Last season, Eric Bledsoe was having the best year of his career, but then it was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-eric-bledsoes-injury-hurts-the-suns-playoff-chances.html/" target="_blank">cut short by a torn meniscus</a> after just 31 games. Bledsoe had career bests in shooting percentage and points per game, and looks ready for training camp this season.

So why would the Suns want to trade a 27-year-old established point guard? In part, it’s because the younger, more promising Brandon Knight is on the roster, and the Suns have him locked up for the next four years at $58 million.

It also involves the emergence of Devin Booker, the 19-year-old rookie that took over in Bledsoe’s absence. Booker averaged 17.9 points in 34.7 minutes after Bledsoe’s knew injury. Teams that could be interested in Bledsoe include the Bulls, Kings, and Boston Celtics.

<h2>1. Jimmy Butler</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595400" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595400" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-503125338-Jimmy-Butler-Chicago-Bulls.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 5 Big Players Who Could Move" width="757" height="570" /> Jimmy Butler drives past Carmelo Anthony. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Jimmy Butler is the big name on the list, but he’s also the least likely to move in a trade. The Bulls are teetering on the edge of a complete rebuild, and trading Butler would push them over. It’s not completely known just how close they got to doing it on draft night, but there were plenty of rumors floating around about potential deals with the Celtics and the Timberwolves.

In the end, Butler remained with Chicago. But if the Bulls were intently listening during the draft, there’s no reason to believe they won’t listen again after the big free agents move. Butler is one of the top players at the shooting guard position in the NBA, bringing the rare combination of elite defense and the ability to score.

At just 27 years old, he’s both highly valuable and highly coveted. It would take a lot -- both draft picks and young, established players -- but the Bulls would certainly trade him if it improved them long-term. The Celtics, Timberwolves, and just about any other fringe contender would likely be interested.

		<description><![CDATA[The 2016 NBA free agency class is loaded with talent, but which players will stay with their current teams and which will leave town?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_961525" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-961525" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kevin-Durant-Oklahoma-City-Thunder.jpg" alt="NBA: Which 2016 Free Agents Will Stay and Which Will Go?" width="757" height="504" /> Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Although many fans are focused on the outcome of the <a title="2016 NBA Playoffs" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-most-intriguing-potential-early-playoff-matchups.html/" target="_blank">2016 NBA Playoffs</a>, there’s no way we can overlook the impending free agency this offseason. It’s loaded with some impressive talent, as well as many questions about which players will stay with their current teams and which will leave town. Today we check out the top impending free agents, and break down who will likely remain with their current team and which players will head out of town for a huge payday.
<h2>Kevin Durant</h2>
Let’s clarify this right out of the gate: If Kevin Durant leaves the Oklahoma City Thunder, they’d be stunned. He and Russell Westbrook have built a strong rapport, and we’d be shocked to see him depart. He will get a max deal anywhere he goes, but home is where the heart is, and he has some unfinished business in Oklahoma City.

While Durant may meet with a few other teams and will likely consider moving, in the end, he’ll return to the Thunder. The only way he may not? A first-round exit from the 2016 NBA Playoffs that really, really frustrates him.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Stays in Oklahoma City
<h2>LeBron James</h2>
LeBron James doesn’t even fully qualify as a free agent, but we’ll consider him one because of his player option. To keep this short, sweet, and simple, James will likely opt out of his contract, and then sign another deal with the team. To see James leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and devastate that fanbase once again would be absolutely stunning. Expect James back in Cleveland, even if it’s on another one-year deal.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Stays in Cleveland

<h2>Andre Drummond (Restricted)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_944867" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-944867" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Andre-Drummond-Detroit-Pistons-v-Atlanta-Hawks-7pjudD7iikil.jpg" alt="NBA: Which 2016 Free Agents Will Stay and Which Will Go?" width="757" height="505" /> Andre Drummond of the Detroit Pistons | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

No matter what any team offers Andre Drummond, it’s hard to imagine the Detroit Pistons not matching it. Drummond proves to be one of the best centers in the NBA — and this is in a league where finding dominant centers isn’t an easy task. The Pistons are building something pretty strong, and while they may still be a year or two away from really contending, Drummond will be a part of that future. The Pistons won’t let the big man leave town, and there’s not a major reason for him to leave, either.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Stays in Detroit
<h2>DeMar DeRozan</h2>
DeMar DeRozan is another player who has a player option, but it’s widely expected that he’ll choose to head to free agency and then sign a max contract somewhere. The most likely spots would be with either be re-signing with the Toronto Raptors, or heading back home and playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, who’ll have a boatload of money to spend. If we had to take a guess, expect to see DeRozan lured to Los Angeles with the idea that he could be the face of that franchise and help turn around a struggling franchise that was once one of the best in the NBA.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Goes

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Pau Gasol</h2>
[caption id="attachment_943239" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-943239" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-503472564-Pau-Gasol-Chicago-Bulls.jpg" alt="NBA: Which 2016 Free Agents Will Stay and Which Will Go?" width="757" height="580" /> Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Pau Gasol has a player option as well, but at the age of 35, it’s likely that he’ll opt out and look to get a huge contract from someone. He wants to play for a contender, and if the Chicago Bulls really wanted to get Gasol back, they probably could. Unfortunately, after all of the trade rumors, the Bulls seem likely to go a different direction, meaning that Gasol will likely sign for a contender somewhere and give himself a chance to get another ring. Where he’ll land? Well, that all depends on how free agency plays out, but he could have a pretty big market when all is said and done.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Goes
<h2>Al Horford</h2>
Seeing as how the Atlanta Hawks were looking to move Horford pretty consistently as the 2016 NBA trade deadline was looming, it seems likely that he won’t return to Atlanta for another season. The veteran center is incredibly talented, and actually seems to fly under the radar just a bit. Horford is only 29 years old, and many people seem to forget that. He’s in store for a pretty huge pay day more than likely, but we don’t believe that it’ll be with the Hawks. Expect him to play elsewhere in 2017.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Goes

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Mike Conley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_793592" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-793592 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mike-Conley_Memphis-Grizzlies-e1430222947661.jpg" alt="NBA: Which 2016 Free Agents Will Stay and Which Will Go?" width="757" height="504" /> Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

Anyone in the market for a 28-year-old point guard who should definitely be considered on an “all-star" level? You can bet that he’ll have a pretty big market, but one of those teams who’ll likely be after his talents will be the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizz should absolutely want to keep Mike Conley, and if that wasn’t obvious before, it is after watching multiple players attempt to replace him as he’s been injured to finish out the 2015-16 NBA season. Conley’s a big name, and he’s going to get a pretty huge pay raise this coming offseason, likely from Memphis.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Stays with Memphis
<h2>Hassan Whiteside/Dwyane Wade</h2>
We’re pairing these two together for one simple reason: Both will return to the Miami Heat in 2017. The reasons why they return, though, are completely different. For Hassan Whiteside, he proves to be one of the more impressive forces inside this season, averaging 14.1 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 3.8 blocks through his 68 games played to this point in the season.

The Heat simply need to keep Whiteside, because what he brings to the table is too much to pass up. He will get a massive deal, but we should expect Miami to be the ones to pay up in order to keep him. As for Dwyane Wade, he’ll finish out his career with the Heat, as he should. He’s 34 years old and hasn’t been as dominant as we’ve seen years ago. However, he still averages over 19 points per game, with 4.7 assists and 4.1 rebounds. Wade will likely sign one more deal with the Heat, and then hang it up when that contract comes to a close.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Consensus</span>: Both stay with Miami

		<description><![CDATA[Here are the top three landing destinations in free agency this summer for Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_778563" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-778563 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kevin-Durant1-e1427393862332.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="510" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/nba-playoffs/" target="_blank">2015-16 NBA Playoffs</a> may have just finished, but that doesn’t stop the long-running conversation about Oklahoma City Thunder star forward Kevin Durant’s pending free agency next summer. The 27-year-old will head into the first offseason in his NBA career as an unrestricted free agent, and will undoubtedly receive plenty of interest from many teams across the league, particularly after OKC dealt Serge Ibaka to the Orlando Magic.

Durant appears to have finally returned to elite-level status after dealing with foot issues for much of last season. He is arguably one of the five best players in the NBA and is just entering the prime years of his career.  Here are our top three picks for Durant’s destination in 2016.
<h2>3. Houston Rockets</h2>
Since Daryl Morey has taken over the duties as the team’s general manager, the Rockets have been active in the player-acquisition department, to put it mildly. So far, Morey has not let a single trade deadline pass without making at least one move on that day, but it isn’t just shuffling players you’ve never heard of for picks or trade exemptions.

Indeed, over the past four seasons Houston has continued to make splashy moves such as acquiring James Harden from Oklahoma City, signing Dwight Howard, and trading for Ty Lawson from the Denver Nuggets. They are constantly looking for ways to improve the team in order to stay in the title contention picture and don’t appear to be fearful of the luxury tax.

Durant still holds a strong relationship with Harden since his departure from the Thunder and has spoken highly of the Rockets’ organization in the past. There are still a few cap-space hoops for Houston to jump through, but if Durant were serious about joining the team, this shouldn’t be an issue.

Remember, the Rockets reshaped their entire roster for Howard (twice) and eventually landed him when he became an unrestricted free agent. Ultimately, this all makes Houston a dark horse in the Durant sweepstakes next offseason.

<h2>2. Washington Wizards</h2>
[caption id="attachment_796262" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-796262 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Washington-Wizards-e1430749819794.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

</div>
First and foremost, the Wizards hold one thing over every other potential suitor for Durant next summer: the opportunity to play for his hometown team. Washington also possesses a talented roster that is headlined by one of the league’s best backcourts in John Wall and Bradley Beal.

Wall has come into his own over the past couple seasons as an All-Star-caliber point guard and proven scorer with a pass-first mentality. Beal continues to develop into one of the great shooters in the league -- his shot is so clean you wouldn’t be mistaken for thinking he was reminiscent of a young Ray Allen.

That said, Durant would immediately jump aboard as the face of the franchise and primary scoring option of the team. It also helps that he would play in a weaker Eastern Conference that could put him in title contention. In other words, outlandish as it may seem, the Wizards do pose a realistic threat to the next team in nabbing Durant in free agency.
<h2>1. Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789893" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789893 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin-Durant-and-Russell-Westbrook-e1429526700499.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Throughout this entire process, Durant has never wavered on his desire to remain in a Thunder uniform. He has continued to show his loyalty to the franchise that drafted him, <a href="https://www.nbasocial.com/rumors/kevin-durant-prefers-joining-golden-state-warriors-leaves-okc/" target="_blank">even if he has gone on the record saying that if he goes anywhere else, he'd like it to be the Warriors.</a>

What also helps Oklahoma City’s case is that they possess another top-five player in four-time All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook, who took his game to another level last season with Durant sidelined due to injury. The Thunder duo has helped make the organization into an NBA title contender year in and year out as they've build an extremely tight bond with each other over their eight seasons together.

What also helps the Thunder is that they have the benefit of offering Durant the most lucrative contract in free agency due to holding his Bird Rights. All in all, Oklahoma City is where the six-time All-Star established himself and brought the franchise to prominence in the league. It wouldn’t be one bit of a surprise if he decided to stay put next offseason.

		<description><![CDATA[Dwight Howard just opted out of his contract with the Rockets. We think he should return to the Lakers. Seriously.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_640144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwight-Howard-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: Why Dwight Howard Should Return to the LA Lakers" width="757" height="457" /> Dwight Howard walks off the floor during a game against the Spurs. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Given all the excitement of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2016-nba-playoffs/" target="_blank">2016 NBA Playoffs</a>, we suspect that the attention of most basketball fans is still firmly fixed on the just-concluded postseason. <span class="message_body">That's totally understandable, but it would be silly to ignore the shifting plates that will define the NBA landscape</span> for seasons to come.

Some teams on the sidelines <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/head-coach-candidates-orlando-magic.html/" target="_blank">are scrambling to find their next head coach</a>, and all of them are looking ahead to the NBA draft, which is is right around the corner. And that's before you realize that everyone's trying to guess where the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nba-mock-draft-pre-lottery-edition.html/" target="_blank">next wave of potential superstars will land</a>. As you can see, this is a pretty full plate we have here.

The way we see it, the overarching theme of this time of year in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank">National Basketball Association</a> is change. And for those players currently suiting up in the league, this motif will have a strong effect on their futures as well. Particularly those individuals -- the best of the best -- who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-nba-players-who-could-opt-to-become-free-agents.html/" target="_blank">can opt out of their contracts</a> and become free agents. One of these players is none other than Houston's Dwight Howard, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--dwight-howard-declines-option--enters-free-agency-214823768.html" target="_blank">who will indeed enter free agency</a>.

Given the overwhelming public drama associated with the Rockets this season -- coupled with the center's undeniable tension with superstar shooting guard <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/james-harden/" target="_blank">James Harden</a> -- it's safe to assume that D12, who had a 2016 player option with Houston, will play with another team come the 2016–17 season. And that is a good thing. Howard is in desperate need of a fresh start. Yet, as crazy as it may sound, we think the perfect place for the eight-time All-Star to start over is with a team he's already played for: the Los Angeles Lakers.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_640172" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640172" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dwight-Howard-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="NBA: Why Dwight Howard Should Return to the LA Lakers" width="757" height="452" /> Dwight Howard (R) drives to the basket against the Lakers. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

You laugh. We get it. Howard's <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/howardw01.html" target="_blank">last Hollywood venture</a> was far from sunshine and roses. His work ethic -- or lack thereof -- caused tension between him and the Mamba, and Howard never gave the impression that he had any interest in adding his name to the long list of historically great Lakers centers.

This sort of apathy does not sit well with a fan base that believes it's this organization's manifest destiny to win titles and add banners to the rafters. Howard simply wasn't prepared to be the player this team needed. But that particular Lakers team is gone. And that changes everything.

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> is arguably the greatest player to ever sport the purple and gold. But just because he and Howard were never able to co-exist doesn't mean the center wasn't the right fit for Los Angeles. With Bryant calling it a career, the Lakers now find themselves flush with talented youth -- Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson, and D'Angelo Russell -- and no established superstar to help this group reach its potential.

While you might feel that Howard is ill-equipped to handle such a responsibility, we beg to differ. And the reason is simple: Luke Walton. Although Walton has never been a full-time NBA coach before, we all saw what he was capable of while holding the interim tag for the Golden State Warriors. We don't care how good this Dubs team is, leading anyone to a 39-4 mark deserves its proper due.

By <a href="http://www.nba.com/2016/news/04/29/lakers-hire-luke-walton-to-be-head-coach/" target="_blank">hiring Walton to be their next head coach</a>, the Lakers showed that they are <em>finally</em> ready to embrace the modern game and not just rest on the supposed power of their "brand." In Golden State, Walton learned firsthand what it takes to get the maximum out of players individually, while also doing what's in the best interest of the group as a whole. This is what he'll bring to Los Angeles. And this is what Howard desperately needs.

Coming off of a back surgery, Howard still managed to put up 17.1 points and a league-leading 12.4 rebounds per game during his stint with the Lakers. But he was never going to be <em>the guy</em>. That position was filled. During his time in Houston, D12 has come across the same issue. Perhaps it's time that he stops feeling the need to be <em>the guy</em>, and embrace being <em>one</em> of the guys. With a youthful roster and a forward-thinking new head coach, the Lakers provide this opportunity. Howard's story can still have a Hollywood ending. He just needs to rewrite the script.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_495392" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-495392" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Derrick-Rose-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: Some Possible Destinations for the Bulls to Trade Derrick Rose" width="757" height="568" /> Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

The Chicago Bulls have made no secret of the fact that they need to take a hard look at their roster and make some serious changes going into the future. Along with head coach Fred Hoiberg, the Bulls have a few building blocks locked into place for the next several years -- star shooting guard Jimmy Butler being the biggest name. While they certainly won’t be the only team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-boston-celtics-could-trade.html/" target="_blank">this offseason looking to make a splash</a>, the Bulls will probably have to make several trades to improve their roster.

And that starts with former-MVP Derrick Rose. By now, most know the tragic story of Rose; he won the league MVP award in 2010-11 at the tender, young age of 21, tore his ACL in the first game of the 2011-12 playoffs, missed all of 2012-13, played only 10 games in 2013-14 before tearing his meniscus, and ended up having a second surgery on his meniscus in 2014-15 and was limited to just 51 games played.

To say that it’s been an up-and-down journey for Rose the last few years is being kind. Not only has he played out his massive contract extension that he signed in December 2011 mostly on the inactive list, but his speed, agility, and productivity have dropped off.

Add to that the fact that the circumstances surrounding his return from injuries and the state of the team on the court have made for a tense relationship with the front office, and it’s reasonable to admit that it might be time for the Bulls to part with Rose -- if that’s even possible. If the Bulls do decide to go that route, there are a few teams that could be a realistic landing spot for Rose.

<em>[Update 6/22: The Knicks, who we had not featured as one of the teams most likely to trade for Rose, are <a href="https://twitter.com/WojVerticalNBA/status/745695860189728768?lang=en" target="_blank">reportedly in talks with the Bulls regarding the Chicago point guard</a>.  This post will be updated if/when Rose is dealt. Welcome to the NBA offseason.]</em>

<em>[Update II 6/22: The trade with the Knicks went through. While details are still unclear the pieces involved appear to be Rose, Robin Lopez, Jerian Grant and Jose Calderon, <a href="https://twitter.com/WojVerticalNBA/status/745696616531828737" target="_blank">per Adrian Wojnarowski</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/745697600481918976" target="_blank">Shams Charania</a>.]</em>

<h2>1. Dallas Mavericks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_518645" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-518645" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dirk-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA: Some Possible Destinations for the Bulls to Trade Derrick Rose" width="757" height="504" /> Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks celebrates during play against the San Antonio Spurs in Game Six of the Western Conference Quarterfinals during the 2014 NBA Playoffs. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The Mavericks had Dallas native point guard Deron Williams on their roster this season, and although he’s already made it clear he intends to opt out of the remainder of his deal there’s a reasonable chance that he could be returning to the Mavs next season. But rather than spend big dollars on a 32-year-old Williams—whose stats have been in serious decline the last few seasons—Dallas could instead opt to deal for Rose, who will be just 28 years old next season.

You could say that Rose’s production is also in decline since injuries have become a problem for him, and that would be true. But after breaking a bone under his eye in training camp last season, leaving him with blurry vision for a decent chunk of the season, Rose had trouble shooting the ball from just about anywhere on the floor for the first few months. From December 26 to the end of the season, however, Rose began to look much more like his old self -- scoring 18 points on 45.7% shooting in 41 games.

Dallas doesn’t have a ton of cap space, so it wouldn’t be able to absorb the final year of Rose’s contract without giving up something in return. They could easily deal guard Wesley Matthews, but that would likely require giving up some draft picks to get the Bulls to take on the remaining money and years on Matthews’ deal. The more likely option, if they were to trade for Rose, would be the Mavs renouncing the rights to free agents such as Zaza Pachulia, Raymond Felton, and Williams to create proper cap space to take on Rose.

<h2>2. Houston Rockets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_597797" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-597797" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Houston-Rockets-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="HOUSTON, TX - DECEMBER 25: during their game against the San Antonio Spurs at the Toyota Center on December 25, 2015 in Houston, Texas." width="757" height="532" /> Members of the Houston Rockets huddle on the court | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Rockets scored 106.5 points per game last year, the fourth most in the NBA, but that was with an offense that was heavily dependent on high-volume scorer James Harden, who averaged 29 points per game. The second leading scorer on the team was center Dwight Howard with just 13.7 points, and he might not even return to the team next season.

If Howard does in fact leave Houston, the Rockets could add Rose as their new secondary scorer without being required to give up any salary. They could, however, go ahead and send point guard Patrick Beverly and his two-years, $11.5 million left on his contract to Chicago. Beverly isn’t anything special, but he is a decent shooter from beyond the three-point line and would fit in relatively well with Jimmy Butler -- things that have never been said about Rose.

That would still leave the Rockets with some cap space to go after a mid-level free agent center, or if they’re willing to get a little crafty with their deal with the Bulls, they could talk to free agent Pau Gasol and see if he’d be interested in being included in a sign-and-trade.

<h2>3. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_588422" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588422" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Angelo-Russell-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Atlanta-Npt2zsM47AZl.jpg" alt="NBA: Some Possible Destinations for the Bulls to Trade Derrick Rose" width="757" height="510" /> Los Angeles Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell against the Atlanta Hawks. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Any kind of deal with the Lakers would likely have to happen late in the offseason, after the free agent market has dried up. The Lakers have cleared their roster to make sure they have the ability to chase high-profile names such as Kevin Durant.

Los Angeles can boast young studs such as Jordan Clarkson, D’Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and whoever they take with the second pick in the draft (either Ben Simmons or Brandon Ingram), but there’s a sense around the league that they’re going to come up empty with their wish list.

With so many teams moving toward more athletic lineups, and the fact that both Russell and Clarkson stand at 6-foot-5, a trade for Rose could make sense for the Lakers. They wouldn’t need to send anything to the Bulls other than a protected first-round draft pick, which is pretty palatable for both sides. It’s not the best case scenario for the Lakers this offseason, but if it doesn’t work out they can say goodbye to Rose after just one season.

<h2>4. Sacramento Kings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_603018" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-603018" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/George-Karl-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="OAKLAND, CA - DECEMBER 28: during the Kings' game against the Golden State Warriors at ORACLE Arena on December 28, 2015 in Oakland, California." width="757" height="466" /> Former Sacramento head coach George Karl in his natural habitat | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The Kings have star center DeMarcus Cousins and promising rookie Willie Cauley-Stein, but not a ton else going on in the way of players to build around for the future. Rajon Rondo had a fantastic bounce-back season to rebuild his value, and will likely head toward a free agent deal to play someplace else next season. That leaves the Kings with just journeyman backup point guard Darren Collison as the main man to run the offense.

The Kings could move disappointing lottery pick Ben McLemore to the Bulls in exchange for Rose, or they could move backup center Kosta Koufas and his $8 million salary next year. Either deal would probably work for the Bulls, and the Kings get a scoring point guard to go with two quality big-men, small forward Rudy Gay, shooter Marco Belinelli, Collison, and whatever player the Kings take with the eighth pick in the draft.

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James can use the 2016 NBA Playoffs to move up the list of top postseason scorers in history. Here's a look at the 5 greatest of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_790662" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-790662 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James1-e1429630777547.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

There is probably no player in the NBA more scrutinized than LeBron James. And with the 2016 NBA Playoffs underway, he is surely under the microscope once again. James has managed to conquer his playoff demons by taking home two NBA championships, but this year’s quest is a completely different animal.

He's now into his second season back home with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the expectations are sky high. While last year saw James -- one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2015-nba-playoffs-5-players-with-the-most-on-the-line.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">players we flagged as having the most on the line</a> -- prove that he could lead a group of new faces through the postseason ringer (they made it all the way to the NBA Finals, in case you forgot), the Cavaliers were dispatched by Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors.

Being the second-best team in the NBA is no minor achievement, but in the words of Ricky Bobby, "If you're not first, you're last," and that's certainly the case for LeBron.

When the Cavaliers entered the postseason, James had scored 5,020 playoff points, the sixth-highest total in NBA history. It would certainly be an impressive accomplishment If LeBron could leapfrog one of the modern icons of the sport (spoiler: he has), but James will have to work extra hard for the rest of his career if he wishes to be the top player on this list. With that in mind, here are the five all-time greatest scorers in NBA postseason history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685789" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685789" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450684012.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="518" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason points</span>: 5,172

Now in his 19th season in the NBA, Tim Duncan continues to prove that he can compete at the highest level. And Duncan should have no problem adding to his already impressive points total during the 2016 playoffs. The Big Fundamental is fortunate enough to play for a franchise that consistently makes it into the postseason (this will be his 18th trip).

Aside from being No. 5 on the list of all-time greatest postseason scorers, Duncan has the third-most rebounds in playoff history (2,811), is fourth in total games (235), fifth in made field goals (1,953), and first in total blocks (555).

He is sure to be on other postseason lists, but the only number that really matters is five: the number of NBA championships he’s won.

<em>[ 5/15/2016: As LeBron and the Cleveland Cavaliers get ready to enter the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals, James has already amassed 5,208 career postseason points. We will update this list once the postseason is finished with his current ranking.]</em>
<h2>4. Shaquille O’Neal</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason points</span>: 5,250

In his prime, Shaquille O’Neal was an unstoppable force unlike the NBA had ever seen. He was so strong and dominant that if he had position on a defender, good luck preventing the Diesel from scoring. That’s how he was able to accumulate 5,250 total points during his 17 trips to the NBA Playoffs.

In his 216 career playoff games, Shaq finished fourth in rebounds (2,508), third in field goals (2,041), and fourth in blocks (459). O’Neal was also able to capture four NBA championships and three Finals MVP awards.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Kobe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_714956" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-714956" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457220551-640x428.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="507" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason points</span>: 5,640

Most players would be more than satisfied with an NBA career that spanned 19 seasons and produced five NBA titles. But that’s what separates <a href="https://twitter.com/kobebryant" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> from the pack; he was hardly ever content. Never mind that he played in 220 postseason games, scored 5,640 points, racked up 1,119 rebounds, and made 2,014 field goals.

Now that Bryant has hung up his shoes, he has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-kobe-bryant-has-nothing-left-to-prove.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">nothing left to prove</a>. But for the Los Angeles Lakers lifer, the quest for greatness had more to do with himself than anything else. And that is why we miss him.
<h2>2. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason points</span>: 5,762

In his 20 seasons in the NBA, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played in the postseason 18 times. Not only did he achieve team success by winning six NBA championships, but he accomplished plenty from an individual standpoint. His 5,762 total points were good enough for second on the all-time list, and the No. 2 also represents the total Finals MVP awards he captured.

Jabbar’s 2,356 field goals are the most ever, his 8,851 minutes played are second all time, and he’s fifth in rebounds, with 2,481 in total. And although we are specifically covering playoff scoring, it should also be noted that this Hall of Famer is the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html" target="_blank">all-time leading scorer in NBA history</a>, with 38,387 points. But in the postseason, there can be only one top scorer.

That distinction goes to…

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Michael Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_790668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-790668 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Michael-Jordan-e1429631213450.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="603" /> Vincent LaForet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason points</span>: 5,987

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html" target="_blank">His Airness</a> dominated the competition in playoff scoring throughout his remarkable career. Although he only made 13 trips to the postseason, it helped that M.J. averaged 33.4 points per game. If you’re looking to be the best scorer in playoff history, that’s pretty much how you do it.

But if you’re looking for something even more impressive, think about the fact that Jordan won six NBA championships in six attempts, and the Chicago Bulls never played in a Game 7 in any of those Finals appearances. He also took home the Finals MVP each and every time. It’s no wonder No. 23 is considered the greatest to ever play the game.

		<description><![CDATA[The Cleveland Cavaliers need to defend home court against the Golden State Warriors, so let's get a bit bold as we break down Game 3.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_646363" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-646363" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Golden-State-Warriors-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="Warriors vs. Cavaliers: 3 Bold Predictions for Game 3" width="757" height="505" /> Golden State Warriors react on the bench during Game 5 of the 2016 Western Conference Finals. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/golden-state-warriors/" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> have hit the ground running to begin the 2016 NBA Finals, winning the first two games of their series against the Cleveland Cavaliers by a combined 48 points. As usual, Game 2 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-twitter-reactions-games-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank">was a three-point barrage</a> for the Warriors, as they knocked 15 of 33 attempts.

The Warriors' 33-point victory wasn't the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-biggest-blowouts-in-nba-playoff-history.html/" target="_blank">worst blowout in playoff history</a>, but it was pretty brutal for Cavaliers fans to watch. Now, after two tough road losses, Cleveland heads home looking to turn things around and take care of their own home-court advantage. Their backs are against the wall.

Will LeBron James and company be able to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-finals-teams-come-back-2-0-deficit.html/" target="_blank">dig their way out of this hole</a> and make this a series, or will they head back to Golden State with them down 3-1, or possibly even lose the series on their home floor? It's time to break down our three predictions for Game 3, which will be one of the most physical, heated games of the 2016 NBA playoffs.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Another Golden State victory</h2>
[caption id="attachment_650495" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-650495" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Golden-State-Warriors-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Warriors vs. Cavaliers: 3 Bold Predictions for Game 3" width="757" height="536" /> The Warriors congratulate each other during Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Warriors winning Game 3 would all but guarantee another championship for the team, which puts the Cavaliers essentially in "must win" mode. Calling a win here by the Warriors is honestly pretty tough to do, because beating a team as talented as Cleveland -- on their home floor -- makes for pretty tough business.

So, why do we predict that the Warriors to get the job done? They're clicking on too many cylinders right now. In Game 1, the Warriors had seven players score in double figures, while Klay Thompson only totaled nine points in 24 minutes.

Then, in Game 2, it switched back to their "big three" really dominating the game, but the bench scoring was spread out nicely as well. The fact is, if the Golden State stars don't step up, then their bench players will. It's tough to beat a team who's basically unstoppable across the board.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kevin Love leads the scoring for the Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644662" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644662 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KevinLoveTorontoRaptorsvClevelandCavaliersImmAPyJqvX0l.jpg" alt="Warriors vs. Cavaliers: 3 Bold Predictions for Game 3" width="757" height="473" /> Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers celebrates after scoring. | Jamie Sabau/Getty Images[/caption]

Kevin Love had five points in Game 2. Five. He was 2-of-7 shooting and pulled down just three rebounds as well. He was pretty brutal across the board, and while his Game 1 performance was better (17 points, 13 rebounds), he was still doing a lot of watching James and Kyrie Irving.

In Game 3, it will be Love's turn to step up. James is going to rely on his teammates a bit more, resulting in Love knocking down more threes and being able to do work similar to what we saw in Game 1 on the boards.

While we don't believe it'll be enough, the fact that Love steps up and the team still can't win just shows exactly how dominant the Warriors are. James <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank">won't be happy</a>, obviously, but hey, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Andre Iguodala posts a triple-double</h2>
[caption id="attachment_649633" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-649633" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/James-and-Iguodala-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Warriors vs. Cavaliers: 3 Bold Predictions for Game 3" width="757" height="505" /> Andre Iguodala strips LeBron James during Game 1 of the 2016 NBA Finals. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

In Game 1, Iggy posted a line of 12 points, seven rebounds, and six assists. Sure, that's a bit off from a triple-double, but the potential is there. In Game 2, his minutes were cut down due to the massive blowout, but he still totaled seven points, five rebounds, and three assists.

Andre Iguodala is hungry in these NBA Finals, and as we know, the biggest stage is when he really loves to take his game to the next level. With Iguodala's main role being shutting people down on the defensive end of the floor and finding open players, we think tonight is the night that he breaks out and really puts on a stellar performance.

It won't be the most amazing triple-double of all time, but he'll score around 10 points with 10-plus boards and 10 assists. Sounds a bit crazy, but we're feeling it.

While the best clubs in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank">NBA</a> continue to duke it out in the postseason, the future of the teams on the low end of the totem pole was left up to fate. By fate, of course, we mean the NBA Draft Lottery; an event where the bouncing of ping pong balls <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/two-teams-won-nba-draft-lottery.html/" target="_blank">can make or break a franchise</a>. And now that this exciting affair has taken place, all that's left to do is determine where the next crop of superstars will land.

There is still some time between now and the 2016 NBA Draft. Yet, with the official order of the picks firmly set, we feel a sense of duty to at least make an educated guess. Things <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-teams-likely-make-trade-2016-nba-draft.html/" target="_blank">will surely change</a> as we get closer to draft night, however, at this moment in time, here's a look at our post-lottery NBA mock draft.
<h2>1. Philadelphia 76ers: Ben Simmons, SF/PF, LSU</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642353" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642353" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ben-Simmons-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-640x439.jpg" alt="2016 NBA Mock Draft: Post-Lottery Edition" width="757" height="519" /> LSU's Ben Simmons brings up the ball during the SEC Tournament. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

It finally happened. After three years of genuine heartache, "The Process" worked out for the Philadelphia 76ers as they've landed the No. 1 overall pick. This is what the organization has been waiting for; the chance to select a potential franchise-altering talent. While the general consensus is that the 2016 draft features two elite players, we think the Sixers will opt for the one with the higher ceiling. And that's LSU's Ben Simmons.

Although Simmons was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-ncaas-best-player-isnt-in-march-madness.html/" target="_blank">unable to lead the Tigers</a> to the NCAA tournament and he has <a href="http://www.nbadraft.net/players/ben-simmons" target="_blank">absolutely no jump shot</a>, the point forward from Australia has something that no one else in this draft class has: once-in-a-generation talent. At 6-foot-10, 240 pounds, Simmons is a physical specimen with an NBA-ready body and a ridiculously high basketball IQ to match.

In his lone season at LSU, the First-Team All-American showed off a sensational handle and Magic-esque vision while decimating the competition to the tune of <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/ben-simmons-1.html" target="_blank">19.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 2.0 steals</a> per game. The Sixers -- and the rest of the City of Brotherly Love -- need a superstar. Simmons is their man.

<h2>2. Los Angeles Lakers: Brandon Ingram, SF, Duke</h2>
[caption id="attachment_614373" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-614373" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Brandon-Ingram-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x458.jpg" alt="2016 NBA Mock Draft: Post-Lottery Edition" width="757" height="542" /> Duke's Brandon Ingram reacts after scoring. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

The Los Angeles Lakers have the easiest decision to make in the entire 2016 draft. With two marquee players on the board, they just need to select whoever doesn't end up going No. 1. In this case, that's Duke's Brandon Ingram. But trust us, this is hardly a consolation prize.

Despite struggling early on, Ingram eventually found his groove, putting up <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/brandon-ingram-1.html" target="_blank">17.3 points per game</a> to go along with 6.8 rebounds in his lone season at Duke. On top of that, the ACC Freshman of the Year shot 44.2% from the field, knocked down 41% of his threes, and played his best ball on the biggest stage. This will only help him as he makes the transition to the National Basketball Association.

If there's a knock on Ingram, it's that he needs to get stronger and put on considerable weight (he only weighs 196 pounds). However, at 6-foot-9, he has a remarkable 7-foot-3 wingspan, and that’s something you just can’t teach. We can't imagine Ingram being anything but a special player at the next level.

<h2>3. Boston Celtics: Buddy Hield, SG, Oklahoma</h2>
[caption id="attachment_619964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-619964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Buddy-Hield-How-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="2016 NBA Mock Draft: Post-Lottery Edition" width="757" height="504" /> Oklahoma's Buddy Hield celebrates a victory over Texas A&amp;M | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

After failing to land in the top two, we could easily picture the Boston Celtics <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-teams-likely-make-trade-2016-nba-draft.html/" target="_blank">trading this pick</a>. However, since we're not including trades in this particular mock draft, we like the C's taking one of the best scorers in college basketball: Oklahoma's Buddy Hield.

Hield is an absolute superstar. There's really no other way to put it. During this past season -- his senior year -- the All-American averaged <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/buddy-hield-1.html" target="_blank">25.0 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 2.0 assists</a> per game while shooting 50.1% from the field and knocking down 45.7% of his three-point attempts. His work ethic is top notch, he has a knack for the theatrics, and he can shoot from anywhere on the floor.

While his size (6-foot-4) is hardly ideal for the shooting guard position, if there’s anyone who can overcome this disadvantage, it’s “Buddy Buckets.” Hield is a genuine competitor and an undeniable winner. The folks in Beantown will absolutely fall in love with him. We guarantee it.

<h2>4. Phoenix Suns: Dragan Bender, PF/C, Croatia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_630724" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-630724" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dragan-Bender-JACK-GUEZ-AFP-Getty-Images-640x435.jpg" alt="2016 NBA Mock Draft: Post-Lottery Edition" width="757" height="515" /> Dragan Bender during a training session for Maccabi Tel Aviv. | JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

It's safe to say that Dragan Bender is the best <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-this-17-year-old-is-the-player-to-watch-for-the-2016-nba-draft.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">NBA prospect you’ve never heard of</a>. But no matter. You will soon enough. Especially when he ends up being selected -- in our opinion -- by the Phoenix Suns with the No. 4 overall pick.

At just 18 years of age, the Croatian power forward already knows what it takes to be a pro, as he currently plays for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Bender is a <a href="http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Dragan-Bender-62877/" target="_blank">7-footer who can handle the rock</a>, run the floor, and, if he keeps improving his outside shot, has the makings of a top-tier NBA stretch four. If you like New York's Kristaps Porzingis, then you'll really like Bender. After all, he has the potential to be better.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Minnesota Timberwolves: Jamal Murray, PG/SG, Kentucky</h2>
[caption id="attachment_614397" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-614397" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jamal-Murray-Lyons-Getty-Images-640x404.jpg" alt="2016 NBA Mock Draft: Post-Lottery Edition" width="757" height="478" /> Kentucky's Jamal Murray drives to the bucket. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Kentucky guard Jamal Murray has the skills -- and the upside -- to go top three in this draft. Yet, in this mock, he'll fall to Minnesota at No. 5. Should this end up happening during the real thing, you won't hear the Timberwolves complaining.

After a slow start with the Wildcats, Murray finished his freshman season with averages of <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/jamal-murray-1.html" target="_blank">20.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 2.2 assists</a> per game. He can knock down the three, get to the basket, and is a natural scorer. And at 6-foot-5, 207 pounds, Murray has excellent size and enough strength to compete at the next level. The T-Wolves have a roster full of young talent. The addition of Murray will only make them stronger.

		<description><![CDATA[The Cavs have never won a NBA championship. Here in their second straight Finals appearance, the franchise has as good a shot as ever at winning it all.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_647565" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-647565" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KevinLoveClevelandCavaliersvTorontoRaptorsInwMTcg15Vll-640x378.jpg" alt="Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images" width="757" height="448" /> Facing a historically good Warriors team, the Cavs might actually be the favorite in the NBA Finals - Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

Almost as soon as the buzzer sounded on last summer's NBA Finals and the Golden State Warriors officially finished off the Cleveland Cavaliers, the entire basketball world expected a rematch between the two powerhouse teams to finish off this season. Now -- after the Cavs took care of the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-playoffs-teams-overcome-3-1-deficit.html/" target="_blank">the Dubs outlasted the Oklahoma City Thunder out West</a> -- that expectation has become reality.

Plenty of storylines will be floating around in the coming days prior to the start of the long-awaited battle for the 2016 championship: everything from the Warriors' quest to complete a historic season to the Cavs' search for their first-ever NBA title. With superstars all-over the court, from Stephen Curry to LeBron James t0 Kyrie Irving to Klay Thompson, the series has the ability to be an instant classic and to go the full seven games. Regardless though, we feel that their is one clear favorite in the matchup. That favorite is Cleveland.

Rest assured, this is not any kind of vicious reverse jinx. We have three key reasons why the Cavs will end their city's epic championship drought (across all major sports) and avenge their defeat from last summer.
<h2>3. Keeping up at the three-point line</h2>
The success of the Warriors over the last couple of seasons can be attributed to many things -- they play excellent defense, they capitalize on that defense with fast-break opportunities, almost every one of their players is an above-average passer for his position --  but despite Golden State's excellence in several key areas of the game, it's clear that the one thing that really allows them to be dominant is their uncanny ability to knock down three-pointers. While the Cavaliers may not be as good as the Warriors from beyond the arc, they certainly can give them a run for their money in this series.

With several solid shooters like Irving, Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, and Channing Frye, Cleveland has been lights out from three-point territory for much of the season. During the regular season, they were seventh in team three-point percentage, but the Cavs, not the Warriors, have actually <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/team/_/stat/offense-per-game/sort/threePointFieldGoalPct" target="_blank">led the playoffs in three-point shooting so far</a> -- hitting an impressive 43% with 14 makes per game from deep. With LeBron's ability to drive the ball and hit wide open guys on the perimeter, this facet to their offense has made the Cavs nearly unstoppable (well, that and the fact that they've had to go through the comparatively-easy East).

If Cleveland can continue to make deep baskets at that sort of clip, Golden State will have a hard time winning their second-straight title. The Warriors are dangerous when they have a hefty margin over their opponent from three (they had a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/matchup?gameId=400876756" target="_blank">plus-30-point advantage over OKC in their Game 7 win</a> in the Western Conference Finals), but the Cavs should be able to nullify at least some of that advantage.

<h2>2. Playoff success</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642061" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642061" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LeBron-James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="LeBron James prepares for the start of the Eastern Conference Finals. | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> LeBron James has led the Cavs on an impressive postseason run so far - Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Other than a couple of hiccups against the Raptors in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavs have saved their best basketball of the season for the playoffs. After sweeping the Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds, they handled Toronto is six games -- four of which were blowouts in favor of Cleveland. This strong play in the postseason has allowed the Cavs to find their rhythm on offense and defense, allowed the likes of Irving and Love to (finally) mesh alongside LeBron James, and, perhaps most importantly, has allowed them ample rest throughout their run. All of that should be key against a Warriors team that had to get through a dog fight in the Western Conference just to reach this point.

Golden State cruised through the first two rounds of the playoffs with relative ease -- winning in five games over both the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers -- but the battle with the Thunder in the conference finals required a full-fledged effort from their entire roster. Aside from the series going the full seven games, the Warriors needed to be at their best in order to overcome a 3-1 deficit -- and, to their credit, they were at their best in those final three games. Heading into the Finals, the wear and tear of that series could come into play against a Cavs team that has been simply preparing for this series all along. The Cavs are playing as well as they ever have in the second LeBron-era, but with an added rest advantage, they might just cruise to the title.

<h2>1. A healthy roster</h2>
[caption id="attachment_534542" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-534542 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/kyrie-irving-cleveland-cavs-e1431432896575.jpg" alt="kyrie-irving-cleveland-cavs-e1431432896575.jpg" width="757" height="500" /> A healthy Kyrie Irving could make all the difference for Cleveand in the Finals - Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

Above all else, the reason to like the Cavs' chances in this series is the fact that they are healthy -- something they couldn't say in last season's series. Kyrie Irving missed all but one of the games during the Finals due to injury. Kevin Love missed all but the first-round of the playoffs a year ago. Now, the other two-thirds of Cleveland's big three is healthy and playing well -- Irving is averaging 24 points per game during the playoffs; Love is averaging 17. The Cavs also have others in their supporting cast that are contributing to their championship cause, making their situation more desirable than it was last summer.

This isn't to say that the Warriors aren't healthy. Everyone of their key players is active heading into the series, which could make this series one of the best we've seen in years. However, seeing as the Cavs played decently well in the Finals last season (when LeBron James essentially carried them to two wins), a healthy roster should lead to even better results this time around. The series should be a classic that goes at least six games, but given what we've seen this postseason, it's certainly not a stretch to consider the Cavs as the favorite.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_628351" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628351 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Draymond-Green-and-Steve-Kerr-of-the-Golden-State-Warriors.jpg" alt="NBA: The 3 Players With the Most Technical Fouls This Season" width="757" height="500" /> Draymond Green (L) and head coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors argue a call with referee Tony Brothers in the second quarter against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game Three of the Western Conference Finals during the 2016 NBA Playoffs. | J Pat Carter/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> averted a potential disaster <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-reasons-warriors-will-beat-thunder.html/" target="_blank">heading into Game Four</a> of the Western Conference Finals, as the NBA decided <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15687018/2016-nba-playoffs-golden-state-warriors-draymond-green-fined-not-suspended-kick-groin-oklahoma-city-thunder-steven-adams" target="_blank">not to suspend Draymond Green</a> concerning his "kick heard 'round the world." Everybody seems to have a different opinion on whether or not the strike was intentional and whether or not the feisty player should have been required to sit out a contest.

The fact of the matter -- no matter how questionable Green's reputation may be concerning some of his on-court actions being called borderline dirty -- is that the Dubs will have his services for their games in the future. Although the former Michigan State Spartan escaped punishment this time, he must know that he is on thin ice. It remains to be seen how Golden State would respond without one of their emotional leaders, but they have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-why-the-warriors-shouldnt-rush-back-stephen-curry.html/" target="_blank">faced plenty of adversity</a> before.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-playoffs-5-keys-okcs-win-game-3-wcf.html/" target="_blank">Game Three</a> kick to Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven Adams' groin will cost Green $25,000 (which is basically nothing based on his income), and the call was upgraded to a flagrant two, meaning that the forward now has three "flagrant points" during the postseason.

One more point would result in an automatic one-game suspension. Although flagrants are different than technicals, we have decided to look at the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/fouls/sort/technicalFouls/seasontype/2" target="_blank">league leaders in "Ts"</a> from this past regular season. As you will see, Green is no stranger to this type of controversy.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628351" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628351 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DraymondGreenKlayThompsonGoldenStateJ3zU79NfeYil.jpg" alt="NBA: The 3 Players With the Most Technical Fouls This Season" width="757" height="500" /> Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Number of technical fouls</span>: 13

Always known as a high-energy, extremely fiery player on the floor, Green finished with the third-most technical fouls in the league this season at 13. No. 23 played in 81 of the 82 Warriors' games this season, so he averaged a technical foul about every six games. He also finished with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/fouls/sort/fouls/seasontype/2" target="_blank">seventh-most personal fouls</a> at 240, which was more than either of the top-two T-ed up guys on this countdown.

Somewhat surprisingly though, Green only finished the regular season with one flagrant foul and was not ejected from any games. We'll see if he can be on his best behavior for the remainder of the playoffs.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Isaiah Thomas, Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_631087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-631087 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IsaiahThomasAtlantaHawksvBostonCelticsAiP6JAjXPpDl-1.jpg" alt="NBA: The 3 Players With the Most Technical Fouls This Season" width="757" height="500" /> Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Number of technical fouls</span>: 14

The Boston Celtics' <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thomais02.html" target="_blank">Isaiah Thomas</a> took massive strides in becoming an upper-tier point guard in the Eastern Conference this season. Without him, we don't see the Cs making the playoffs as a five-seed and possibly not making it at all. With that being said, the pint-sized scoring machine sure knew how to get overemotional on the hardwood this season.

Thomas finished with the second-most technical fouls in the league at 14. Given No. 4's ability to quickly drive to the basket, he was frequently drawing hard contact on his shot attempts. The hard contact led to tons of foul calls, as well as plenty of missed calls, which likely led to many verbal outbursts from Thomas directed at the men in stripes. That is something you just can't get away with.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. DeMarcus Cousins, Sacramento Kings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_616040" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-616040" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/DeMarcus-Cousins-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images1-1024x701-640x438.jpg" alt="NBA: The 3 Players With the Most Technical Fouls This Season" width="757" height="518" /> DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento Kings | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Number of technical fouls</span>: 17

Sacramento Kings center <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/couside01.html" target="_blank">DeMarcus Cousins</a> paced the association in Ts yet again this past season. Despite playing in just 65 games this season, he set the mark with 17 technicals, putting him at an approximate average of one every four games. Cousins also had one ejection on his resume for the campaign.

The technical foul leaderboard is a place No. 15 has frequently called home throughout his NBA career. He <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/fouls/sort/technicalFouls/year/2013/seasontype/2" target="_blank">led the league</a> with 17 in 2012–13; led again in 2013–14 with 16; and calmed down a bit with "just" 14 last season (good for third). Cousins has a boatload of talent, but his well-known temper seems like it will always hold him back from being one of the most coveted players in the league.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_645112" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-645112" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/StephenCurryGoldenStateWarriorsvOklahoma4kwHB1-CQgAl-640x378.jpg" alt="NBA Playoffs: 9 Teams That Have Overcome the 3-1 Deficit" width="757" height="448" /> Stephen Curry and the Warriors now have to accomplish a rare feat: keeping their season alive following their Game 4 loss in the Western Confernce Finals. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/golden-state-warriors/" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> were on the brink. After losing Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder, a team that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-5-greatest-nba-teams-never-to-win-a-championship.html/" target="_blank">was at times unbeatable</a> in 2016 now faces a 3-2 (up from 3-1) deficit in the series. Now, the team that has done historical things all season long needs to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-reasons-warriors-will-beat-thunder.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">accomplish another rare feat</a>, as not many teams in the history of the NBA playoffs have overcome such a hole in a best-of-seven series.

More than 200 teams have faced the 3-1 deficit in a seven-game set. Only nine of those teams beat the odds and won the series in seven games. So, while not impossible, it's clear that the Warriors' order is a tall one -- especially with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-playoffs-5-keys-okcs-win-game-3-wcf.html/" target="_blank">how well the Thunder are playing</a>. Let's look back at the nine teams that completed the comeback -- organized from oldest to most recent -- as Golden State hopes to join the exclusive club and keep their hopes of a second-straight NBA title alive.
<h2>Boston Celtics over Philadelphia 76ers, 1968</h2>
During the '60s, the Boston Celtics were accustomed to competing for NBA championships, as the franchise <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/" target="_blank">won an unprecedented nine titles</a> during the decade. With the legendary Bill Russell at the coaching helm in 1968, it didn't appear that the Celtics would add to that total when they were down 3-1 to the Philadelphia 76ers in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1968-nba-eastern-division-finals-celtics-vs-76ers.html" target="_blank">Eastern Conference Finals</a>.

This Phillies team included the likes of Hal Greer and Wilt Chamberlain. However, Russell (who not only coached, but also played back then), John Havlicek, and company rolled in Game 5 before outlasting the 76ers in Games 6 and 7 -- the latter game occurred in Philadelphia -- to become the first team to overcome the 3-1 deficit. Of course, Boston went on to win yet another title that season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Los Angeles Lakers over Phoenix Suns, 1970</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595266" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595266" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wilt-Chamberlain-Brian-Bahr-Allsport-Getty-Images-640x432.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Wil Chamberlain | Brian Bahr/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

In NBA history, not many teams were as loaded as the Los Angeles Lakers of 1970. With three NBA legends on hand (Jerry West, Chamberlain, and Elgin Baylor), they were incredibly difficult to deal with. The Phoenix Suns though, with the likes of Paul Silas and Connie Hawkins, had the Lakers on the ropes in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1970-nba-western-division-semifinals-suns-vs-lakers.html" target="_blank">first round of the NBA playoffs</a> that season, winning three of the first four games of their series.

However, that 3-1 deficit only seemed to make LA more dangerous, as great performances by West and Chamberlain led the Lakers to three straight routs and a series win in seven games. Unfortunately, LA fell short in the Finals that season.
<h2>Washington Bullets over San Antonio Spurs, 1979</h2>
Coming off an NBA championship the previous season, the Washington Bullets hoped to repeat in 1979. Facing a San Antonio Spurs team that featured the likes of George Gervin in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1979-nba-eastern-conference-finals-spurs-vs-bullets.html" target="_blank">Eastern Conference Finals</a> though, the Bullets fell into a 3-1 deficit that seemed too difficult to come back from.

Led by the likes of Bob Dandridge and Elvin Hayes, Washington did just that -- although all three of the games they won consecutively were absolutely dog fights. The Bullets squeaked out wins by four, eight, and two points, respectively, in the final three games to knock out the Spurs and advance to the Finals once again -- where they lost to the Seattle Supersonics.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Boston Celtics over Philadelphia 76ers, 1981</h2>
Just like in 1968, the Celtics and 76ers battled for a trip to the NBA Finals in an <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1981-nba-eastern-conference-finals-76ers-vs-celtics.html" target="_blank">Eastern Conference Finals bout in 1981</a>. Also like '68, Philadelphia managed to compete to a 3-1 series lead -- this time led by Julius Erving and company.

Yet again, though, they couldn't close out Boston with three chances to advance. Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, and the Celtics pulled off the comeback, winning the final three games by a total of five points. It was a tightly contested series, but the Celtics proved superior once again. They also won another NBA title that season.
<h2>Houston Rockets over Phoenix Suns, 1995</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HakeemOlajuwonMiamiHeatvHoustonRocketsCYejhZAEPcWl.jpg" alt="NBA Playoffs: 9 Teams That Have Overcome the 3-1 Deficit" width="757" height="473" /> Houston Rockets' legend Hakeem Olajuwon | Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]

The '90s were mostly dominated by Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, but the Houston Rockets also managed their most successful stretch in franchise history during this decade, winning back-to-back NBA titles in 1994 and 1995. During the '95 run, the Phoenix Suns had the defending champs on the ropes in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1995-nba-western-conference-semifinals-rockets-vs-suns.html" target="_blank">Western Conference Semifinals</a>.

Behind Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson, Phoenix seemed to be in position to move on to the conference finals after taking a 3-1 series lead with a win in Game 4. With clutch plays by Hakeem Olajuwon and great play by the likes of Clyde Drexler, the Rockets stormed back in the final three games to take the series -- fueling a run to their second-straight title.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Miami Heat over New York Knicks, 1997</h2>
A series known for its physical play, which resulted in several altercations between the two teams, the Miami Heat and New York Knicks put on a show in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1997-nba-eastern-conference-semifinals-knicks-vs-heat.html" target="_blank">1997 Eastern Conference Semifinals</a>. Led by Patrick Ewing, the Knicks got out to a 3-1 lead, but things were only getting started at that point.

Miami won Game 5, but it's really only remembered for one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQFG4vRgeKo" target="_blank">more memorable fights</a> in league history. Behind Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning, the Heat completed the comeback to advance to the conference finals, where they were upended by the eventual champion Chicago Bulls.
<h2>Detroit Pistons over Orlando Magic, 2003</h2>
[caption id="attachment_645128" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-645128" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ChaunceyBillupsOrlandoMagicvDetroitPistons6z9mniFExMsl.jpg" alt="NBA Playoffs: 9 Teams That Have Overcome the 3-1 Deficit" width="757" height="570" /> Former Detroit Pistons' great Chauncey Billups. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The Detroit Pistons were one of the better teams during the early 2000s, as they made six consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearances at one point. The start of the streak came in 2003, but facing the upset-minded Orlando Magic in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2003-nba-eastern-conference-first-round-magic-vs-pistons.html" target="_blank">first round that season</a>, the Pistons were in serious trouble.

Tracy McGrady had the Magic rolling with a 3-1 series lead following a Game 4 win. Chauncey Billups and the Pistons figured things out quickly though, winning the final three games by double-digit margins to avoid the upset. The New Jersey Nets eventually swept them in the conference finals that season, but Orlando went on to win a championship the very next season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Phoenix Suns over Los Angeles Lakers, 2006</h2>
With the duo of Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Phoenix Suns used to be one of the most entertaining teams to watch in the entire NBA. That entertainment value never led to an NBA title, but it did lead the Suns on several long playoff runs. One of those runs occurred in 2006, when they overcame a 3-1 deficit against Kobe Bryant and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2006-nba-western-conference-first-round-lakers-vs-suns.html" target="_blank">the Lakers in the first round</a>.

After Bryant hit a game-winner in Game 4 to give the Lakers a chokehold on the series, Phoenix used dominant efforts in Games 5 and 7 and an overtime victory in Game 6 to advance. They eventually lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the conference finals.
<h2>Houston Rockets over Los Angeles Clipper, 2015</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574001" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574001" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/James-Harden-Golden-State-Warriors-v-Houston-EeyVIhzdRzpl.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images " width="757" height="478" /> James Harden of the Houston Rockets - Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The most recent 3-1 comeback is also one of the most memorable ones. In last season's <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-western-conference-semifinals-clippers-vs-rockets.html" target="_blank">Western Conference Semifinals</a>, the Houston Rockets seemingly had no hope against the Los Angeles Clippers, as they faced a 3-1 deficit following back-to-back blowouts in Games 3 and 4. A nice effort by James Harden got the team going again at home in Game 5, but after falling behind big in Game 6 entering the fourth quarter, the Rockets' season appeared to be over.

However, a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201505140LAC.html" target="_blank">40-15 final period in that game</a> allowed Houston to earn one of the more stunning victories in playoff history and led them to a dominant performance at home in Game 7. They lost to the Warriors in the conference finals, but it was still one of the best comebacks in NBA history for the Rockets last season.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_625653" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-625653" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Isaiah-Thomas-Boston-Celtics_Khris-Middleton-Milwaukee-Bucks.jpg" alt="NBA: 4 Players the Boston Celtics Could Target in a Trade" width="757" height="505" /> Isaiah Thomas (R) of the Boston Celtics drives against Khris Middleton (L) of the Milwaukee Bucks. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

The Boston Celtics’ season ended in a disappointing way, with the team winning only two games in their first-round matchup with the Atlanta Hawks. But for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/boston-celtics/" target="_blank">young Boston team</a>, winning 48 games this season and getting into a four-way tie for the third-best record in the Eastern Conference made this season a massive success.

So, while the world begins to focus on <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-nba-players-who-could-opt-to-become-free-agents.html/" target="_blank">an extremely interesting crop of free agents</a> with the salary cap exploding upward this summer, let’s look at four available trades the Boston Celtics could make to improve their roster and create a brighter future for the franchise.
<h2>1. Danilo Gallinari</h2>
<span class="message_body">The Denver Nuggets should look to make some of their older and more expensive players available in trades this summer so they can focus on getting younger players, while freeing up cap space for those who fit with where this team is headed.
</span>

Gallinari might be a strong fit in just about any offense, with his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-players-who-shoot-the-most-free-throws.html/" target="_blank">shooting and scoring abilities</a>, height, and long arms, but he will be 28 years old this summer, and it’s possible that he will opt out of his contract in order to earn more money in free agency after next season.

The Boston Celtics have plenty of draft picks -- three in the first round and five in the second round in 2016, <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/detailed" target="_blank">according to RealGM</a> -- and could make a deal for Gallinari without disrupting much on their roster. It would involve a middle-of-the-first-round pick and maybe a few second-round picks, plus some possible salary fillers if necessary. But the Celtics will have plenty of cap space, so making this deal without giving up any salary shouldn’t be an issue.
<h2>2. Jimmy Butler</h2>
The Bulls were awful this year, and it’s fairly evident that they need to make massive changes on their roster to build something for the future. That said, there’s no indication that they need to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-could-jimmy-butlers-days-with-bulls-be-numbered.html/" target="_blank">trade Jimmy Butler</a> -- they would likely rather move Derrick Rose. But for the right deal the Bulls would have to consider a trade, and if there’s any team that could offer such a package, it would be the Boston Celtics.

The Celtics could send Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk, and two of their first-round picks for Butler (one would need to be the Nets pick). Butler gives Boston a true star at the shooting guard position and, as a fairly big bonus, one who was signed to a long-term deal prior to the salary cap going up. Butler will only make $16.4 million in 2016–17 and with this deal the Celtics would only add about $6 million in salary -- leaving them with plenty to spend on a big free agent like Dwight Howard.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Zach Randolph</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578182" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578182" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/randolph.jpg" alt="NBA: 4 Players the Boston Celtics Could Target in a Trade" width="757" height="474" /> The Memphis Grizzlies' Zach Randolph points to his teammate after making a basket against the Los Angeles Lakers. | AP Photo/Jae C. Hong[/caption]

The Memphis Grizzlies fizzled out in the second-half of the season this year, mostly due to injuries. But with the way the Western Conference is trending and the age of the Grizzlies' core players, it might be time for them to start adjusting their roster to stay viable for the next few years. One such move might be dealing power forward Zach Randolph, who is on the final year of his contract and making just over $10 million.

The Boston Celtics might be able to make this deal by giving up their own first-round pick and possibly some dead weight in salary, such as Jonas Jerebko’s $5 million, which he’s owed next season. It helps improve Boston’s front line, which is fairly weak and could lose Jared Sullinger in free agency.

This would simply have to be  one small move in a series of other moves this offseason, as the 35-year-old Randolph does little to move the needle on his own. But he’s a veteran with playoff experience in the tough Western Conference, so landing him could be a wise move.
<h2>4. Serge Ibaka</h2>
The Oklahoma City Thunder have officially advanced to the Western Conference Finals, so talking about blowing up their roster seems insane at the moment. But with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-3-teams-kevin-durant-could-play-for-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">Kevin Durant at risk to leave</a> this summer and Ibaka only having one season remaining on his contract, the Thunder might look to move him and get some young assets in return.

With several draft picks and a young roster, the Boston Celtics would be an obvious fit for Ibaka. Boston, as previously discussed, has a weak front line and could really use a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-5-x-factors-for-the-2016-playoffs.html/" target="_blank">player of Ibaka’s caliber</a> at the power forward position. Again, dumping Jerebko or even Amir Johnson’s $12 million salary could be possible if the Celtics are willing to give up a draft pick high enough for Oklahoma City to justify the move.

Of course, the Thunder would risk losing Ibaka in free agency after the 2016–17 season, but it might be a risk that the team is willing to take if they can make other moves to build up a true contender in the Eastern Conference.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_833683" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-833683" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tim-Duncan-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x458.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="541" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

For every Justise Winslow and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-is-dangelo-russell-a-future-superstar.html/" target="_blank">D’Angelo Russell</a>, there’s a Paul Pierce and a Manu Ginobili.

The National Basketball Association is filled with scores of young talent and to be quite frank, that’s what puts the fans in the arena these days. The high-flying dunks and the ankle-breaking crossovers by the league’s twenty-somethings are what usually make the nightly SportsCenter Top 10.

With that being said, the dedication and passion that the NBA’s oldest players show each and every year they return to the hardwood is admirable. The Kevin Willis’, Robert Parish’s and Juwan Howard’s – players who played past the age of 40 – is something rare. Heck, even Michael Jordan (after his numerous retirements), played until he was 40.

The five oldest players in basketball represent a diverse group. Two, maybe three of them are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nba-hall-of-famers-still-playing-today.html/3/" target="_blank">locks for enshrinement</a> into the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA. One of men – the oldest of them all – has had a deceivingly very solid career. The last of the bunch, well he’ll always have his legendary appearance or two on the popular “Shaqtin’ a Fool" clip show.

Here’s a look at the five oldest active players in the NBA in descending order starting with the “youngest."

<h2>5. Pablo Prigioni</h2>
[caption id="attachment_845921" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-845921 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Pablo-Prigioni-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="during Game Seven of the Western Conference Semifinals at the Toyota Center for the 2015 NBA Playoffs on May 17, 2015 in Houston, Texas.

Yep, Pablo Prigioni was the player alluded to that has absolutely no shot at basketball immortality in Massachusetts. However, the Argentinian has actually molded himself a nice little NBA career here in America.

After a highly successful tenure in the the Spanish and Argentine leagues, the point guard joined the New York Knicks in 2012. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201211020NYK.html" target="_blank">On Nov. 2 of that year</a>, Prigioni became the oldest rookie in league history when he came off the bench for 16 minutes and contributed three assists and a rebound in the season-opening win. After two-and-a-half seasons off the New York pine (he also started 48 games), he was traded to the Houston Rockets in February. Prigioni actually played in 17 games during the Rockets playoff run, averaging 3.1 points per game in just over 17 minutes per contest.

He was traded to the Denver Nuggets in July and subsequently released. On Aug. 3, Prigioni <a href="http://www.nba.com/clippers/clippers-sign-pablo-prigioni" target="_blank">signed a one-year deal</a> with the Los Angeles Clippers. No matter how much longer his NBA career lasts, Prigioni will always have his 2012 debut to look back on and smile.

<h2>4. Vince Carter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_678893" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-678893" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Vince-Carter-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

“Vinsanity." “V.C." “Air Canada." Whatever nickname you choose to call <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cartevi01.html" target="_blank">Vince Carter</a> by, all of them seem to fit him just fine.

Carter, who is just 111 days older than Prigioni, burst on the scene after being drafted by the Golden State Warriors as the fifth overall pick of the 1998 NBA Draft. Unfortunately for the Warriors, they had agreed to trade Carter in 1993 (as a future first round draft pick) to the Orlando Magic so they would not get to see V.C. in their uniform. The future star was again traded twice in 1994 and ironically ended up back with the Warriors on draft day. After being selected though, the Warriors traded Carter and cash to the Toronto Raptors for Antawn Jamison in what ended up being somewhat of a boneheaded move.

Across six NBA teams averaging 18.9 points per game, Carter has established himself as a worthy candidate for the Hall of Fame. While he’s now in the twilight of his career with the Memphis Grizzlies, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-dunkers-in-nba-history.html/4/" target="_blank">one of the best dunkers</a> of all-time is still capable of rim-rattling throw downs and mega-clutch game-winners now and then.

<h2>3. Kevin Garnett</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761114" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761114" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Kevin-Garnett-640x417.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="493" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Age: 39

</em>

Whether you love him or hate him, it’s impossible to ignore what Kevin Garnett has accomplished as one of the greatest NBA power forwards of all-time.

The future first-ballot Hall-of-Famer may be regarded as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-dirtiest-players-in-nba-history.html/" target="_blank">one of the dirtiest players in the league</a>. He has frequently been called out for his over-the-top trash talk. He’s probably one of the most difficult players in the entire sport to have as a teammate. Let’s focus on the positives though.

KG’s bookend career began (and will almost certainly end) with the franchise that took him fifth overall in 1995, the Minnesota Timberwolves. He brought a struggling, newly born organization in Minnesota into perennial contention in the Western Conference during his first dozen seasons there. Then he shipped it up to Boston and was a monumental piece of a championship team in his first year there and contending squads thereafter. After a brief, decidedly unfulfilling stay with the Brooklyn Nets, Garnett is back where it all began, trying to do it all over again.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Tim Duncan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685789" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685789" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/450684012.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="518" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Age: 40
Years of NBA experience: 18
Years left on current contract: 1
</em>

For as much as their NBA statistics and skill sets may mirror each other, Garnett and Tim Duncan‘s personalities could not be more different.

The career-long San Antonio Spurs power forward has been widely regarded as one of the most respectable, decent guys in the league for years. You really can’t say enough positive things about Duncan’s long career and on top of that, he’s been among the most successful players of all-time as well.

He has averaged a near double-double for his career and with 15 All-Star appearances and five championship rings (and counting), Duncan may be the most worthy <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-best-nba-rookies-in-the-modern-era.html/2/" target="_blank">number-one overall draft pick</a> of all-time.

<h2>1. Andre Miller</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761721" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761721" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/andre-miller-640x432.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="511" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Age: 40
Years of experience: 16
Years left on current contract: 1</em>

For all of the talk about the Timberwolves’ young and promising talent, they sure do like bringing in the geriatrics, too. In 2015 alone, the Wolves have acquired two of the three oldest players in the league.

Nearing the midway point of his 40th year on Earth, Andre Miller agreed to a one-year deal with Minnesota last summer, making this his eighth team. Miller, now playing for the San Antonio Spurs beats out his most-famous teammate (Tim Duncan) by a mere 37 days to earn the “oldest player" title and while their career stats are obviously not comparable, the guard has put up very good numbers.

He has played in an absurd 1299 games (936 starts) across 16 seasons, which averages out to an extremely durable 81 games per season. He has never made an All-Star team, but he did lead the league in assists per game at 10.9 way back during the 2001-2002 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. His career averages of 12.5 points per game and 6.5 assists per contest are solid and has snagged 3.7 rebounds per game, which is very good for a point guard. He is also the all-time assist leader for active players with 8,505, a total that puts him ninth among all players in league history.

		<description><![CDATA[With the NBA Playoffs slowly but surely coming down to the final two teams, we take a look at which players wound up playing the most games in the postseason.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_635020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Shaq-Kobe-Lucy-Nicholson-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="During the Lakers glory days, 2002." width="757" height="541" /> Shaquille O'Neal laughs with Kobe Bryant in the fourth quarter during the Lakers' 86-73 win against the Chicago Bulls, in Los Angeles, CA, 22 November 2002 | Lucy Nicholson/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Longevity in the NBA postseason is something of an art and a benefit of timing and placement — it skews heavily towards modern players, since they play more games in a series than their predecessors, and it helps guys who are on teams that make deep runs in the playoffs — but when you get to the very top of the list, you’re looking at players who have developed a knack for not being sent home early. All of these guys are players you’d recognize, and most of them have the careers that will safely place them in the Naismith Hall of Fame once they retire. The active ones, that is — some of these guys are already safely enshrined in Springfield.

Regardless, all of these names are sure to dredge up memories of playoffs past, for better or for worse. These NBA fixtures have a combined forty-five championship rings, innumerable All-Star appearances, and enough sold jerseys to cover a stadium floor. They are, broadly speaking, some of the first choices for any respectable best of any era squad from the league’s history.

And some of them are still playing in the league. In fact, some of them are guaranteed to tack on a couple extra games before this postseasons is over. So, without further ado, here are the ten players who have logged the most playoff games in the NBA.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10, 9 and 8. Karl Malone, Manu Ginobili &amp; Danny Ainge — 193 games</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Manu-Ginobili-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="548" /> Manu Ginobili #20 of the San Antonio Spurs celebrates with the Larry O'Brien trophy after defeating the Miami Heat. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

We have a proposal. We would like the NBA and basketball fans to take it seriously. The world needs a <em>Twins</em> remake with Karl Malone and Danny Ainge. Everyone would love it. Anyway, this is another case of fuzzy numbers, because while Malone played before the seven game opening round, Ainge’s career stretched from 1981 all the way until 1995, when he retired after playing with the Boston Celtics, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Phoenix Suns (in that order). He made the Finals with both Boston and Phoenix, and won a pair of rings with the Celtics.

Karl Malone spent his entire meaningful career with the Utah Jazz. Are we giving him an out for his ring chasing with the Lakers in 2004? Absolutely — by that time the Mailman was 40 years old, had racked up the second-most points scored in NBA history, held the record for most free throws attempted (over 13,000) and made (over 9,700), and had spent seventeen seasons running that same pick and roll with John Stockton in Utah. Plus, his well-documented disdain for anything flashy made his brief tenure in LA all the funnier. And, at the end of the day, his ring chasing didn’t work, so all is right with the world.

As for Manu, he'll claim the eight spot all for himself if he can see the floor in one more NBA playoff game, and with the Spurs-Thunder series set to go to at least five games, it's entirely likely that he'll get that by the end of the week.

<h2>7. Scottie Pippen –  208 games</h2>
While Scottie Pippen may be considered Jordan’s also-ran for the majority of NBA fans, those in the know are aware of just how good Pippen was: an all time all defense first team member, and not just one of the guys who was lucky enough to play with Michael, à la Steve Kerr. Pippen would lead a series of increasingly dysfunctional teams to the postseason, famously pushing the Los Angeles Lakers to 7 games back in 2000. That 2000 Lakers-Blazers series that features the next player on our list, and luckily for us, some of the games are on YouTube. Check it out:

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WhKcBBRLac8"></iframe>
<h2>6. Shaq — 216 games</h2>
And then consider the fact that Shaq, in his runs with the Lakers, the Magic, and the Heat, is directly responsible for keeping guys like Scottie Pippen as low on the list as they are. The 2001 Lakers may be the most dominant NBA team to win a championship in the last decade and change — something to be said for a time that covered the Tim Duncan Spurs, the Kevin Garnett Celtics, and the Jason Kidd Nets (that’s a joke). Shaq remains the single most physically intimidating player of the NBA’s modern age, and if Wilt was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FreeDarko-Presents-Undisputed-Basketball-History/dp/1608190838/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400857371&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+undisputed+guide+to+pro+basketball+history" target="_blank">the NBA’s nuclear option</a>, then the Big Artistotle was the rest of the armory. He finished with four rings, three in LA and one in Miami.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Kobe Bryant — 220 games</h2>
[caption id="attachment_626065" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-626065" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kobe-Bryant_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant during a game in 2014.Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="507" /> Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant during a game in 2014. |Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Since Kobe’s public persona has been built around his comparisons, successful or otherwise, to other NBA players from LeBron to any of the Lakers greats, it’s got to be gratifying to Kobe, the public figure, that he logged over fifty more playoff games than Michael Jordan. However, tying His Airness in total rings would prove to be elusive asthe Lakers sank into the depths of the Western Conference for Bryant's last seasons in the league.

While Kobe may never have been the best player on any of his championship teams (there’s a case to be made for Pau Gasol, and if you think Bryant was anything other than second fiddle to Shaq, you’re suffering from selective memory), he has been a fixture in the post-season for almost his entire career. While he was never be the same Kobe he was before his Achilles’ tear (and never made it back to the playoffs), Bryant's legacy among the game's greats is secured.
<h2>4. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar — 237 games</h2>
Kareem, formerly Lew Alcindor, is the most prolific scorer in NBA history, and was a fixture in the league from the moment he entered it until the moment he left. He has the distinction of being, at worst, the second best player on one of the premiere franchises (depending on how you feel about Magic), and over twenty years of playoff appearances (from 1969 until 1989), Kareem was contributing to wins and championships even after the age of 40.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/16iI621CR8k"></iframe>
<h2>3. Robert Horry — 244 games</h2>
But Kareem might be less tied to the playoffs than Big Shot Rob. Horry was, by all accounts, a relatively middling NBA player, which puts him somewhere around the 99th percentile for basketball players around the globe, who’s one defining skill was his ability to hit important shots. All of them. He hit all of the important shots, possibly ever. Horry played for four teams over sixteen seasons, winning rings with Houston, Los Angeles, and San Antonio (he played a half-season in Phoenix between H-town and LA). He was utterly unafraid of the moment and was never all that high on the other team’s scouting report. Go watch that video above if you need a refresher on why Robert Horry was just OK for the first 43 minutes of the game and scarier than anyone else in the last five.

<h2>2. Tim Duncan — 247 games</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Spurs-Champs-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="at the AT&amp;T Center on June 15, 2014 in San Antonio, Texas." width="757" height="525" /> Tony Parker,Tim Duncan, and Manu Ginobili celebrate after defeating the Miami Heat in Game Five of the 2014 NBA Finals | Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The Big Fundamental has more 50-win seasons than many NBA franchises — that’s the kind of thing you associate with a guy who’s this far up on the playoff game list and has four championship rings to his credit. Duncan is the model superstar, as far as the organizations around the league are concerned, and with the Spurs running rampant over the Oklahoma City Thunder (and the Western Conference) so far, it’s conceivable that Duncan might move up at least one more spot by the time he retires.
<h2>1. Derek Fisher — 259 games</h2>
Last but not least, we’ve got Derek Fisher — the guy who went out of his way to only play for good teams and bails on teams he doesn’t think are going to make it very far once the regular season starts (go google ‘Derek Fisher Utah’ and ‘Derek Fisher Dallas’, we’ll wait) — has played in more playoff games than anyone else, ever, in the history of the NBA. At the age of 39, Fisher seemed to have spent the last few years chasing this record at the expense of anything else, other than maybe angling for the coaching gig the New York Knicks were waiting to offer him (spoiler alert: it didn't end well). Fisher last saw postseason action with the Oklahoma City Thunder.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_631846" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-631846" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KevinDurantKawhiLeonardOklahomaCityThunderVag_FyjHrjCl-640x400.jpg" alt="Thunder vs. Spurs: Playoff Preview and Prediction" width="757" height="473" /> San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard and Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The story of the Western Conference this season -- and the NBA for that matter -- has been the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-the-warriors-arent-the-best-team-in-nba-history-yet.html/" target="_blank">historic run of the defending champion Golden State Warriors</a>. With a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-playoffs-the-sad-state-of-the-western-conference.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">recent wave of key injuries</a> that has ravaged both the Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers, though, the focus of the conference's remaining playoff slate shifts to the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder.

The championship window for both of those teams has been opened much wider with injuries to their conference rivals. Luckily for us, the two are set to meet in a conference semifinal series loaded with intrigue. Over recent seasons, the Thunder and Spurs have become more than familiar with one another in the postseason, as they have met twice in the conference finals since 2012 (with each side winning once).

This season, while they won't play for a direct trip to the NBA Finals, the winner of this second-round tilt might have the edge in the Western Conference Finals thanks to injuries to the other contenders out West. Therefore, to say this series will be intense and competitive is an understatement. With a tight battle expected, is it the more experienced Spurs or the more explosive Thunder that hold the advantage? To answer, we break down reasons to like each side and predicted a winner.

<h2>The case for the Thunder</h2>
[caption id="attachment_528504" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-528504 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin-Durant-and-Russell-Westbrook-e1429526700499.jpg" alt="Thunder vs. Spurs: Playoff Preview and Prediction" width="757" height="515" /> Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. When Oklahoma City's dynamic duo is clicking, they provide the most lethal tandem in the league, giving the Thunder a strong chance to beat anybody. In four matchups against a Spurs team that lost just 15 games this season, that duo led the team to two victories.

Durant and Westbrook combined for 55 and 60 points, respectively, in those wins, which both came on the Thunder's home floor. When they traveled to San Antonio, the duo didn't play in one game -- because it <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400829102" target="_blank">didn't hold any meaning</a> -- and they were held to just 47 combined points in the other. That proves that if OKC is to win this series, their stars will have to be as brilliant as they usually are.

Another key for the Thunder will be their work on the glass. They out-rebounded the Spurs in every meeting and will need to do so in this series if they want to control the pace of the games. That means guys like Enes Kanter, Steven Adams, and even Durant and Westbrook will have to come up big on the boards. Their rebounding ability gave them an edge during the regular season and could cause a lot of trouble for the Spurs over the course of a long series.

If the Thunder rebound and get max production out of Durant and Westbrook, they'll be a real challenge to knock out of the playoffs. Of course, the defensive-minded Spurs will make their ability to achieve those things quite difficult.

<h2>The case for the Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_588599" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588599" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LaMarcus-Aldridge-Chris-Covatta-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="Thunder vs. Spurs: Playoff Preview and Prediction" width="757" height="501" /> LaMarcus Aldridge of the San Antonio Spurs | Chris Covatta/Getty Images[/caption]

When San Antonio experiences success (which is a majority of the time), they play great defense, shoot well from downtown, and get All-Star production out of Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge. Their defense was ranked first in points allowed, they shot the second highest three-point field goal percentage as a team, and Leonard and Aldridge were great all season long -- a big reason why the Spurs won 67 regular-season games.

Against the Thunder, though, things didn't always go so well. A team that gave up around 91 points per game on average, San Antonio allowed 112 and 111 points to Oklahoma City in their two losses against the Thunder. On the flip side, they held OKC in check in their two wins.

From downtown, the Spurs shot 26.7 and 33.3% in their two losses against the Thunder this season, and while they weren't any better in their two wins, the three is a critical weapon that the Spurs need to continue their championship push.

Leonard, who averaged 21.2 points per game during the regular season, played great against Oklahoma City over the course of four games, averaging 28 points per contest for his <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/splits/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard" target="_blank">highest average against any team this season</a>.

Aldridge didn't play nearly that well against the Thunder in the regular campaign, but he will need to be a key factor on both ends of the floor if San Antonio wants to advance. In essence, if the Spurs are on their game, they are such a well-oiled machine that they will be tough to defeat four times in seven games.
<h2>Who wins?</h2>
Based on the fact that they went 2-2 against each other during the regular season, the Spurs versus the Thunder will be one of the best series of the entire postseason. The strengths of each team could lead to a full-length, seven-game series that will come down to a handful of key plays when all is said and done.

With that, one would think the experience and poise of San Antonio would allow them to prevail. While that's a good reason to like the Spurs' case, the Thunder are hungry. We think their dynamic duo will be on their A-game, leading them to a slight upset to advance to the conference finals.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_925227" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-925227" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kawhi-Leonard-Chris-Covatta-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kawhi Leonard #2 of the San Antonio Spurs drives around Joe Johnson #7" width="757" height="525" /> Kawhi Leonard (No. 2 of the San Antonio Spurs) drives around Joe Johnson. | Chris Covatta/Getty Images[/caption]

There is a difference between being respected and being loved. For instance, thanks to their model of consistency, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-are-the-2015-16-spurs-one-of-the-10-greatest-teams-ever.html/" target="_blank">San Antonio Spurs</a> are respected for being one of the most successful organizations in modern professional sports. However, we’re not so sure they receive the same sort of love; at least not the amount they so richly deserve. We’re here to change that.

With a win over the Toronto Raptors on April 2nd, not only did the Spurs improve to 40-0 at home on the year, but, dating back to last season, they also managed to extend their (franchise-record) home winning streak to 49 straight regular-season games. That’s some serious home-court advantage right there. Show of hands, how many of you would like to take on the Spurs at AT&amp;T Center right now? We wouldn’t either.

Of course, this level of smackdown goes even further, as San Antonio currently find themselves ahead of the heralded 1996 Chicago Bulls in the consecutive home wins race. Not bad. And yet, this run is still only good enough to reach No. 2 on the list, so what did the other levels of home-court dominance look like? Well, here’s a look at the five most impressive of all time. See for yourself.

<h2>5. Boston Celtics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526918 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry-Bird-Tim-DeFrisco-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics sits on the bench during a game.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Winning streak</span>: 38 games

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/" target="_blank">1985-86 Boston Celtics</a> enjoyed coming away victorious on their home floor so much that they began a consecutive winning streak that was eventually picked up by the following year’s club. Starting on December 10, 1985, and continuing all the way through November 28, 1986, the Celtics ran off 38 straight wins at the Boston Garden. Before we forget, this squad from 1985-86 also took home an NBA championship. Must’ve been nice for those living in Boston at the time.
<h2>4. Orlando Magic</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Winning streak</span>: 40

Gone are the days when NBA teams used to dread going into Orlando to take on the Magic. Aside from having to do battle against the dynamic duo of Shaquille O’Neal and Anfernee Hardaway — a scary thought in itself — this group, as a whole, was practically invincible on its home court. From March 21, 1995 to March 19, 1996, the Magic won <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/A5jWF" target="_blank">40 consecutive games</a> at Orlando Arena. It would appear that, at this particular time, Orlando had more than one “Magic Kingdom" to choose from.

<h2>3. Chicago Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_925255" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-925255" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pippen-and-Jordan-BRIAN-BAHR-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan address the media" width="757" height="474" /> Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan address the media | Brian Bahr/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Winning streak</span>: 44 games

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1996.html" target="_blank">1995-96 Chicago Bulls</a> are considered by many to be the greatest team the NBA has ever seen. This group went 72-10, led the league in offensive rating (115.2), defensive rating (101.8), and points-per-game (105.2), and, for better or worse, owned the game entirely. Not to mention, this squad was also part of the longest home-game winning streak in the history of the league prior to the 2015-2016 Season. From March 30, 1995 to April 4, 1996, the Bulls reeled off 44 straight wins on their home floor at the United Center. With numbers like that, is it any wonder that the two gentlemen pictured above have such big smiles on their faces?
<h2>2. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Winning Streak:</span> 49 games

While the casual fan will always gravitate to the wing to find players they adore and admire, the best player the league has ever seen in the post-Jordan vacuum is a tall power forward who speaks quietly, stays out of trouble, and <a href="http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2013/06/06/as-these-23-facts-prove-tim-duncan-is-actually-the-most-entertaining-man-in-the-nba" target="_blank">has a tattoo of Merlin on his chest</a>. While you won't find the same throngs of adoring fans that accompanied Kobe in his prime or LeBron James today, Duncan can boast one better: the Spurs have been arguably the most dominant sports team in American history since he was drafted first overall by the organization in 1997, and San Antonio's worst season since drafting The Big Fundamental <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/" target="_blank">saw them win "only" 50 games</a> (they went 37-13 during the lockout-shortened '98-'99 season for a 74% win rate that year). If the Spurs can avoid dropping their last two games of the season at the AT&amp;T Center, they will become the first team in NBA history to go undefeated at home for an entire season.
<h2>1. Golden State Warriors</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Winning streak</span>: 54 games

We’ve learned that the Golden State Warriors can, in fact, be defeated. However, best of luck trying to topple them on their home floor. Dating back to January 31 of last year and continuing all the way through <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/index.cgi?month=3&amp;day=29&amp;year=2016" target="_blank">their 102-94 victory</a> over the Washington Wizards on March 29, 2016, the defending champs have won <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/team_wins.html" target="_blank">54 consecutive games at ORACLE Arena</a>. Unfortunately for the Dubs, their home winning streak was snapped by the Boston Celtics on April Fool's Day.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_809966" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-809966 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Toni-Kukoc-e1433538487667.jpg" alt="Phil Jackson, in happier times" width="757" height="573" /> BRIAN BARH/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Golden State Warriors are the biggest story in the sporting world right now — with good reason. After taking the 2015 Finals in six games, the Warriors promptly rattled off 24 straight wins to start the season, before finally going down 108-95 in Milwaukee. From there, the shorthanded Warriors clawed through tight wins against Houston and Denver without<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/stephen-curry-highlights-the-most-incredible-shots-of-his-career.html/" target="_blank"> league MVP Stephen Curry</a>, racing to a 31-2 mark and putting the league on notice (they currently sit at a not-too-shabby 69-8). Not bad, you might say, and you would be right. Golden State has reinvigorated the game of basketball with their motion offense, unlimited range, interchangeable parts, and contagious unselfishness.

In setting the gold standard for the modern NBA, it’s inevitable for basketball junkies to start comparing these Warriors to the 72-10 <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1996.html" target="_blank">Chicago Bulls of the 1995-96 season</a>, especially since they're looking like they could break that all-time single-season wins record. Back in December, Charles Barkley <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14391158/chicago-bulls-72-win-team-kill-golden-state-warriors-charles-barkley-says" target="_blank">set off a firestorm of debates</a> when he declared that Michael Jordan and his Bulls “would kill” the “little team” Warriors. More recently, Scottie Pippen offered a similar take, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15123546/scottie-pippen-predicts-1995-96-chicago-bulls-sweep-golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">telling ESPN</a> it would be "Bulls in four."

Obviously Scottie has his own biases, and Sir Charles can come across as a bit of a blowhard — or at least a guy who thought everything was better “back in the day" (his day) — this time they're right: the ’96 Bulls would overwhelm the ’16 Warriors for the following five reasons.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>5. Steve Kerr vs. Steve Kerr</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_706758" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706758" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/492467083-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="506" /> Justin Sullivan/Getty Images[/caption]

This mythical exhibition would match Steve Kerr, the player, against Steve Kerr, the coach. As a player, Steve Kerr put up 8 points, 2 rebounds, and 2 assists per game through five years of service in Chicago. Most importantly, of course, is the fact that Kerr knocked down 48% of his three-point shot attempts as a sharpshooting specialist off the bench. In 1997, Jordan drove the lane against Bryon Russell, before drawing a collapsing Jazz double team in the lane and whipping a pass out to a wide-open Steve Kerr, who, like clockwork, calmly drained the game-winning mid-range shot for the Bulls to take the Finals in six games.

Last year, Steve Kerr went 67-15 through his first regular season as a head coach, before outlasting LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the NBA Finals. With Kerr at the helm, the Warriors often embraced a “small ball” approach, which featured point guards Stephen Curry and Shaun Livingston being flanked by versatile wing players in multiple combinations of Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Andre Iguodala, and Leandro Barbosa.

In this scenario, Kerr, Bulls shooter, would be more valuable than Kerr, Warriors coach. As a Bull, Kerr would spread the Warrior defense thin, while also opening up driving lanes for both Jordan and Pippen to go to work. At the same time, Phil Jackson, the triangle offense, and his 11 rings would stalk the Chicago sideline.

For his part, the guard-turned-coach laughs off the concept, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Kerr-jokes-about-hypothetical-96-Bulls-vs-7225707.php" target="_blank">telling SFGate </a>"[f]irst of all, it’s a really hard question to answer — not just because you're comparing eras, but also because it’s literally tough for me to answer grammatically. I don’t know who 'we' is and who 'they' are. I’ll just say: 'If the two teams played each other, there’s no question that we could beat us and they could beat them.'"
<h2 style="text-align: left"><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left">4. Rule changes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805605" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805605 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Karl-Malone-e1432731064467.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="550" /> DOUG COLLIER/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2004, Ben Wallace squared up against Ron Artest beneath the basket in Detroit after taking a hard foul from the future Metta World Peace. After being separated, Artest actually took to rest upon the scorer’s table, where an unruly spectator promptly doused the forward with beer. From there, the situation immediately escalated, with players openly brawling with fans up in the stands and out on the floor to close out one of the uglier incidents in the history of sports.

In response, David Stern and league executives quickly installed rule changes to “clean up the game" and ease some of the physicality out. The Golden State Warriors and their small ball lineups thrive beneath this new regime, where aggressive hand-checking, brazen trash talk, and physical play are swiftly and harshly penalized by technical fouls, ejections, and stiff fines. Steph Curry, a shifty point guard, excels in the modern game, where he can easily probe the defense at the top of the key or work off the ball through pin down screens for wide-open jump-shots.

The Dynasty Bulls first made their bones beneath the Jordan Rules, where the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/just-how-bad-were-the-bad-boys/" target="_blank">Bad Boy Pistons</a> and <a href="http://www.nba.com/knicks/history/knickerbockersstory.html" target="_blank">Riley-era Knicks</a> eagerly doled out hip checks, elbows, and rough fouls in an attempt to ground the high-flying Bulls. Battle-tested Chicago would be more prepared than the Warriors to adjust their collective game concerning rule changes. With today’s guidelines, Jordan and Pippen would have a field day out of isolation sets and open floor transitions, working over Warrior wings for cheap fouls. And the relatively frail Splash Brothers would barely see the light of day after being hammered through an old school rules format and grind-it-out style.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>3. Dennis Rodman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804606" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804606 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jordan-and-Rodman-e1432332251744.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="585" /> JEFF HAYNES/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Dennis Rodman is the ultimate X-factor in this Golden State versus Chicago clash of titans. In 1996, the Worm was in rare form, leading the league in rebounds with 15 boards per game. On the defensive end, he was more than capable of battling against the likes of Karl Malone and Shaquille O’Neal in the post and contesting shots, before anticipating caroms, boxing out, cleaning the glass, and snapping off a quick outlet to a streaking Jordan. Rodman, an underrated passer, rang up 3 assists per game out of the triangle.

The Warriors' roster simply has no answer for Rodman. If anything, the primary responsibility for Rodman would likely fall to Draymond Green, who is more comfortable operating out on the perimeter in small ball lineups. After Green, Festus Ezeli and Andrew Bogut would face the impossible task of keeping Rodman out of the painted area and offensive glass. An active, feisty Rodman would quickly expose the Warriors for their lack of front-court depth.

On the defensive end, a versatile Rodman would switch out of the pick-and-roll, chase down the Splash Brothers on the perimeter, and still rotate back into the paint for help defense and board work. On the other side of the floor, Rodman would surely punish Golden State by chasing down loose balls and securing backbreaking second-chance opportunities for MJ and Co. to go to work.
<h2 style="text-align: left"><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left">2. Size</h2>
[caption id="attachment_796276" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-796276 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Michael-Jordan-Scottie-Pippen-Vincent-Laforet-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="575" /> Vincent Laforet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Chicago Bulls have the size and strength to overwhelm the Golden State Warriors at every position. Out on the wing, the Bulls can throw out Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Ron Harper as 6-foot-six-plus attack dogs able to drive the lane, operate in space, and shut down the one through three spots. In the front-court, the Bulls can roll out the aforementioned Rodman, and team him up with the likes of Toni Kukoc, Luc Longley, and even Bill Wennington to control the paint. By the fourth quarter, the Bulls would have worn down the diminutive Warriors with timely post ups and physical play.

Most importantly, the Bulls feature four players in Rodman, Harper, Pippen, and Jordan who can switch off screens and guard multiple positions. In doing so, the Bulls can wreak havoc on the pick and roll, while also chasing down and suffocating the Splash Brothers working in and out of screens. On the other side of the floor, Chicago can control the tempo through the triangle and deliberate half-court sets. Both Jordan and Pippen would loom large as matchup nightmares for Curry, Thompson, and Barnes in the post.

The Chicago Bulls, with time and by drawing fouls, would impose their collective will upon the Golden State Warriors and force them out of their wacky lineups and into a more conventional style for significant minutes. The Warriors, with Andrew Bogut at center and Marreese Speights at power forward, are a far less dangerous ball club for any team to match up against.

The Golden State Warriors, of course, must contend with Jordan as the most competitive athlete to ever put on a pair of basketball shorts and step out on the hardwood. No. 23 appeared to take a sick pleasure in breaking the will of every opposing player and fan by halftime. For motivation, a machine-like MJ would have promptly dismissed any talk of the Warriors matching the Bulls, before coming out guns blazing to drop 50, while also demanding the Curry assignment at the other end.

Last season, James kept Cleveland in the Finals by himself, after both Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving went down with injuries. For Game 2, James put up 39 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists to steal a victory on the road at Oracle Arena. In Game 3, James backed up this monster stat line to go off for 40 points, while also taking down 12 boards and dishing out 8 assists. We can expect Jordan to be even more efficient than James in this Bulls versus Warriors series, with the benefit of a healthy supporting cast at his disposal.

History may repeat itself if this series comes down to one final possession, after MJ came up with a timely steal deep in his own territory. After controlling the ball at the top of the key, Jordan could look to cross over, draw the double team, and elevate. In a split second, Jordan would decide to win the game himself or kick the ball back out to a wide open Kerr for the nail in the coffin. It’s gotta be the shoes.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_807916" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-807916 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Draymond-Green-e1433259369396.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Draymond Green | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The NBA is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-is-stephen-curry-really-a-better-scorer-than-jordan.html/" target="_blank">Stephen Curry’s world</a> right now, let’s stop kidding ourselves. His unbelievable season with the Golden State Warriors is all anybody can talk about. He’s the MVP, the best player on the planet (arguably), and he’s doing things nobody has done before. It’s understandable why Curry receives so much attention, but his dominance has caused the world to forget that there are other players doing incredible things as well.

Offensive players always receive more attention than, say, a lockdown defender. Watching players score buckets left and right is, for most fans, more entertaining than watching a guy grab a bunch of rebounds. However, the point of basketball is to score more points than your opponent. Without players who can shutdown the opposition and stop them from scoring, winning championships becomes nearly impossible. Therefore, the value of great defenders can’t be overstated.

So, in case you haven’t been paying attention due to “Curry vision," we wanted to shed light on some of the best defenders in the league. One of these five guys will likely <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/dpoy.html" target="_blank">walk away with the Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) award</a> following the season, so we ranked them in order of likeliness to take home the hardware.
<h2>5. Draymond Green</h2>
We start with Curry’s Golden State teammate Draymond Green, who — <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-4-players-with-the-most-triple-doubles-this-season.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">aside from turning into a triple-double machine</a> this season — has easily proved his worth for the league-best Warriors on the defensive end as well. Among Green’s impressive defensive metrics, he ranks 11th in the league in defensive rating, sixth in defensive win shares, and third in defensive plus-minus.

Green also shows his rebounding ability by grabbing 9.6 boards per game (good for 13th in the league). The Michigan State product has turned into one of the most versatile players in the NBA and can have a positive effect for the Warriors in just about every phase of the game. His defensive value has been critical for Golden State’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-how-the-warriors-will-break-the-bulls-72-win-record.html/" target="_blank">pursuit of history</a> this season, which has to at least put Green in the DPOY conversation .

<h2>4. DeAndre Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757021" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757021" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeAndre-Jordan.jpg" alt="Jared Wickerham/Getty ImagesBOSTON, MA - DECEMBER 11: DeAndre Jordan #6 of the Los Angeles Clippers reacts in the second half against the Boston Celtics during the game at TD Garden on December 11, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement.

While DeAndre Jordan’s biggest claim to fame might be his <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/14315858/how-clippers-lured-deandre-jordan-back-los-angeles" target="_blank">role in last season’s offseason drama</a> between the Clippers and Mavericks, there’s no doubting the huge impact he has on the court. Offensively, Jordan <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_leaders.html" target="_blank">shoots the highest field-goal percentage</a> in the NBA and is a consistent target for Chris Paul’s alley-oops. It’s on defense, though, where Jordan really earns his paycheck. He’s second in blocks and rebounds, securing many of those boards on the defensive end.

Further, the Texas A&amp;M product owns the fifth-best defensive rating in the league and the fourth-most defensive win shares (along with the fourth-best defensive plus-minus). Jordan is the anchor of a defense on a Clippers’ team trying to shock everyone and compete with the top dogs in the Western Conference. With their DPOY-caliber big man on hand, they have a chance to do just that.
<h2>3. Andre Drummond</h2>
Andre Drummond has sort of burst onto the scene for the Detroit Pistons. That’s not to say that he hasn’t been a good player in past seasons, but Dummond has been so good in 2015-16 that he earned his first career All-Star berth. He’s the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_leaders.html" target="_blank">leading rebounder in the league</a> — which is the main thing he’s know for. However, Drummond is also in the top 20 in blocks per game, owns the third-best defensive rating, and the most defensive win shares.

Those numbers on defense have led Drummond to a top-20 ranking in overall player efficiency (which really shows the value of any given player). Seeing as he’s productive on offense — with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/drumman01.html" target="_blank">nearly 17 points per game</a> — for the Pistons as well, Drummond is critical to the success of a potential playoff club. It would be no surprise to see him earn the top defensive honor this season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kawhi Leonard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785406" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785406 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kawhi-Leonard-Spurs-e1428608599544.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="580" /> Kawhi Leonard | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Kawhi Leonard does it all for the San Antonio Spurs. An excellent offensive player, Leonard puts up nearly 21 points per night, shoots the second-highest three-point percentage in the league, and has the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_leaders.html" target="_blank">sixth-highest offensive rating</a> in pro basketball. Those numbers make it hard to believe that Leonard might be even better on the defensive end of the floor.

With nearly two steals per game and a low “field percentage against" mark, Leonard earns the second-most defensive win shares in the NBA and has the second-highest defensive rating. Put it all together and you have the sixth-most efficient player in the game today. MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, whatever it is, Leonard will walk away with some type of hardware this offseason. His ability could lead the Spurs to another championship ring as well.
<h2>1. Hassan Whiteside</h2>
[caption id="attachment_913043" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-913043" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hassan-Whiteside-634x500.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="597" /> Hassan Whiteside | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s time people start paying serious attention to Hassan Whiteside, who has turned into a monster for the Miami Heat. A young player with limited experience entering this season, Whiteside finds himself <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016_leaders.html" target="_blank">leading the league in blocks by a wide margin</a>. He also grabs the fourth-most rebounds in the game and accounts for the fifth-most defensive win shares. Maybe most impressively, Whiteside is the highest-rated defender in the league and has the second-best defensive plus-minus.

Couple all of that with a high shooting percentage and three triple-double games this season and you have the ninth-most efficient player in the NBA. On a team that includes the terrific Dwyane Wade and other pieces, no player may be more valuable to the Heat’s chances at contending this season than Whiteside. A DPOY trophy could be just the beginning of a line of accolades in his career.

		<description><![CDATA[It's well known that Russell Westbrook can rack up triple-doubles with the best of them. Who else ranks in the top 4 for most triple-doubles this season?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_838771" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-838771 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Russell-Westbrook-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="541" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The triple-double is one of the most elusive and impressive feats for an individual player to attain in any given game. You can&#8217;t just be a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba/nbas-8-deadliest-3-point-shooters-of-all-time-2.html/" target="_blank">knockdown shooter</a> who can score at will, a monster on the glass, or a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-10-greatest-nba-point-guards-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">magician in passing</a> the orange. No, only the absolute <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-all-time-great-nba-basketball-players-by-position.html/" target="_blank">best all-around players</a> can do all of those things and more and even then, racking up a score of at least 10 in three of the five categories (points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) can be extremely trying.</p>
<p>Yet for some reason, if you scour the data from recent seasons, you can&#8217;t help but notice a sharp increase in the amount of triple-doubles for the guys at the top of the league. Using the statistics listed on ESPN.com, starting with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/double-doubles/sort/tripleDouble/year/2009" target="_blank">2008-2009 regular season</a>, the figures representing the top triple-double man list as follows: seven, four, four, six, five, and five. Those are the amounts for the league leaders through the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/double-doubles/sort/tripleDouble/year/2014" target="_blank">2013-2014 regular season</a>. Then last season, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/double-doubles/sort/tripleDouble/year/2015" target="_blank">12 different players</a> recorded at least two triple-doubles, while the leader had an astounding 11.</p>
<p>This season, it&#8217;s gotten even more impressive. What&#8217;s more telling is the fact that among the players with at least three of them this season, only one of them would have been considered among the best players in the league entering last fall. One of them is quickly gaining popularity as a top-notch overall talent and the other two are mostly viewed as one-dimensional specialists. With that in mind, here are the four players with the most triple-doubles this season so far.</p>

<h2>4. Hassan Whiteside, Miami Heat</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_913042" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-913042" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hassan-Whiteside-2-640x455.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="538" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015-2016 regular season statistics</span>: 12.8 PPG, 11.4 RPG, 3.9 BLKPG in 48 games played</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triple-doubles</span>: 3</p>
<p>Okay, so <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-breaking-down-anthony-daviss-hall-of-fame-performance.html/" target="_blank">he&#8217;s no Anthony Davis</a>, but Miami Heat center <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteha01.html" target="_blank">Hassan Whiteside</a> is having a pretty remarkable season of his own. With his trio of triple-doubles in 48 games played, the 26-year-old ranks ahead of guys like Marc Gasol, LeBron James, DeMarcus Cousins, Kevin Durant, John Wall, James Harden, and some guy named Stephen Curry. That&#8217;s some pretty darn good company.</p>
<p>After showing signs of becoming a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nba-players-who-are-fantasy-gold-right-now.html/" target="_blank">fantasy basketball star</a> a season ago, Whiteside has dominated this year and is now the best all-around player on a talented Heat roster. Interestingly, when you broaden the statistical output to double-doubles, there are <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/double-doubles/sort/doubleDouble" target="_blank">20 guys</a> ahead of Whiteside in that department as he has &#8220;only" 22. Still, the big man&#8217;s numbers are amazing. He&#8217;s averaging<em> </em>a freaking double-double each time out and nearly four blocks per contest, all in just 28.6 minutes of action per game.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Rajon Rondo, Sacramento Kings</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_909673" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-909673" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rondo-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Kent C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015-2016 regular season statistics</span>: 11.9 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 12.0 APG, in 54 games played</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triple-doubles</span>: 5</p>
<p>Back before the season began, we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-8-places-where-espns-nbarank-got-it-wrong.html/" target="_blank">called out ESPN&#8217;s annual #NBArank</a> for placing newly-signed Sacramento Kings point guard <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rondora01.html" target="_blank">Rajon Rondo</a> at No. 223. We felt that despite the recent downward spiral in the enigmatic player&#8217;s career, he was worthy of a much higher ranking. We&#8217;ll pat ourselves lightly on the back for catching the mistake but we&#8217;ll also say that we did not see this fantastic of a season coming for the former Boston Celtic.</p>
<p>Not only has Rondo surpassed our expectations of placing in the 120-150 range, but he&#8217;s easily been among the top 100 players this year, if not top 50. With his five triple-doubles, Rondo is second among all point guards in the category and his 28 double-doubles put him in third for his position. Following back-to-back disastrous seasons, the guard has stayed out of trouble for the most part this year and is posting tremendous numbers.</p>
<p>Rondo&#8217;s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/assists" target="_blank">league-leading 12 assists per game</a> would be a new career-high, as would his 6.3 rebounds per contest and 36.7% three-point success rate. His minutes per game (35.1), field goal percentage (.450), and points per game (11.9) are also at their highest mark since the 2012-2013 campaign, which incidentally, was when he made his last All-Star team.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_944844" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-944844" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Russell-Westbrook-NBA-Star-Game-2015-qK3BONJssRUl-640x400.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="473" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015-2016 regular season statistics</span>: 24.3 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 10.2 APG, in 58 games played</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triple-doubles</span>: 8</p>
<p>Is it just us or has <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a> become a more valuable player to the Oklahoma City Thunder than <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-top-3-teams-kevin-durant-could-play-for-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a>? Sure, KD has had injuries to deal with and you can&#8217;t fault him for that, but Westbrook has been right there with Kawhi Leonard and LBJ as the best players in the world (after Curry) over the past 12 months. Anyway, the whole Durant vs. Westbrook argument can be saved for another day. Let&#8217;s analyze No. 0&#8217;s awesome numbers.</p>
<p>Westbrook &#8212; who&#8217;s no stranger to triple-doubles &#8212; is posting a monster line of 24.3 PPG, 7.5 RPG, 10.2 APG, and 2.2 SPG. He ranks second in all of basketball with his 39 double-doubles and has played in every one of the Thunder&#8217;s 58 games. Essentially, Westbrook is getting a triple-double about every seven games and the double-double in about 67% of his games this season. That&#8217;s just silly.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>1. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_763069" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763069" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Draymond-Green-640x479.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="567" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2015-2016 regular season statistics</span>: 14.0 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 7.3 APG in 48 games played</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triple-doubles</span>: 11</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors forward <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/greendr01.html" target="_blank">Draymond Green</a> may be having the most well-balanced season that the NBA has seen in some time. It&#8217;s not often that a stretch like Green&#8217;s will be overshadowed, but that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening as one of his teammates is the magical Chef Curry. At the end of the year though, we have a feeling that the voting panel will justly recognize Green&#8217;s prowess this year and he&#8217;ll earn a top-three MVP finish.</p>
<p>Like a five-tool player in baseball, the former Michigan State Spartan has done it all since the season tipped off. His per game numbers are great, but not elite, but when you put them all together you have one of the most impressive players in the business.</p>
<p>In his 34.1 minutes per game, Green&#8217;s numbers look like this: 14.0 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 7.3 APG, 1.3 STPG, and 1.2 BLKPG. He&#8217;s shooting an efficient 48.7% from the field, including a deadly 40.2% from downtown. His 68.1% free-throw success rate and 3.1 TOPG could be better, but that&#8217;s about all between Green and a spotless regular season.</p>

Back in 2015, the Detroit Pistons outlasted the Chicago Bulls 147-144 in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/4-nba-teams-that-look-like-title-contenders.html/" target="_blank">an epic battle of two Eastern Conference squads</a>. We don’t use the term “epic battle" lightly, but this game went into an absurd four overtimes. The quadruple-overtime classic featured nearly 300 combined points, 126 rebounds, 16 lead changes, 16 ties, three foul outs, and lasted three hours and 24 minutes.

Astonishingly, this game was <a href="http://www.allaboutbasketball.us/uncategorized/list-of-longest-games-in-nba-history.html" target="_blank">far from the first</a> to go this long. In fact, Friday’s thriller was the 13th game in league history to go into at least four overtimes according to NBA.com. Now, it’s time for a little basketball history lesson. We’re here to countdown the three longest games in NBA history in terms of overtimes. Remarkably, the Bulls/Pistons contest, as well as nine other quadruple overtime games, don’t make the cut. Let’s see which ones did.
<h2>3. Milwaukee Bucks 155, Seattle SuperSonics 154 (5OT)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: November 9, 1989

Only three games in NBA history have lasted at least five overtimes and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198911090MIL.html" target="_blank">this is the most recent one</a>. The <a href="http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/0028900045/" target="_blank">early-season tilt</a> between the Bucks and SuperSonics had both teams coming in at 2-1 on the season, and neither group would give up. After a tight first half, the Bucks built a six-point lead going into the final 12 minutes. However, propelled by a monster performance from Dale Ellis (53 points, 7 rebounds, 69 minutes played), the SuperSonics fought back to send it into overtime. Finally, in the fifth and final extra period, Milwaukee finished off the never-ending marathon. They were led by Ricky Pierce, who notched a team-high 36 points off of the bench.

<h2>2. Syracuse Nationals 125, Anderson Packers 123 (5OT)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: November 24, 1949

The late Hall-of-Famer, Dolph Schayes, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/194911240SYR.html" target="_blank">helped lead</a> his Syracuse Nationals to a win over the Anderson Packers 125-123. This was the first recorded <a href="http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/0024900095/" target="_blank">five-overtime game</a> in league history, and it is the earliest entry on our list. The Nationals entered play on an early-season hot streak, having won six in a row and coming into the game at 10-1 overall.

The Anderson Packers were no slouches though, entering the contest at 6-2. The Packers actually held an 11-point lead after two quarters, but Johnny Macknowski (21 points), Ray Corley (19 points), and Schayes (18 points) led a comeback in the second half. After battling through the rest of regulation and four overtime periods, Syracuse finally held off their opponents. The Packers were led by Frankie Brian’s 18 points, as he connected on all eight of his free-throw attempts.
<h2>1. Indianapolis Olympians 75, Rochester Royals 73 (6OT)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: January 6, 1951

The <a href="http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/0025000176/" target="_blank">longest game</a> in the storied history of the NBA belongs to the Indianapolis Indians and Rochester Royals. On January 6, 1951, the Olympians <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/195101060ROC.html" target="_blank">knocked off the Royals</a> 75-73 after six stunning overtimes. The end result was actually a bit of an upset, as the Royals came into play at 19-10, while the Olympians were just 15-16. Although it was a completely different era of basketball, it’s interesting to note the stellar defensive efforts by both teams in this one.

The Olympians led 20-10 after a quarter and 38-33 at the half. Rochester cut it to a four-point deficit entering the fourth and sent it to OT with a 12-8 output in the fourth. The overtime periods were simply remarkable. Both teams scored just two points in the first overtime and failed to score in the second frame. Then they each put in a pair of points in the third OT and put up goose eggs in the fourth again.

An “offensive explosion" in the fifth overtime saw eight total points scored, with the Olympians’ two points in the sixth OT allowing them to win by that margin. The Royals’ Arnie Risen had a game-high 26 points, while Ralph Beard and Alex Gorza pitched in with 17 points apiece for the victors. If there was ever a six-overtime game in today’s NBA, we think the score may end up being a little higher than 75-73.

		<description><![CDATA[With the NBA trade deadline quickly approaching, here are 5 players who could be on the move.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_729582" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-729582" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rudy-Gay-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

With the trade deadline coming up fast, things are beginning to heat up in the NBA. Plenty of rumors will surround familiar names as teams ultimately <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-trade-rumors-4-big-name-players-who-could-be-moving.html/" target="_blank">determine if they are sellers or buyers</a> within the next couple of weeks. Here are five players who could suit up in new uniforms next month.
<h2>1. Rudy Gay, Sacramento Kings</h2>
The 29-year-old is no stranger to trade rumors as he has been dealt twice in his career near the trade deadline. That said, his name has once again become a topic of discussion with the All-Star break quickly approaching. However, it’s reported that the Sacramento Kings are only interested in <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2016/1/29/10871138/kings-rudy-gay-trade-rumors" target="_blank">getting a quality young player</a> in exchange for the nine-year veteran. Rudy Gay is in the second year of his four-year, $40 million contract, which includes a player option for the 2017-18 season (when he’s scheduled to make $14.3 million).

It appears that the Kings are gauging interest around the league to see what they could receive in return. Despite missing the last two contests <a href="http://www.csnbayarea.com/kings/rudy-gay-suffers-corneal-abrasion-will-not-play-vs-blazers" target="_blank">due to a corneal abrasion</a> on his left eye, Gay is <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gayru01.html" target="_blank">in the midst of another productive season</a>, averaging 18.0 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, including scoring in double-figures in 35 games this season. The Kings may ultimately stay put with the team as they are currently just a game out of the eighth spot in the Western Conference.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jeff Teague, Atlanta Hawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_803582" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-803582 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jeff-Teague-e1454184058646.jpg" alt="Mike Zarrilli/Getty Images" width="756" height="475" /> Mike Zarrilli/Getty Images[/caption]

The Atlanta Hawks seem to be headed toward their ninth straight trip to the playoffs, but there’s a growing sentiment that the team could make big roster changes prior to the trade deadline. One of the consistently mentioned names is their All-Star point guard, Jeff Teague, who is <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/teaguje01.html" target="_blank">averaging 14.5 points and 5.5 assists</a> per game this season. He has scored in the double-figures 34 times — including nine 20-point outings — and has notched three double-doubles. However, he’s shooting just 42.2% from the field, which is his lowest mark since his rookie campaign.

The Hawks are reportedly willing to listen to offers for the 27-year-old, and it’s believed that the Kings and New York Knicks <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/nba/index.ssf/2016/01/nba_trade_rumors_knicks_intere.html" target="_blank">showed some interest in the point guard</a>. What also makes Teague trade deadline bait is the fact that he has just one year remaining on his contract after this season. The team already possesses a potential replacement in Dennis Schroder, who is averaging career highs in points (10.7) and assists (4.7) in his third year in the league. In all likelihood, Atlanta will hold on to Teague, but if the right deal comes along, expect them to pull the trigger.

<h2>3. Tyreke Evans, New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_939200" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-939200" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-470497762-Tyreke-Evans-New-Orleans-Pelicans.jpg" alt="Tyreke Evans #1 of the New Orleans Pelicans goes in for a layup." width="757" height="511" /> Pool-Getty Images[/caption]

In what’s been a disappointing season for the New Orleans Pelicans, the team could be involved in the trade deadline action. Reports suggest that they are <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/1/19/5325170/nba-trade-rumors-pelicans-open-to-dealing-tyreke-evans-eric-gordon" target="_blank">gauging the league’s interest in guard-forward</a>, Tyreke Evans, who is in the third year of his four-year, $44 million contract. Despite dealing with a nagging knee problem this season, the 26-year-old has put together another strong all-around campaign, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansty01.html" target="_blank">averaging 15.2 points, 6.6 assists, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.3 steals</a> per game.

His stats show a significant improvement from three-point range, hitting a career-best 38.8% of his attempts while knocking down a career-high 79.6% of his free-throw attempts. Evans is also one of four players in the NBA to average at least 15.0 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 6.5 assists (joining the likes of Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Stephen Curry).

With the trade deadline drawing near, Evans could be the hottest commodity on the market given his all-around game and reasonable contract (a base salary of $10 million this season and next year). Although the Pelicans had an extremely slow start to the season, they are only 3.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. If they continue to stay in playoff contention, the former Rookie of the Year could be in the same uniform after February 18.

<h2>4. Kevin Martin, Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746177" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746177" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kevin-Martin-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

If there’s one player who seems to be on the trade block every season, it is Kevin Martin. In his second season with the Minnesota Timberwolves, the 32-year-old averages just 11.3 points while <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/martike02.html" target="_blank">shooting a career-worst 37.5% from the field</a> in 22.6 minutes per game (the lowest minute total since his rookie campaign). His significant dip in production could be attributed to the fact that the team elects to play a pair of young guards, Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins, at his position. This makes Martin a viable option in the trade market for teams hoping to add another scoring option.

With a reasonably-sized deal, the 11-year veteran is in the third year of his four-year, $27.7 million contract. It’s reported that the Timberwolves looked into potential trades back in mid-December and <a href="http://www.hngn.com/articles/169315/20160113/nba-trade-rumors-milwaukee-bucks-have-exploratory-trade-interest-in-kevin-martin.htm" target="_blank">held exploratory talks with the Milwaukee Bucks</a> earlier this month. However, Minnesota seems to desire much more than a salary dump in exchange for Martin. With that in mind, the veteran guard is a likely player to be dealt at the trade deadline.

<h2>5. Markieff Morris, Phoenix Suns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_837419" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-837419 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Marcus-Morris-and-Markieff-Morris-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="507" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s no secret that the Phoenix Suns have long desired to deal forward Markieff Morris this season. The 26-year-old has been disgruntled since the team <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13422503/markieff-morris-says-phoenix-suns-disrespected-dealing-twin-brother-wants-trade" target="_blank">dealt his brother, Marcus Morris, to the Detroit Pistons</a> last offseason. The Suns have had difficulty dealing with No. 11 this season and benched him in early December after starting the first 16 games of the year. Head coach Jeff Hornacek even suspended him for two games later in the month due to “<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14433929/phoenix-suns-suspend-markieff-morris-two-games-towel-throwing-incident" target="_blank">conduct detrimental to the team</a>."<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;line-height: 20px"> </span>

The former first-round pick drew interest from a handful of teams, such as the Pelicans, Houston Rockets, and Cleveland Cavaliers. However, things have yet to truly materialize in trade talks. The Suns reportedly hope to field much greater offers than what they have received so far, but Markieff’s value continues to drop due to his behavior during his fifth season.

When his attitude is right, Markieff <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/morrima02.html" target="_blank">proves to be a productive player</a> as he’s coming off his best season, averaging career highs in points (15.6), rebounds (6.2), and steals (1.2) while starting all 82 regular season games. It’s obvious that the relationship between the Suns and Markieff is damaged beyond repair. If Phoenix is unable to make a deal prior to this trade deadline, it’s just a matter of time before the team finally deals him.

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA isn't exactly loaded with big-name centers anymore, but these 5 teams still need a key player at the position more than most.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The days of Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and David Robinson <a title="seem long gone" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-great-nba-centers-in-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">seem long gone</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t some dominant centers across the NBA. With that said, there are still plenty of teams that desperately need to find a big man who can shut down opponents in the paint. The question is, which  NBA teams need help at the position currently? It&#8217;s tough to find a superstar big man. The five teams below need to find help through the upcoming draft or possibly free agency if they truly want to dominate inside. So let&#8217;s kick it off with the first of five teams who are in need of a force in the paint.</p>
<h2>1. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_862720" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-862720" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cleveland-Cavaliers-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, OH - SEPTEMBER 28: Kevin Love #0 Kyrie Irving #2 and LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers during the Cleveland Cavaliers media day at Cleveland Clinic Courts on September 28, 2015 in Independence, Ohio. (Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images)" width="757" height="504" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Cavaliers may be one of the best teams in the NBA this year, and they have a dynamic trio of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they have their answer at center. Unfortunately, due to their current salary cap situation, the only way they&#8217;ll be able to fix that is through the draft. Currently, Cleveland has Timofey Mozgov and Tristan Thompson controlling the center position, neither of which can be considered &#8220;offensive juggernauts." Both Mozgov and Thompson are solid rebounders, but not much more than that. Expect Cleveland to look to bulk things up inside sooner than later.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2 class="p1">2. Phoenix Suns</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_943500" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-943500" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Suns-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="during the first half of the NBA game at Talking Stick Resort Arena on February 2, 2016 in Phoenix, Arizona.  " width="757" height="504" /> Christian Peterson/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Between Tyson Chandler and Alex Len, someone has to be able to step up, right? Well, Chandler is 33 years old and has proven to be a rebounding big man at best this season, averaging 5.6 points and 8.5 rebounds, while Len isn&#8217;t coming along how many expected. The 22-year-old, third-year center has actually improved in every season with the team, but he&#8217;s just not there &#8212; not by a long shot. On the season, Len is averaging 6.8 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to see him unable to take that next big step, and if he can&#8217;t really turn the corner before the 2015-16 season comes to a close, Phoenix may look for a new big man to fill in their lineup. Let&#8217;s not forget that the Suns have a fair amount of talent with Brandon Knight, Eric Bledsoe, Markieff Morris, Devin Booker, Archie Goodwin, and P.J. Tucker. Knight and Bledsoe specifically have been dealing with injuries, but the talent is definitely there.</p>
<h2 class="p1">3. New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
<p>When you think &#8220;big man" in New Orleans, you probably think about Anthony Davis, and then laugh that his name is on this list. Except that Davis is actually a power forward, even if he can obviously dominate at the center position as well. Now, could you imagine a dominate center lining up next to Davis inside? It&#8217;s pretty scary to think about. Currently, the crop of big men in New Orleans consists of Omer Asik, Alexis Ajinca, and Kendrick Perkins.</p>
<p class="p1">Basically, it&#8217;s time to hit free agency or the draft to find someone to pair up with Davis on the inside. None of those three players are going to scare you much on either side of the ball. With a lineup featuring Davis, Jrue Holiday, Tyreke Evans, and Eric Gordon (when healthy), it&#8217;s pretty easy to understand the frustration from fans on why this team hasn&#8217;t had more success yet. Maybe a new big man inside would help out? Who knows, but it&#8217;s worth thinking about.</p>
<p class="p1"><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2 class="p1">4. New York Knicks</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_626554" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-626554" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/source-Valdezign-Flickr.jpg" alt="source - Valdezign, Flickr" width="757" height="484" /> Valdezign, Flickr[/caption]</p>
<p>Between Robin Lopez, Kevin Seraphin, and Kyle O&#8217;Quinn, it&#8217;s pretty obvious why the Knicks need to find a dominant big man. Lopez isn&#8217;t all that bad and steps up nicely in some spots, but he&#8217;s not truly an offensive weapon. Actually, he hasn&#8217;t really done much on the boards either. He had one solid season with the Portland Trail Blazers when he averaged 8.5 rebounds per game. This season though, he&#8217;s averaged just 9.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks per game.</p>
<p>The Knicks seem to have found a young star in power forward Kristaps Porzingis, so perhaps they can find a big man to pair up with him in the 2016 draft. There are quite a few holes for the Knicks to fill next to Porzingis and Carmelo Anthony, but there&#8217;s no denying that finding a dominant center would be welcomed by all the fans in New York.</p>
<h2>5. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty obvious one to round out the top five teams who desperately need a new center. While the Lakers have a plethora of young or intriguing power forwards in the likes of Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr., and even Brandon Bass and Ryan Kelly (not that they&#8217;ll ever jump the first two names), they need more help. Los Angeles was hoping that Roy Hibbert would be able to come to town and save his career, but that hasn&#8217;t been the case &#8212; not in the slightest.</p>
<p>Hibbert has averaged 6.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks to this point in the season. He will likely be long gone after the year, leaving the Lakers with basically unproven and unreliable options. After Hibbert, Los Angeles has Robert Sacre and Tarik Black on the roster, meaning that it&#8217;s time to hit free agency or the draft to find the answer. Many fans had expected the Lakers to draft Jahlil Okafor with the No. 2 pick last year, but they instead chose to go with D&#8217;Angelo Russell. In turn, it means there&#8217;s still a massive hole to fill.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With the start of 2015-16 NBA season only a few months ago, here's a look at who Vegas is picking to come away with the championship.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we cruise <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-trade-rumors-5-players-who-may-be-traded-before-the-deadline.html/" target="_blank">into the All-Star Break and the trade deadline</a>, everything and nothing has changed for the 2015-2016 NBA season -- that is to say, as far as the sports books are concerned, the same teams that looked like winners back when the schedules were first revealed this offseason. To some degree, this makes sense, because the NBA isn't quite as tied to parity as the NFL. Plus, while it's harder to keep great teams together than it has been in the past (hello,luxury tax) the true contenders are usually ready to stick around for a few seasons, barring injury or illness or an unforeseen turn of events.

All that said, let’s see who the folks in Sin City are picking to win the 2016 NBA Championship.
<h2>5. Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757586" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Blake-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-757586" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Blake-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x491.jpg" alt="Blake Griffin dunking" width="757" height="581" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 30-1</li>
</ul>
There was a point this offseason when the Los Angeles Clippers appeared to be on the verge of losing their place among the Western Conference elite. In fact, it wasn’t too long ago that guard J.J. Redick was asking if he could <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/j-j--redick-gives-clippers-offseason-an-f--unless-there-s-an-f-minus-204408431.html" target="_blank">give the Clippers an F-minus</a> for the team’s disastrous summer. However, that all changed with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-deandre-jordan-changed-nba-free-agency-forever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">D’Andre Jordan’s decision to scorn the Dallas Mavericks</a> and return to Hollywood. Couple that with the team’s signing of Paul Pierce — who brings a much-needed winning mentality with him — and it’s no wonder the oddsmakers in Vegas feel the Clips will be in the thick of the championship race.

<h2>4. Oklahoma City Thunder [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789893" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin-Durant-and-Russell-Westbrook-e1429526700499.jpg"><img class="wp-image-789893 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin-Durant-and-Russell-Westbrook-e1429526700499.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook celebrate" width="757" height="515" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 18-1</li>
</ul>
It makes no difference that the 2015-16 season is Billy Donovan’s first coaching stint in the NBA. It doesn’t matter that the team <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2015.html" target="_blank">finished 45-37 last season</a> and missed out on the playoffs. When it comes to the Oklahoma City Thunder, all that matters is health. If Kevin Durant can remain healthy and Russell Westbrook continues to build off of his dynamic MVP-caliber season, there are few teams in the league as dangerous as OKC. At their best, you can never count out the Thunder.
<h2>3. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 3-1</li>
</ul>
Hold up. Time out. You thought the <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/" target="_blank">San Antonio Spurs</a> were getting too old to compete for NBA championships? No, no. They were just waiting for the right time to replenish their crop of talent. This past offseason seemed like as good a time as any. By landing <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/spurs-sign-lamarcus-aldridge" target="_blank">coveted free agent LaMarcus Aldridge</a> and signing power forward David West for pennies, the Spurs showed they mean business. We never doubted Gregg Popovich and company for a second.

<h2>2. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_782355" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James-and-Kyrie-Irving-e1428074007782.jpg"><img class="wp-image-782355 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James-and-Kyrie-Irving-e1428074007782.jpg" alt="LeBron James and Kyrie Irving high five" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 5-2</li>
</ul>
If <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> can lead the junior varsity version of the Cleveland Cavaliers to within two victories of an NBA title, just think what he can do with a full arsenal at his disposal. According to Vegas, he can win the whole thing. Entering the sophomore season of the latest “Big Three" experiment, the Cavs now know each other's tendencies, have built on-court chemistry, a new head coach, and are a whole year wiser. If all their stars can remain on the court, the odds are in King James’ favor.
<h2>1. Golden State Warriors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_809038" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Steph-Curry-GSW-e1433433708789.jpg"><img class="wp-image-809038 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Steph-Curry-GSW-e1433433708789.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry celebrates three pointer" width="757" height="469" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 6-5</li>
</ul>
Stephen Curry may <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/writer/ken-berger/25268077/stephen-curry-says-its-funny-warriors-are-not-title-favorites" target="_blank">find it “funny"</a> that the Golden State Warriors didn't start the season as across-the-board favorites to repeat as champions, but if we were the reigning MVP, we’d be peeved. This Warriors squad didn’t just come out of nowhere to take the NBA by storm, they dominated the competition all season long. The Dubs may not have made a big splash during the free-agency period, but when you go <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2015.html" target="_blank">67-15 in the regular season</a> and cap it off with a title, it’s more important that you keep your core players in tact. Golden State took care of that by locking up Draymond Green. We expected the Warriors to take these odds personally, using them as bulletin-board material to fuel their fire, and 17 wins in, we're seeing it play out in real time.

		<description><![CDATA[The Los Angeles Lakers will have money to spend, but how will they spend it in 2016 free agency?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_911739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-911739" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Angelo-Russell-Los-Angeles-Lakers-v-Atlanta-Npt2zsM47AZl.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="510" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015&#8217;s NBA free agency, we saw the Los Angeles Lakers swing and miss with quite a few players, including LaMarcus Aldridge, who wound up <a title="with the San Antonio Spurs" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-landing-spots-for-lamarcus-aldridge.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">with the San Antonio Spurs</a>. Aldridge &#8212; who played with the Portland Trail Blazers before finding his way to San Antonio &#8212; chose to go with a legitimate NBA contender instead of a team, the Lakers, who are definitely in rebuild mode.</p>
<p>While LA missed out on Aldridge, it resulted in moves that left the team with Brandon Bass, Lou Williams, and Roy Hibbert. Basically, the Lakers did nothing to prove that they were taking steps toward becoming an NBA contender. Instead, this year became a &#8220;farewell to Kobe Bryant" season. Now, it&#8217;s not purely the above names that place the Lakers at 9-41 with a recent <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14702918/kobe-bryant-los-angeles-lakers-scores-season-high-38-points-help-team-snap-10-game-losing-streak" target="_blank">10-game losing streak</a>, but it is true that no one has stepped up.</p>
<p>Yes, the season is about respectfully saying goodbye to Bryant and making sure he gets his fair share of action, but let&#8217;s look ahead to 2016 free agency. The reason? Well, we want to know if the Lakers will actually make some progress. Here, we check out the biggest rumors and whether or not they&#8217;re legitimate. Let&#8217;s start with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>The Westbrook/Durant duo in Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_703856" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703856" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/490253775-e1411759748969.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="537" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Rumors are heating up concerning two of the hottest names in the NBA winding up with the Lakers. While it may seem a bit crazy, according to Ryan Ward of Examiner.com, there is apparently a &#8220;big possibility" that Durant and Westbrook <a title="both land in Los Angeles" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/lakers-rumors-big-possibility-kevin-durant-russell-westbrook-land-l-a" target="_blank">both land in Los Angeles</a>. Yes, both. Now, the quote originally came from ESPN&#8217;s Stephen A. Smith on ESPN 710&#8217;s Mason and Ireland with Smith stating the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep in mind this, one of the biggest reasons I&#8217;m told, that Kevin Durant may have the Lakers at the top of his list, is because the Lakers have been led to believe, by whom specifically I do not know, but the Lakers have been led to believe that it is a very good chance that the following year Russell Westbrook is coming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there you have it. If there&#8217;s any reason to believe a rumor, it may be this one, right? Why not? Durant and Westbrook in Hollywood sounds like a pretty good deal for both of them, and it&#8217;s obvious that both players realize they can more than just coexist; they can actually dominate alongside each other. We can&#8217;t bank on this rumor too much at this point. However, if this ends up happening, it would be the biggest move, maybe ever, for the Lakers.</p>
<h2>DeMar DeRozan</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_937866" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-937866" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Demar-Derozan-San-Antonio-Spurs-v-Toronto-gC45_btG4u8l.jpg" alt="Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images" width="757" height="473" /> Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>First off, DeMar DeRozan heading home to Los Angeles makes a whole lot of sense in 2016 free agency. So, how would he get there? With a max contract, no question. Many teams will be prepared to offer a max deal to DeRozan, and Zach Lowe of ESPN reports that the Lakers are <a title="one of those teams" href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/14550490/toronto-spent-money-drafted-young-talent-next" target="_blank">one of the teams</a> ready to do so. DeRozan is <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/derozde01.html" target="_blank">having a stellar 2015 campaign</a>, averaging over 23 points per game, with more than four rebounds and four assists as well.</p>
<p>He would not only give the Lakers a serious scorer, but he&#8217;d also be a popular addition in Los Angeles. DeRozan, out of any big name in free agency, seems the most likely to land with the Lakers, as there is likely to be mutual interest between the two parties. Time to play the wait-and-see game, but we may not need to wonder too much, as this signing would almost make too much sense.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>Hassan Whiteside and Al Horford</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_913043" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-913043" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Hassan-Whiteside.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="597" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Last up, let&#8217;s talk about potential big men. Both <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteha01.html" target="_blank">Hassan Whiteside</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/horfoal01.html" target="_blank">Al Horford</a> are unrestricted free agents in 2016. Their abilities to score inside and rebound have to be attractive to a Lakers team looking to figure out what their future looks like at power forward and center. Hibbert will likely be gone in 2016, while Larry Nance Jr. and Julius Randle show potential for the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that the Lakers will make a strong push for Whiteside and try to grab a big man who can defend the paint. In this situation, it allows Los Angeles to continue using both Randle and Nance to figure out who their future power forward is. Now, the real question is whether or not Whiteside or Horford would choose to come to Los Angeles. Whiteside in a Lakers uniform could be perfect for both his career and the team&#8217;s future, but it&#8217;ll also be interesting to see what type of contract he will get.</p>
<h2>Consensus</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_778563" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-778563 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kevin-Durant1-e1427393862332.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="510" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Simply put, the Lakers have some serious potential to do damage in 2016 free agency. Now, we&#8217;ll have to see if they are able to land Durant and decide to hold out a year to grab Westbrook. Regardless, after Bryant retires and Hibbert is off the books, the team will be left with a ton of money and the ability to make a real push for Durant.</p>
<p>Westbrook, DeRozan, and Whiteside/Horford? Those are the real question marks, along with whether or not Durant would even choose Los Angeles. The entire situation will make for a fun offseason, so buckle your seat belt, because the Lakers will have money to spend, and they&#8217;ll likely spend it early and often.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On Monday, the Atlanta Hawks connected on 20 three-pointers, bringing their season average to 10 per game. Where does this rank in NBA history?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_752595" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752595 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kyle-Korver-Atlanta-Hawks-625x500.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="606" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

For their 50th win of the regular season, the eventual first-seed 2014 <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks" target="_blank">Atlanta Hawks</a> asserted their dominance with an impressive <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400579231" target="_blank">130-105 </a>win over the lowly Sacramento Kings. This game was a perfect representation of how lethal this team was collectively (as evidenced by their eventual 60 win season). The 130 points they put up was the highest single game total for the squad during this season, but what made it stand out the most was how accurate they were from three-point range.

The Hawks shot an astounding <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400579231" target="_blank">20-of-36 from deep</a>, setting a new franchise record for most three-point field goals in a single contest. This is just an example of how good this team is when they’re firing on all cylinders. Everyone gets involved and everyone contributes to the success of the team. Not only was this number impressive from a single-game standpoint, but it also increased their total <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/tsl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=team_totals&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;year_min=2015&amp;year_max=2015&amp;franch_id=&amp;c1stat=fg3_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=0&amp;c2stat=&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=fg3_per_g" target="_blank">three-point makes per game to 10 on the year</a>. And that number puts them in select company among the best three-point shooting teams ever. But would this acheivement have made them of one the most prolific teams of all time? Let’s look at the numbers and find out.

Based on the average three-pointers made per game, here are the five best three-point shooting teams in NBA history.

<h2>5. Orlando Magic, 2009-10</h2>
[caption id="attachment_730927" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-730927 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SVG-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point field goals per game:</span> 10.3

Under coach <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/coaches/vangust99c.html" target="_blank">Stan Van Gundy</a>, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2010.html" target="_blank">2009-10 Orlando Magic</a> were one of the best teams in the NBA. They finished the year with a 59-23 and won the Southeast Division. This was a very balanced team that averaged 102.8 points per game, while only giving up 95.3 points per contest. On top of that, the Magic were also a top-four team in both offensive and defensive ratings. With shooters on the team such as <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/redicjj01.html" target="_blank">J.J. Redick</a>, Rashard Lewis, and Jameer Nelson, it’s no wonder this squad made 10.3 three-pointers per game. Unfortunately, their outside shooting wasn’t enough to get them past the Boston Celtics in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2010_ECF.html#BOS-ORL" target="_blank">Eastern Conference Finals</a>.

<h2>4. Houston Rockets, 2012-13</h2>
[caption id="attachment_668782" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-668782 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chandler-Parsons-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="433" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point field goals per game:</span> 10.6

The <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets" target="_blank">Houston Rockets</a> did some damage on the scoreboard during the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2013.html" target="_blank">2012-13 season</a>. They put up 106 points per game, which was the second-highest in the league, and a lot of that had to do with their outside shooting. The Rockets averaged 28.9 three-point attempts per game and they connected on 10.6 of them. Their main snipers from the outside were Francisco Garcia, who shot 38.6% from deep, and <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/chandler_parsons/" target="_blank">Chandler Parsons</a>, who connected on 38.5% of his attempts. Kevin McHale’s Rockets certainly played an exciting brand of basketball during this particular season. However, they couldn’t get past the Oklahoma City Thunder in the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2013_WC1.html#OKC-HOU" target="_blank">first round of the playoffs</a>.

<h2>3. Golden State Warriors, 2014-15</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point field goals per game:</span> 10.8

This season the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> showed the rest of the NBA how it’s done. This team, led by first-year coach <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/nba-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-steve-kerr-mark-jackson-122214" target="_blank">Steve Kerr</a>, scored 110 points per game and topped the league in points, pace, and defensive rating. There’s something truly special happening in the Golden State, and this success can be traced back to the sensational play of the Splash Brothers. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html" target="_blank">Klay Thompson</a> averaged 23.8 and 21.7 points per game respectively, and both shot over 42% from behind the arc. Oh, and they would eventually kill the "jump shooting teams don't win championships" notion when they beat LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.

<h2>2. New York Knicks, 2012-13</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702810" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702810 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4812338191-640x447.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="528" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point field goals per game:</span> 10.9

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/NYK/2013.html" target="_blank">2012-13 New York Knicks</a> won the Atlantic Division, with a 54-28 record, and managed to advance to the second round of the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2013.html" target="_blank">2013 NBA Playoffs</a>. That team excelled under coach Mike Woodson and a lot of it had to do with their ability to knock down three’s. The Knicks made 10.9 three-point field goals per game, which was good enough for tops in the NBA, and they benefitted from having shooters like Steve Novak, Iman Shumpert, and Chris Copeland on the team. However, if you’re going to discuss the Knicks, then there’s no way you can leave out All-Star <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony" target="_blank">Carmelo Anthony</a>. The former Syracuse standout averaged 2.3 field goals from behind the arc per game and he also shot 37.9% from deep. It’s a shame for the New York faithful that this year’s squad will not finish with the same results.

<h2>1. Houston Rockets, 2014-15</h2>
[caption id="attachment_729144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-729144 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/James-Harden-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="456" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Three-point field goals per game:</span> 11.4

The jury is still out as to whether or not the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/2015.html" target="_blank">Houston Rockets</a> can win an NBA Championship, but there is no denying that this team can shoot the rock from deep. The 2014 edition of the squad put up 32.7 three-point attempts per game and knocking down an average of 11.4. It may not be the greatest percentage ever, but it’s still an incredible amount of buckets -- the highest total in league histored, in fact. However, in the end, it’s all about winning, and this team will go only as far as MVP candidate <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html" target="_blank">James Harden</a> can take them.. He scored 27.4 points per game over the regular season and connected on nearly 38% of his shots from downtown.

[also, because we know you're wondering: the 2015 Golden State Warriors are <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2015.html" target="_blank">currently making 10.8 treys per game</a>. You're welcome]

		<description><![CDATA[While James Harden is arguably the best lefty in the NBA today, he's got some work to do if he wants to be considered among the greatest of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_847216" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/James-Harden-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-847216 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/James-Harden-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="James Harden brings the ball up with Dwight Howard trailing" width="757" height="520" /></a> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html" target="_blank">James Harden</a> has been a star in the NBA for quite sometime now, but there’s a difference between a star and a superstar, and Harden didn’t make that leap until last season, when his game got downright dirty. The 6-foot-5 shooting guarded averaged 27.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per contest over the 2014-2015 season. He was absolutely explosive on the offensive end of the floor and affirmed his place among today’s most prolific scorers.

The fans of the sport weren’t the only ones impressed by his dominance — his teammates couldn’t help but feel the same way; especially center Dwight Howard, who caused quite the stir when he took to his <a href="https://twitter.com/DwightHoward/status/638430917011312641" target="_blank">Twitter page</a> to dub Harden the “<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25286321/dwight-howard-calls-james-harden-the-best-left-handed-shooter-ever" target="_blank">best left-handed player ever.</a>"

Considering how opinionated people are, and how expressing one’s outrage is essentially what social media is all about, it’s no surprise that people were a bit displeased with Howard’s remarks. Granted, Dwight eventually clarified that he was talking about “left-handed shooters," but the damage was already done.

Of course, we don’t see it that way. While we don’t agree with the Houston Rockets center, we have no issues with a player going to bat for one of his teammates. That’s what you’re supposed to do. Plus, it provided us with a great topic for discussion, and we’re always thankful for that.

Therefore, while we’re not quite ready to agree with Howard’s assessment (and we may never be), we’ve decided that it was only fitting to provide our own feelings on the matter. With that being said, in our opinion, here’s a list of the five greatest left-handed players in NBA history.

<h2>5. Bob Lanier</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bvc7Vkp9iXE"></iframe>

While he was never able to capture an NBA championship, Hall of Famer <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/laniebo01.html" target="_blank">Bob Lanier</a> was still more than able to hold his own in an era filled with exceptional centers. During his 15-year career with both the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks, Lanier averaged 20.1 points and 10.1 rebounds per contest, while also playing in eight All-Star Games. Although he spent much of his <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/lanier_bio.html" target="_blank">career battling through injuries</a>, it never stopped the Dobber from playing a physical brand of basketball. Given his sweet hook shot and willingness endure pain, it would be wrong not to include Lanier on the list of greatest NBA lefties.

<h2>4. Dave Cowens</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ur3M6b7g2s"></iframe>

If you were looking to find a lefty who played with grit, hustle, and a working-class mentality, look no further than Boston Celtics legend <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/cowens_bio.html" target="_blank">Dave Cowens</a>. In 12 NBA seasons  — 11 with the C’s — Big Red put up <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/cowenda01.html" target="_blank">17.6 points and 13.6 rebounds a game</a>, was an eight-time All-Star, a two-time NBA champion, and the 1972-73 MVP. He was also selected as one of the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/features/nba-at-50-players/index.html" target="_blank">50 Greatest Players in NBA History</a>. With all that being the case, there was no way he wasn’t making this list.

<h2>3. Willis Reed</h2>
[caption id="attachment_847213" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Willis-Reed-David-Becker-Getty-Images-for-Animal-Rescue-Foundation.jpg"><img class="wp-image-847213 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Willis-Reed-David-Becker-Getty-Images-for-Animal-Rescue-Foundation.jpg" alt="NBA player Willis Reed arrives at Tony La Russa's 3rd annual Leaders &amp; Legends Gala" width="757" height="505" /></a> David Becker/Getty Images for Animal Rescue Foundation[/caption]

Most people recognize <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/reedwi01.html" target="_blank">Willis Reed</a> for his inspired and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-gutsiest-sports-performances-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">pain-enduring performance</a> during Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals, but we’re not about to sell his skill short. In 10 seasons, Reed averaged 18.7 points and 12.9 rebounds per game. He played in seven All-Star Games, was All-NBA five times, and won the MVP award during the 1969-70 season. It’s no wonder they called him “The Captain."

<h2>2. David Robinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746955" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/David-Robinson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-746955" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/David-Robinson.jpg" alt="David Robinson in a game against the Sonics" width="757" height="1162" /></a> Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Former San Antonio Spurs center <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/715/david-robinson" target="_blank">David Robinson</a> was as affable off the court as he was talented on it. In 14 NBA seasons, The Admiral averaged 21.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. He was a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html" target="_blank">10-time All-Star</a>, a nine-time All-NBA player, and made the league’s All-Defensive Team eight times. For good measure, he also took home two NBA titles and won the 1994-95 MVP award. Plus, he was super ripped. That definitely counts for something.

<h2>1. Bill Russell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757050" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Russell.jpg"><img class="wp-image-757050" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Bill-Russell.jpg" alt="Bill Russell at the White House" width="757" height="553" /></a> Alex Wong/Getty Images[/caption]

At 6-foot-10, 215 pounds, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html" target="_blank">Bill Russell</a> was among the most dominant players — offensively and defensively — to ever put on an NBA jersey. He won 11 NBA championships — including eight straight from 1958-59 to 1965-66 — played in 12 All-Star Games, and won the Most Valuable Player award five times. Of course, we can’t forget that the Hall of Famer also averaged 22.5 rebounds a game for his career. Not only does Bill Russell belong on the Mount Rushmore of NBA legends, but it’s safe to say the greatest lefty in the history of the National Basketball Association was also the game’s greatest winner.

		<description><![CDATA[Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook just posted a triple-double in his fourth consecutive game. Where does this impressive streak rank historically?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fy05NbPDL0E"></iframe>

If you didn't watch the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder" target="_blank">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> last season, then you’re missing out on one of the greatest individual stretches in the history of the NBA.

Quite simply, when <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a> was playing like a man possessed, and it doesn’t appear like he’s going to stop anytime soon. During the Thunder’s <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400579196" target="_blank">123-118 overtime victory</a> against the Philadelphia 76ers (which, ok, it was against the 76ers), Westbrook exploded with 49 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. This superhero type performance was the <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400579196" target="_blank">fourth straight game with a triple-double</a> for the former UCLA standout, and it more importantly it led to his team getting another notch in the win column. And although winning is really all that matters at this level, we still need to acknowledge that what this kid is doing is pretty special. So special that it’s only happened on a number of occasions.

With that, take a look at the six most impressive triple-double streaks in NBA history.

<h2>5. Magic Johnson (1986-87), Russell Westbrook (2014-15)</h2>
Straight games: 4

<a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/johnsonm_bio.html" target="_blank">Magic Johnson</a> provided a little extra showtime during the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02/gamelog/1987/#557-560-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank">1986-87 season, when he put together four straights with a triple-double</a>. It all started against Houston on March 31, 1987. Johnson would go off for 21 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds. His streak came to a conclusion on April 5, 1987, in a contest versus the Denver Nuggets. Magic would finish that game with 23 points, 10 assists, and 11 rebounds.

What Russell Westbrook did over those four games is not only mind-blowing, it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nbastats/status/573335075422642176" target="_blank">historical</a>. If you put aside the fact that Westbrook has a triple-double in four straight games, and just look at some of the numbers he’s putting up, they’re pretty otherworldly. According to Elias Sports, and courtesy of <a href="http://hoopshabit.com/2015/03/05/breaking-russell-westbrooks-amazing-triple-double-run/" target="_blank">Hoops Habit</a>, Westbrook was just the fifth player in the last 47 years to have a single-game stat line of 45 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. However, when it came to his latest explosion of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;player_id=&amp;match=game&amp;year_min=&amp;year_max=&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;team_id=&amp;opp_id=&amp;is_playoffs=&amp;round_id=&amp;game_num_type=&amp;game_num_min=&amp;game_num_max=&amp;game_month=&amp;game_location=&amp;game_result=&amp;is_starter=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=49&amp;c2stat=trb&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=16&amp;c3stat=&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=10&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;is_trp_dbl=Y&amp;order_by=pts" target="_blank">49 points, 10 assists, and 16 rebounds</a>, Westbrook put himself in a league of his own.

<h2>4. Maurice Stokes (1956-57)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Straight games</span>: 4+

According to <a href="https://twitter.com/nbastats/status/573335075422642176" target="_blank">NBA Stats</a>, another player that went on this crazy triple-double streak was <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stokema01.html" target="_blank">Maurice Stokes</a>. In case you don’t know the name, Stokes was a superstar who was drafted second overall in the 1955 NBA draft, and played three seasons with the Rochester Royals. Unfortunately, his career was cut short because of a <a href="http://grantland.com/features/bryan-curtis-tragic-inspirational-story-maurice-stokes/" target="_blank">devastating injury</a> that was diagnosed as post-traumatic encephalopathy. This was absolutely tragic because his potential was off the charts. He finished his career with averages of 16.4 points and 17.3 rebounds per game. Stokes would be inducted into the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/hof.html" target="_blank">Hall of Fame in 2004</a>.

<h2>2. Oscar Robertson (1961-62), Michael Jordan (1988-89)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Straight games:</span> 7

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/roberos01.html" target="_blank">Oscar Robertson</a> had one of the greatest statistical years in NBA history during the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1962.html" target="_blank">1961-62 season</a>. It was during this season, at the age of 23, that the Big O would go on his <a href="http://www.kki.is/skjol/NBA%20News%20--%20March%2028%202002.htm#3A" target="_blank">seven game triple-double streak</a>. And while that stretch was most certainly a big deal, what made him stand out during that season with the Cincinnati Royals, was Robertson averaged a triple-double for the <em>entire</em> season, with 30.8 points, 11.4 assists, and 12.5 rebounds per game. Good luck achieving that stat line in today’s game.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1035/michael-jordan" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> (pictured) recorded a triple-double in <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01/gamelog/1989/#330-336-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank">seven straight games during the 1988-89 season</a>. His Airness started his streak on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198903250SEA.html" target="_blank">March 25, 1989 against the Seattle SuperSonics</a>, where he went for 21 points, 12 assists and 12 rebounds. The streak would end on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198904060DET.html" target="_blank">April 6, 1989</a>, when the Bulls faced off at the Detroit Pistons. In that game, MJ’s numbers would consist of 31 points, 10 assists, and 13 rebounds. During this impressive run, Jordan ended up scoring over 30 points in five of the seven contests.

<h2>1. Wilt Chamberlain (1967-68)</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Straight games:</span> 9

If there was any player in the history of the NBA who was going to fill up the stat sheets and hold this type of record, it was going to be <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01.html" target="_blank">Wilt Chamberlain</a>. He set the record during the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/chambwi01/gamelog/1968/" target="_blank">1967-68 season</a> as a member of the Philadelphia Warriors, by posting a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/103439/westbrook-comes-up-big-in-ot-win" target="_blank">triple-double in nine straight games</a>. Chamberlain was a force that could barely be contained, which is why Wilt the Stilt finished with career averages of 30.1 points and 22.9 rebounds a game.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Management and leadership advice comes in a host of forms. Conferences, seminars, articles written by CEOs and other corporate executives all detail the path to achieving cohesion in the workplace, or how to be a stronger leader. But the leaders of the boardroom aren’t the only people who know a thing or two about managing difficult personalities, or how to exercise authority.

Retired NBA coach and player Phil Jackson released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-The-Soul-Success/dp/1594205116" target="_blank"><em>Eleven</em></a><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-The-Soul-Success/dp/1594205116" target="_blank"> Rings</a> </em>in May 2013. The book is a memoir about his values, leadership style, and other factors that contributed to his unprecedented eleven NBA championship rings as a coach. Jackson enumerates the 11 principles that assisted his career, and why they are important for everyday life — not just court-side coaching.
<h2>1. Lead from the inside-out</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539519" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539519" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NEW YORK, NY - MARCH 18: Phil Jackson stands for photos during his introductory press conference as President of the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 18, 2014 in New York City.

When you lead from the outside-in, Jackson says, you may have short-term success, but it can’t last. No one wants to be repeatedly “brow-beaten,” and your opponents will eventually discover your game plan. “As time went by, I discovered that the more I spoke from the heart, the more players could hear me and benefit from what I gleaned.”

<h2>2. Bench the ego</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539520" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pau-Gasol-Phil-Jackson-Frazer-Harrison-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539520 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pau-Gasol-Phil-Jackson-Frazer-Harrison-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 20: Los Angeles Laker's Pau Gasol and Former NBA coach and player Phil Jackson attend Children's Hospital Los Angeles Gala: Noche de Ninos at L.A.

“Some coaches insist on having the last word, but I always tried to foster an environment in which everyone played a leadership role — from the most unschooled rookie to the veteran superstar. If your primary objective is to bring the team into a state of harmony and oneness, it doesn’t make sense for you to rigidly impose your authority.”

Jackson says he came to this conclusion after trial-and-error with imposing his will. He realized he needed “to dial back my ego and distribute power as widely as possible without surrendering final authority.”

<h2>3. Let each player discover his own destiny</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539521" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Derek-Fisher-Phil-Jackson-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539521 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Derek-Fisher-Phil-Jackson-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - DECEMBER 01: Derek Fisher #2 of the Los Angeles Lakers speaks to Head Coach Phil Jackson during the game against the New Orleans Hornets at Staples Center on December 1, 2009 in Los Angeles, California.

For Jackson, this was as much about letting players find who they are, but also helping to draw them out as well. By working with players to discover their individual talents, he made them assets to the whole team.

“My approach was always to relate to each player as a whole person, not just a cog in the basketball machine. That meant pushing him to discover what distinct qualities he could bring to the game beyond taking shots and making passes. How much courage did he have? Or resilience? What about character under fire? Many players I’ve coached didn’t look special on paper, but in the process of creating a role for themselves they grew into formidable champions.”

<h2>4. The road to freedom is a beautiful system</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539522" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539522" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="of the Kentucky Wildcats during the game against the Arkansas Razorbacks at Rupp Arena on February 28, 2015 in Lexington, Kentucky." width="757" height="499" /></a> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

As a coach, Jackson used the triangle offense. In this offensive-play system, all five players need to be cooperating, passing, and moving in order to stretch the defense and open up the court for plays. “What attracted me to the triangle was the way it empowers the players, offering each one a vital role to play as well as a high level of creativity within a clear, well-defined structure.” For the strategy to work, Jackson says that, “All five players must be fully engaged every second — or the whole system will fail”

<h2>5. Turn the mundane into the sacred</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539523" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-John-Lithgow-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539523 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-John-Lithgow-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - JANUARY 09: NBA coaching legend Phil Jackson (L) and actor John Lithgow consult their programs before the game between the Arizona Wildcats and the UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion on January 9, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

“As I see it, my job as coach was to make something meaningful out of one of the most mundane activities on the planet: Playing pro basketball.” Jackson admits there is “glamour” to the life of a professional basketball player, but the actual process — the constant traveling and games can be “soul-numbing.” To combat this, Jackson’s players frequently meditated. “I wanted to give players something besides X’s and O’s to focus on. What’s more, we often invented rituals of our own to infuse practices with a sense of the sacred.”

<h2>6. One breath = one mind</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539526" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539526" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="SACRAMENTO, CA - NOVEMBER 03: Head coach Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles Lakers coaches his team against the Sacramento Kings at ARCO Arena on November 3, 2010 in Sacramento, California.

Building on the concept of meditation, Jackson “discovered that when I had the players sit in silence, breathing together in sync, it helped align them on a nonverbal level far more effectively than words. One breath equals one mind.” Through rituals and techniques, he created mindfulness for his teams so they could better connect with one another, preparing them for the teamwork needed on the court.

It also helped free players from needless constraints. “If you place too many restrictions on players, they’ll spend an inordinate amount of time trying to buck the system. Like all of us, they need a certain degree of structure in their lives, but they also require enough latitude to express themselves creatively.”

<h2>7. The key to success is compassion</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539524" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Michael-Jordan-Phil-Jackson-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539524 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Michael-Jordan-Phil-Jackson-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="SALT LAKE CITY, UNITED STATES: Michael Jordan (L) and Chicago Bulls head coach Phil Jackson (R) Most Valuable Player trophy (L) and the Larry O'Brian trophy (R) 14 June after winning game six of the NBA Finals with the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, UT.

“Now, ‘compassion’ is not a word often bandied about in locker rooms. But I’ve found that a few kind, thoughtful words can have a strong transformative effect on relationships, even with the toughest men in the room.”

To illustrate his point, Jackson gives the example of Michael Jordan returning to the Bulls after his brief stint with minor league baseball in the 1990s. Jordan was disconnected from the team, but it took a fight between Jordan and Steve Kerr for Jackson to realize the extent. By having the players get to know and understand each other, Jackson opened up compassion on his team, that enabled them to heighten their level of play.

<h2>8. Keep your eye on the spirit, not on the scoreboard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Kobe-Bryant-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Kobe-Bryant-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="SALT LAKE CITY - MAY 09: Kobe Bryant #24 of the Los Angeles Lakers talks with Head Coach Phil Jackson against the Utah Jazz in Game Three of the Western Conference Semifinals during the 2008 NBA Playoffs on May 9, 2008 at Energy Solutions Arena in Salt Lake City.

“Most coaches get tied up in knots worrying about tactics, but I preferred to focus my attention on whether the players were moving together in a spirited way.” In emphasizing the player, not the score, Jackson is returning to the ideals behind his fourth point, and the triangle offense. The team working together was the most important aspect, all needed to work to be one part moving toward the same goal.

“When a player isn’t forcing a shot or trying to impose his personality on the team, his gifts as an athlete most fully manifest.” Jackson wanted team players, not just in actions on the court, but in their off-court characteristics as well.

<h2>9. Sometimes you have to pull out the big stick</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Lakers-Lluis-Gene-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539529" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Lakers-Lluis-Gene-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="(FromL) Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, Lamar Odom, coach Phil Jackson and Paul Gasol from Spain chat during training session on October 6, 2010 at Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona.

In terms of coaching, Jackson gave players leeway and chances to express themselves, but occasionally, he used what he referred to as “tricks” meant “to wake players up and raise their level of consciousness.” Jackson was trying to teach his players how to react to unplanned and uncontrollable events.

“Once I had the Bulls practice in silence; on another occasion I made them scrimmage with the lights out. I like to shake things up and keep the players guessing. Not because I want to make their lives miserable but because I want to prepare them for the inevitable chaos that occurs the minute they step onto a basketball court.”

<h2>10. When in doubt, do nothing</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539530" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phill-Jackson-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539530" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phill-Jackson-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - DECEMBER 03: Los Angeles Lakers head coach Phil Jackson smiles during the game against the Sacramento Kings at Staples Center on December 3, 2010 in Los Angeles, California.

Not every problem can be tackled with multitudes of energy, and a can-do spirit according to Jackson. “Basketball is an action sport, and most people involved in it are high-energy individuals who love to do something — anything — to solve problems. However, there are occasions when the best solution is to do absolutely nothing.”

<h2>11. Forget the ring</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539531" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Vince-Bucci-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-539531 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Phil-Jackson-Vince-Bucci-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, UNITED STATES: Coach Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles Lakers (L) receives his world championship ring from NBA Commissioner David Stern in ceremony 01 November 2000 in Los Angeles.

It isn’t always about winning, even in a sport, or field that emphasizes records and results.”I know that being fixated on winning (or more likely, not losing) is counterproductive, especially when it causes you to lose control of your emotions. What’s more, obsessing about winning is a loser’s game: The most we can hope for is to create the best possible conditions for success, then let go of the outcome.”

Jackson admits that personally, he hates losing, but he knew that it was of greater importance to emphasize “the journey rather than the goal. What matters most is playing the game the right way and having the courage to grow, as human beings as well as basketball players.”]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[When you look at the current standings, the Eastern Conference looks like the superior conference. But will things stay that way?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_892251" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-892251" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Paul-George-Indiana-Pacers-v-Toronto-Raptors-wrZ-FsP6_nvl.jpg" alt="Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images" width="757" height="564" /> Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For the past several seasons, there&#8217;s never been any question about which conference is superior in the NBA. The Western Conference produces a handful or more teams with 50-plus wins each, and every season the Eastern Conference produces playoff clubs with records well below .500. It&#8217;s so bad that some want to realign the conferences to help solve the imbalance of power within the league. There are also discussions of completely getting rid of the current playoff structure and just seeding the top 16 teams regardless of conference. The East&#8217;s distinction of being the weaker conference for the past several seasons earned it a catchy nickname, the &#8220;Leastern Conference."</p>
<p>There is really no arguing the fact that the West has clearly been better than the East for a long time. However, is the East finally catching up this season? Looking at the current standings, that very well could be the case. Right now, the Eastern Conference runs deep, as 10 clubs currently own records above .500. The West? That conference only has six clubs that make this claim so far. All of this begs the question: Has the East caught up and even potentially passed the West as the superior conference?</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_716409" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716409" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/95229444-e1414184469977.jpg" alt="Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>When you look solely at the top of both NBA conferences, the debate over which conference is better isn&#8217;t even fair. Right now, the West has three teams at the top that are all serious title contenders. First, you have the Golden State Warriors and their measly, single loss, putting their record at an impressive 24-1. Right behind the Warriors are the San Antonio Spurs with a very good record as well, 21-5.</p>
<p>After the Spurs are the Oklahoma City Thunder at 17-8, who are starting to hit their stride with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kevin Durant</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Russell Westbrook</a> (the Thunder are currently riding an NBA high six-game win streak). In the entire league, these might be the top title contenders and they all play in the same conference.</p>
<p>The top three in the East are solid, but nowhere near the level of the West&#8217;s trio of great teams. Of course, the Cleveland Cavaliers are also a top flight title contender with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LeBron James</a> and company. They have a record of 16-7 to top the conference at the moment and should only get better once <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/irvinky01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kyrie Irving</a> returns to the fold. After the Cavs are the Chicago Bulls at a solid 15-8 record.</p>
<p>In third in the East, currently, is the Indiana Pacers, who benefit from a great start by their now-healthy superstar, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paul George</a>. Again, these solid teams are threatening, but they simply don&#8217;t match the West. After these top teams in each conference, however, things get much more interesting when analyzing which conference is better from top to bottom this season.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_842181" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-842181 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dwyane-Wade-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="493" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The East&#8217;s 4-10 teams all look strong early in the new season. The Miami Heat, currently fourth in the conference, sit with a record of 15-9 and a great roster led by <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dwyane Wade</a> and the rising <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/whiteha01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hassan Whiteside</a>. After Miami is the Toronto Raptors at 16-10, then the Charlotte Hornets not far behind with the same number of losses. The Orlando Magic and the Detroit Pistons round out the current top eight in the East, both with records that are three games over .500.</p>
<p>Two teams on the outside of the top eight also hold winning records, those teams being the Boston Celtics and the Atlanta Hawks (last season&#8217;s No. 1 seed in the conference). In the West, you have the Los Angeles Clippers in fourth place with a record of 15-10. They will probably be a contender, too, in the conference with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chris Paul</a> and <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/griffbl01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blake Griffin</a> on hand, but teams 5-10 in the West leave much to be desired.</p>
<p>Currently, the Dallas Mavericks are in fifth and the Memphis Grizzlies are in sixth, both winning teams that usually make the postseason. After that though, you have the Houston Rockets (currently two games under .500) and the Denver Nuggets (three games below the mark) filling out the top eight in the conference. If these standings feel like a role reversal, it&#8217;s true. The East has (for whatever reason) gotten stronger from top to bottom, and the West is suffering. But why?</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_879414" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-879414 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Drummond-and-Caldwell-Pope-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-e1447201273639.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="533" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For now, it&#8217;s probably too early to claim that the Eastern Conference is better than the Western Conference, despite what the standings might indicate. Most teams have only played about 25 games, meaning there is still a ton of season left. The struggling teams in the West will probably start playing better, and those that are playing so well in the East could fall off.</p>
<p>To bring perspective to the West&#8217;s struggles though, you have to understand that those top teams are very good, making those lower teams look much worse than they actually are. The Warriors had that historic 24-0 start, the Spurs are talented, and the Thunder are catching fire. Naturally, that type of success will cause the other teams in the conference to struggle. In the East, while there are some good teams, the discrepancy in talent from team No. 1 to team No. 10 is much lower than the West&#8217;s.</p>
<p>While the East may not be stronger at the top, their top-to-bottom strength has vastly improved, surpassing the West. This is because Eastern Conference teams have collected top talent in the draft for several seasons now, allowing them to improve this season. That&#8217;s why we see the Magic and Pistons the finding some success so far. Funny enough, the East might be even deeper than 10 solid teams, as the Milwaukee Bucks and Washington Wizards have yet to find their groove this season.</p>
<p>So, yes, it seems like the East has caught up to and even passed the mighty West in the NBA. It&#8217;s really about time and it should provide for a more thrilling playoff season once April rolls around.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_536536" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ricky-Davis-Lisa-Blumenfeld-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-536536 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ricky-Davis-Lisa-Blumenfeld-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="507" /></a> Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images[/caption]

Triple-doubles are overrated. There, we said it. While it’s an impressive feat for a basketball player to tally a double-figure total in three different statistical categories (usually points and then two of rebounds/assists/steals/blocks), it’s not <em>that</em> rare. We’re not talking about the basketball equivalent of a no-hitter here. Superstars are able to put up triple-doubles on an occasional to semi-regular basis. The feat <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/yahoo-sports-minute/russell-westbrook-logs-second-fastest-triple-double-nba-085915215.html" target="_blank">has even</a> been accomplished in just 17 minutes of playing time, barely a third of a regulation game. For that matter, <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/players/robertson_summary.html" target="_blank">Oscar Robertson</a> actually <em>averaged</em> a triple-double for an entire season!

Still, for some NBA players who will never achieve superstar status, or for those who could only dream of averaging a triple-double like Robertson did, closing in on that milestone game is still obviously a big deal. Big enough, in fact, for players to be willing to embarrass themselves publicly to try and get that precious last point or rebound.

We took a trip down memory lane to round up five of the worst triple-double attempts in NBA history, with the players listed in alphabetical order. (Because how could we really pick a worst triple-double attempt ever from such a distinguished group of infamous “do anything to get 10, 10, and 10″ performances?) Who would you add to this list?

<h2>Nicolas Batum</h2>
Former Portland Trail Blazer Nicolas Batum (pictured) needed a 40-footer at the horn to get to his triple-double against San Antonio in November 2013, and that’s exactly the shot he took and made. Not exactly the smartest thing to do when your team is already winning by seven points and the sporting thing to do is to just let the clock harmlessly expire. To Batum’s credit, he realized immediately that he had a mistake and apologized profusely after the game for disrespecting his opponent: “That is maybe the worst thing I’ve done in my career,” <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ball-dont-lie/nicolas-batum-last-second-triple-double-attempt-maybe-180456325--nba.html" target="_blank">he said</a>.

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201311020POR.html" target="_blank">Final stat line:</a> 11 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists.
<h2>Anthony Bowie</h2>
In March 1996, Magic guard Anthony Bowie actually called timeout with 2.7 seconds to play and his team leading Detroit by 20 points because he was one assist shy of a triple-double. We’re not sure which coach was the most upset with that decision: Orlando’s Brian Hill, who <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show94transcript.html" target="_blank">handed Bowie</a> the clipboard <a href="http://basketbawful.blogspot.com/2008/06/worst-evers-triple-doubles.html" target="_blank">in disgust</a> so Bowie could draw up the final play, or Detroit’s Doug Collins, who waved his players out of the way for Bowie’s masterpiece play and then led them off the floor before the final horn sounded, drawing a <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1996-03-21/sports/25636960_1_orlando-s-anthony-bowie-doug-collins-new-jersey-s-shawn-bradley" target="_blank">$5,000 fine</a> from the NBA.

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199603190ORL.html" target="_blank">Final stat line:</a> 20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists.

<h2>Ricky Davis</h2>
Cleveland’s Ricky Davis will forever go down in the Triple-Double Hall of Shame after shooting at the wrong basket in the final seconds of a March 2003 game with a 25-point lead over Utah. Davis was attempting to get the final rebound he needed to finish off a triple-double, but apparently, shot attempts don’t really count if they’re taken at the wrong basket? (Funny how that works.) Davis received a hard foul from Utah’s DeShawn Stevenson for his efforts, leading Jazz coach Jerry Sloan <a href="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/03/17/spt_wwwsptsnba17.html" target="_blank">to tell reporters</a>, “I was proud of DeShawn and I would have knocked him down harder. They can put me in jail for saying that, but that’s the way it is.”

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200303160CLE.html" target="_blank">Final stat line:</a> 28 points, 9 rebounds, 12 assists.
<h2>JaVale McGee</h2>
Then-Washington center JaVale McGee (pictured) really wanted his 10th point to get a triple-double. As in, really <em>really</em> wanted that 10th point. McGee made a <a href="http://deadspin.com/5782475/javale-mcgee-and-the-second-worst-triple-double-ever" target="_blank">comedy of errors</a> in the final minutes as he tried desperately to find meaningless point No. 10 in a blowout loss at Chicago. “That was the hardest one point I ever tried to make in my life,” <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=310315004" target="_blank">McGee said</a> after the game. When McGee finally scored with 18 seconds left, he received a technical foul for hanging on the rim <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=310315004&amp;period=4" target="_blank">in celebration</a>. Washington lost the game 98-79.

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201103150CHI.html" target="_blank">Final stat line:</a> 11 points, 12 rebounds, 12 blocks.
<h2>Bob Sura</h2>
Hawks guard Bob Sura was only one rebound from a triple-double against the Nets in April 2004. And not just any triple-double: Sura was looking for his third triple-double in as many games. Sura intentionally missed a layup in the final moments of a 129-107 win, which gave him the milestone, but for less than a day. The NBA went back and adjusted the final statistics <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1781342" target="_blank">because the rules say</a>, “A field goal attempt is a player’s attempt to shoot the ball into the basket…” Since Sura basically admitted he wasn’t trying to score, the shot attempt (and the all-important 10th rebound) didn’t count.

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200404120ATL.html" target="_blank">Final stat line:</a> 22 points, 9 rebounds, 11 assists.

		<description><![CDATA[A handful of high-profile players could be dealt by the trade deadline.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_885767" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-885767 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/randolph.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 4 Big-Name Players Who Could Be Moving" width="640" height="401" /> Zach Randolph | AP Photo/Jae C. Hong[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nba/" target="_blank">NBA</a> season is in full swing now, as we’re over a week into the schedule. While nothing is set in stone, teams have had the chance to see just how good they are, getting a better grasp on what kinds of issues they’ll need to fix in order to succeed.

These sort of problems can be solved at the trade deadline in February, with some teams looking to shed salary, acquire draft picks, or simply begin the process of rebuilding. Every year, there are several players who change teams. But big names don’t often move during the season. For a star player to head to a different team, it usually requires him to be a free agent or for two teams that match up well to be able to sit down and hash it out.

In this 2015-16 season, there are a few big names who could very well head to a new location in just a few months. The first player is Zach Randolph, power forward for the Memphis Grizzlies. Former Grantland writer, Zach Lowe, casually mentioned a few weeks ago that <a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/35-crazy-predictions-for-the-2015-16-nba-season/" target="_blank">Randolph could be dealt</a> if the Grizzlies aren’t as good as they think they’ll be, as Randolph is the oldest of their established stars.
<h2>1. Zach Randolph</h2>
We tend to agree with Lowe on this. Randolph is 34 years old and under contract for one more season after this year, which works against him being able to be dealt. However, Randolph is still a productive player, averaging 16.1 points and 10.5 rebounds per game in 32.5 minutes last season. Including his entire salary this year, he’ll only cost $20 million over the final two years of his deal.

In this day and age and for the production he provides, that’s quite a bargain. A few teams could be looking for a big man with Randolph’s skills at the trade deadline -- and have the means to make such a deal work. Those teams include the New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, and Dallas Mavericks.

<h2>2. Derrick Rose</h2>
[caption id="attachment_573934" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-573934" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chi-bulls-derrick-rose-comments-20141112-640x426.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 4 Big-Name Players Who Could Be Moving" width="757" height="504" /> Derrick Rose | Getty Images[/caption]

The Chicago Bulls are also rumored to be looking at moving on from one of their stars. They’ve had a rocky relationship with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/derrick-rose/" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a> over the last few years; every so often something comes up that leads you to believe they’d move the hometown hero if they could. For example, several days ago there was an unsubstantiated rumor floating around that the Bulls had trade discussions with the Lakers regarding Rose and Taj Gibson in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and a few role players.

While there is no reason to believe that such a trade has been or will be discussed, where there’s smoke there’s usually fire. <a href="http://nba.nbcsports.com/2015/11/04/brian-windhorst-derrick-rose-breakup-with-the-bulls-has-begun/" target="_blank">According to ESPN's Brian Windhorst</a>, the breakup between the two parties has already begun, lending credence to the idea that Rose could be dealt. The main stumbling block is the $41 million left on Rose’s deal over the remainder of this season and next. That means the Bulls would have to find a team with a player making a large salary that they’d be willing to take on.

The injury concerns weigh on this greatly as well, which means the Bulls aren’t likely to be happy with what they can get in return for Rose. Potential matches probably include the Lakers in a deal involving Roy Hibbert and Lou Williams or possibly even a further expanded deal involving Rose and Joakim Noah going to the New Orleans Pelicans for Eric Gordon and Omer Asik.
<h2>3. Ricky Rubio</h2>
Ricky Rubio of the Minnesota Timberwolves makes some sense as a trade candidate too. The Wolves drafted Zach LaVine two years ago to play point guard, and he’s been solid in his NBA career’s limited time so far. Many have wondered if the Wolves will dump Rubio -- who has been a disappointment through the first few seasons of his career -- so they can get LaVine on the court for more minutes. Quite frankly, we're among those individuals.

And yet, despite all that, Rubio is still a young player with strong point guard skills — even if those skills have been in hibernation since his <a href="http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/ricky-rubio-knee-injury-kobe-bryant-video/122262" target="_blank">2012 run-in</a> with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a>. As a result, the Wolves may not be ready to give up on him just yet. Then again, the Houston Rockets did show interest in Rubio in the past. This could be a win-win for all parties involved.

<h2>4. Isaiah Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_860785" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-860785 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Isaiah-Thomas-Mike-Lawrie-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NBA Trade Rumors: 4 Big-Name Players Who Could Be Moving" width="757" height="560" /> Isaiah Thomas | Mike Lawrie/Getty Images[/caption]

The last big move we could see involves the Boston Celtics and their young backcourt. We’re not quite sure whether Danny Ainge thinks keeping Marcus Smart or Isaiah Thomas is the better plan for the long-term, but he’d be wise to decide soon if he wants to move one of them this season.

The Celtics would probably love to include Evan Turner in a deal, and would even be willing to part with Jared Sullinger to make it happen, but that’s getting too involved too early in the season. Teams that could use a point guard and could do a deal with the C’s include the Knicks, Lakers, and Mavericks.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_727157" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-727157" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/145431986-640x430.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="510" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Earlier this year, we took a look at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-5-oldest-active-players.html/" target="_blank">five oldest active players</a> in the NBA. Then more recently, we broke down the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-the-4-youngest-teams-in-basketball.html/" target="_blank">four youngest squads</a> in the league. Today brings us an analysis on the other side of the spectrum with the four teams whose players average age equals the highest among the 30 rosters.

Unsurprisingly, a pair of the five oldest players are members of two of the oldest teams. Additionally, unlike with the teams full of 20-somethings in rebuilding mode and primed for success down the road, this quartet of organizations are for the most part, playing for immediate success.

As a reminder, three of the four youngest teams did not even make the 16-team playoff field last season. The other one was dispatched rather easily in a four-game sweep in the first round. Three of the four teams for this article meanwhile, made the postseason in the spring and the outlier is expected to bounce back with a strong year in 2015-2016.

The next four slides will detail each team’s roster makeup and discuss what the upcoming season may have in store for them. We’ll start with the “youngest" team and work our way up. <em>*Note: According to <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search" target="_blank">the data</a> used from RealGm.com, the three oldest teams are all tied with the same exact average player age.</em>

<h2>4. Dallas Mavericks (Average age: 29.6 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791667" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791667 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dallas-Mavericks-e1429790313343.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="499" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Justin Anderson (21 years old)
<strong>Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Dirk Nowitzki (37 years old)

Head coach Rick Carlisle’s bunch has been <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DAL/" target="_blank">one of the most consistent teams</a> in the NBA over the past seven seasons. Since Carlisle’s first year on the bench in 2008, the team has made the playoffs all but one year (2012-2013,) and won a championship in 2012. We all know that the face of the franchise — Dirk Nowitzki — is nearing the end of his marvelous career though and the team’s window for another NBA Finals run is rapidly closing.

The organization had one of the most interesting off-seasons, as they infamously lost out on the services of DeAndre Jordan. They did pick up sharpshooter Wesley Matthews from Portland, declining point guard Deron Williams from Brooklyn and court jester JaVale McGee off the scrap heap though, to join forces with Nowitzki and Chandler Parsons for one more run. They also utilized their first round draft pick on the talented 21-year-old guard Justin Anderson out of the University of Virginia.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#DAL2015-2016" target="_blank">current Mavericks</a> include one player who was drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by Dallas. They also include three players who were acquired via trade and 13 who were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Nowitzki (37 years old, draft rights to Nowitzki acquired from Milwaukee in June 1998), Parsons (26 years old, signed as free agent in July 2014), Williams (31 years old, signed as free agent in July 2015), and Anderson (21 years old, 21st pick, 2015 NBA Draft.)

<h2>3. Miami Heat (Average age: 30.1 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_731935" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-731935" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Miami-Heat1.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="557" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Justise Winslow (19 years old)
<strong>Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Chris Andersen (37 years old)

Long gone are the days of Dwyane Wade as “Flash." Sure, D-Wade still posted a solid stat line of 21.5 points per game, 3.5 rebounds per game and 4.8 assists per game last season, but it has appeared over the last four years that he is spending as much time on the bench in street clothes, nursing an injury, rather than contributing on the court. Wade’s creaky, aging body is only the start of what seems to be happening to this Miami Heat roster.

As the oldest team in the Eastern Conference, the Heat still had a massively successful off-season in most eyes and look to be primed to again be near the top of the league. They got arguably the biggest steal of the 2015 NBA Draft with Justise Winslow (who is a nice, young piece for the future too), and they re-signed plenty of important pieces including Goran Dragic. Although Miami should make its way back to relevance in the 2015-2016 season, they still are in a three-way tie for the oldest team in the NBA and are certainly in “win now" mode.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#MIA2015-2016" target="_blank">current Heat</a> include three players who were drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by Miami. They also include two players who were acquired via trade and nine who were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Chris Bosh (31 years old, acquired in July 2010 sign and trade with Toronto), Luol Deng (30 years old, signed as a free agent in July 2014), Wade (33 years old, fifth pick, 2003 NBA Draft), and Winslow (19 years old, 10th pick, 2015 NBA Draft.)

<h2>2. Los Angeles Clippers (Average age: 30.1 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789099" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789099 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chris-Paul-e1429273710121.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="588" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Branden Dawson (22 years old)
<strong>Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Pablo Prigioni (38 years old)

The Los Angeles Clippers’ playing style really doesn’t resemble a bunch of old geezers and to be honest, their place on this list probably only comes down to two off-season pickups — Pablo Prigioni and Paul Pierce. Both players in their late 30s were signed as free agents this summer to shore up a now <a href="http://www.nba.com/clippers/roster" target="_blank">stacked, veteran team</a> coached by Doc Rivers.

The Clippers should still be the better (and more exciting) basketball team to reside in LA this year, but aside from Kobe Bryant, the Lakers have the look of a younger and fresher roster now. Don’t expect “Lob City" to go away anytime soon though, especially with Jordan and Blake Griffin still suiting up and in their 20s and with one of the NBA’s best point guards still heaving up their alley-oops.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#LAC2015-2016" target="_blank">current Clippers</a> include three players who were drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by Los Angeles. They also include four players who were acquired via trade and eight who were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Griffin (26 years old, first pick, 2009 NBA Draft), Jordan (27 years old, second round pick, 2008 NBA Draft), Chris Paul (30 years old, acquired in a Dec. 2011 trade with New Orleans), and Pierce (37 years old, signed as a free agent in July 2015.)

<h2>1. San Antonio Spurs (Average age: 30.1 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_779574" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-779574 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/San-Antonio-Spurs_NBA-Finals.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="532" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Nikola Milutinov (20 years old)
<strong>Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Tim Duncan (39 years old)

Tim Duncan is legitimately old enough to be his new teammate Nikola Milutinov’s father. If the San Antonio Spurs make the playoffs (come on, obviously they will) in the spring of 2016, and old “Father Time" Timmy D is still healthy, he could play in a postseason game at the ripe old age of 40, and that is awesome.

Astoundingly, age seems to be just a number for Duncan, and the rest of the Spurs as they are expected to yet again compete for another NBA title in June. (Adding marquee free agent LaMarcus Aldridge over the summer helps a bit too.) Their legendary coach Gregg Popovich is the perfect symbol for what this team is all about: winning, class, a bit of humor, and lots and lots of experience.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#SAN2015-2016" target="_blank">current Spurs</a> include five players who were drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by San Antonio. They also include two players who were acquired via trade and nine players who were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Aldridge (30 years old, signed as a free agent in July 2015), Duncan (39 years old, first pick, 1997 NBA Draft), Kawhi Leonard (24 years old, draft rights to Leonard acquired from Indiana in June 2011), and Tony Parker (33 years old, 28th pick, 2001 NBA Draft.)

		<description><![CDATA[With the passing of legendary dunker Darryl 'Chocolate Thunder' Dawkins, we take a look at the 10 best nicknames in NBA history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_845810" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Darryl-Dawkins-Cindy-Ord-Getty-Images-for-Autism-Speaks.jpg"><img class="wp-image-845810 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Darryl-Dawkins-Cindy-Ord-Getty-Images-for-Autism-Speaks.jpg" alt="Darryl Dawkins attends the Autism Speaks Tip-off For A Cure 2015" width="757" height="505" /></a> Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Autism Speaks[/caption]</p>
<p>On Thursday, the NBA family suffered a major loss: <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13526002/darryl-dawkins-dies-age-58" target="_blank">Darryl Dawkins passed away</a> at a hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania. While Double D only <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/dawkida01.html" target="_blank">averaged 12 points a game</a> for his career and never made an All-Star Game, that doesn&#8217;t take away from the incredible impact he had on the sport of basketball &#8212; or on the backboard, for that matter.</p>
<p>Dawkins was a ridiculous and legendary dunker who brought such power, that it&#8217;s impossible to forget his <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/photos/gallery/_/id/13526964/image/1/darryl-dawkins-retrospective" target="_blank">glass-shattering slams</a>. When word of his passing spread, even NBA commissioner Adam Silver was inclined to acknowledge the influence Dawkins had on the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NBA family is heartbroken by the sudden and tragic passing of Darryl Dawkins," <a href="https://instagram.com/p/656Kv0TcAQ/" target="_blank">Silver said in a statement</a>. &#8220;We will always remember Darryl for his incredible talent, his infectious enthusiasm and his boundless generosity. He played the game with passion, integrity and joy, never forgetting how great an influence he had on his legions of fans, young and old."</p>
<p>And while there was nothing in this statement that we can refute, we do feel there was one important piece of information left out. You couldn&#8217;t talk about Daryl Dawkins without bringing up his amazing nickname &#8212; &#8220;Chocolate Thunder." Strong, powerful and perfect &#8212; we should all thank Stevie Wonder for this incredible gift. It has certainly stood the test of time.</p>
<p>So in honor of the passing of Darryl &#8220;Chocolate Thunder" Dawkins, we think it&#8217;s only right to take a look at the best nicknames the NBA has ever seen. In our humble opinion, these are the 10 best</p>

<h2>10. Hakeem Olajuwon</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Dream"</li>
</ul>
<p>Under normal circumstances, rhyming would usually be a big turnoff in the world of nicknames. But for a player as gifted as Hakeem Olajuwon, we&#8217;re inclined to make an exception. The 7-footer had impeccable footwork, the smoothest touch, and the most incredible post moves. On top of that, he crushed it on the defensive end of the floor, averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/olajuha01.html" target="_blank">3.1 blocks a game</a> for his career. Make no mistake about it, as far as centers go, Hakeem was &#8220;The Dream."</p>
<h2>9. George Gervin</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Iceman"</li>
</ul>
<p>As the late <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/remembering-stuart-scott-as-cool-as-the-other-side-of-the-pillow.html/" target="_blank">Stuart Scott would say</a>, he&#8217;s &#8220;as cool as the other side of the pillow." That was George Gervin. The Hall of Famer never got rattled on the floor, and nothing fazed him or his smooth finger roll. He always remained calm and collected. Gervin was simply ice.</p>
<h2>8. Kevin Garnett</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Big Ticket"</li>
</ul>
<p>As we&#8217;ve documented before, the Minnesota Timberwolves have a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nba-players-who-suffered-in-minnesota.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">history of ruining the sport of basketball</a> for their fans. But back in the day, despite all the disappointment, there was one reason to show up: Kevin Garnett. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1995.html" target="_blank">Ever since 1995</a>, when he jumped to the NBA straight out of high school, KG has been the ultimate show. Intense, talented, and super entertaining. Garnett proved to be worth the price of admission.</p>
<h2>7. Karl Malone</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Mailman"</li>
</ul>
<p>While he was never able to bring an NBA championship back to Utah, power forward <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html" target="_blank">Karl Malone</a> (pictured above left) never failed to bring the goods on a nightly basis. He was big (still is), strong (still is), and unstoppable in the pick and roll. After finishing his Hall of Fame career with a total of 36,928 points &#8212; <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html" target="_blank">second most in NBA history</a> &#8212; there&#8217;s no denying the Mailman delivered plenty of buckets.</p>

<h2>6. Paul Pierce</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Truth"</li>
</ul>
<p>Paul Pierce may be among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-biggest-trash-talkers-in-nba-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">greatest trash talkers</a> to ever sport an NBA jersey, but his actions on the floor always backed up his words. His basketball game was real and honest. It&#8217;s no wonder Shaquille O&#8217;Neal helped give Pierce his moniker. This guy is &#8220;The Truth."</p>
<h2>5. Dominique Wilkins</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Human Highlight Film"</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wilkido01.html" target="_blank">Dominique Wilkins</a> was a special player with insane athleticism. Every time he stepped on the floor, you prepared yourself for something special. And more often than not, it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyUf-9ruJi8" target="_blank">involved an incredible dunk</a>. Wilkins was the ultimate highlight. All he ever need to do was show up.</p>
<h2>4. Allen Iverson</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;The Answer"</li>
</ul>
<p>The toughest pound for pound player in NBA history was there when the 76ers (among others) needed a big play, he was there when the Philly faithful needed a boost, and he was there to take on all challengers. The NBA is filled with many questions, some of which might not be exactly obvious. Regardless of such, you always knew the answer: <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/366/allen-iverson" target="_blank">Allen Iverson</a> (pictured above).</p>
<h2>3. Julius Erving</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;Dr. J"</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever Julius Erving played basketball, he was poetry in motion. He was smooth, fluid, and unbelievably graceful. In the documentary about Erving&#8217;s life, entitled <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2986442/combined" target="_blank">The Doctor</a></em>, it was revealed that the Hall of Famer earned his nickname &#8220;The Doctor" because he used to operate on the opposition. Soon enough, it became shortened to &#8220;Dr. J." Either way, it&#8217;s undeniably awesome.</p>

<h2>2. Michael Jordan</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;Air Jordan"</li>
</ul>
<p>The greatest basketball player of all time could fly. There really is no other way to describe it. Every time <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/175/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> took off, he defied the laws of gravity. Sometimes you wondered if he would ever come back down. He was simply &#8220;Air Jordan." How could everyone not <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/be-like-mike-the-top-7-athlete-commercials-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">want to be like him</a>?</p>
<h2>1. Earvin Johnson</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nickname</span>: &#8220;Magic"</li>
</ul>
<p>One man brought Showtime to Los Angeles. One man revolutionized the point guard position with his height, vision, intelligence, and incredible passing ability. One man did such an incredible things with the basketball in his hands, that you couldn&#8217;t believe it was real. That man was Earvin Johnson. But like everyone else, you know him as &#8220;<a href="http://magicjohnson.com/" target="_blank">Magic</a>."</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Does experience always lead to success in the NBA? Here's a look at the four youngest teams in basketball.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_769173" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-769173" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Philadelphia-76ers-640x429.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="507" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The four youngest teams in the NBA today have not had much success in the last couple of years. Ranging from an <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search" target="_blank">average player age of 24.4 years to 25.5 years</a>, these squads are a far cry from the Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers or San Antonio Spurs: chock-full of savvy veterans with Larry O’Brien aspirations.

Given the fact that the Rockets, Clippers, and Spurs — which, incidentally, are the three oldest teams in the league — <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2015.html?lid=header_playoffs" target="_blank">each made it to the playoffs</a> in the uber-competitive Western Conference last spring, while only one of the four youngest squads reached the postseason, maybe there is some truth to the idea that experience means success in basketball. The one playoff team from the young group by the way, made it by way of the pitiful bottom half of the Eastern Conference only to get swept in the first round.

There’s no doubt that this quartet of teams each have talented rosters with loads of intrigue and promise, but you’d be kidding yourself if you put confidence in any of them to make much noise during the 2015-2016 season.

That being said, let’s take a look at a roster breakdown of the four youngest teams in the NBA starting with the “oldest."

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Boston Celtics (Average age: 25.5 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_711435" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-711435" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/480735695-640x424.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="502" /> Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

<b><i>Youngest player on current roster: </i></b><i>James Young (20 years old)</i><b><i>
</i></b><em><strong>Oldest player on current roster: </strong>David Lee (32 years old)</em>

To quote former Boston Celtics head coach Rick Pitino, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRik9erWgQ8" target="_blank">Larry Bird’s not walking through that door</a>." Pitino’s fiery press conference 15 years ago still fits like a glove when you look at the state of today’s <a href="http://www.nba.com/celtics/roster" target="_blank">Celtics</a>.

The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2000.html" target="_blank">1999-2000 team</a> — the squad that forced Pitino to come up with that bit of press conference gold — finished 35-47, and while last season’s version made the playoffs, it was as the Eastern Conference’s seventh seed with a mediocre 40-42 record. Both rosters are made up of primarily young talent sprinkled in with a couple of veterans and expectations for the 2015-2016 season seem to be comparable with how last year finished.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#BOS2015-2016" target="_blank">current Celtics</a> include five players that were drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by Boston. They also include six players that were acquired via trade and three that were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Avery Bradley (24 years old, 19th pick, 2010 NBA Draft), Marcus Smart (21 years old, 6th pick, 2014 NBA Draft), Isaiah Thomas (26 years old, acquired in Feb. 2015 trade with Phoenix), and Amir Johnson (28 years old, signed as free agent in July 2015).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Orlando Magic (Average age: 25.3 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_783088" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-783088 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elfrid-Payton-e1428333907325.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

<em><strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Aaron Gordon (20 years old)<strong>
Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Channing Frye (32 years old)</em>

Even playing in the inferior East has not catapulted the Orlando Magic into the playoff picture over the past three seasons. In fact, the last time the Magic made the postseason was during the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2012.html" target="_blank">strike-shortened 2011-2012 season</a>, the final year of the ill-fated Dwight Howard/Stan Van Gundy relationship.

Late-spring basketball may still have to wait another season, but Magic fans should be optimistic with <a href="http://www.nba.com/magic/roster/grid" target="_blank">this roster</a> that owner Rob Hennigan and company has built. With Channing Frye, C.J. Watson, and Jason Smith as the only players most would consider veterans on the team, Orlando is ready for some great youthful promise in the coming years.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#ORL2015-2016" target="_blank">current Magic</a> include five players that were drafted by the organization and/or their draft rights were acquired in a trade by Orlando. They also include four players that were acquired via trade and five that were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Aaron Gordon (20 years old, fourth pick, 2014 NBA Draft), Victor Oladipo (23 years old, second pick, 2013 NBA Draft), Elfrid Payton (21 years old, draft rights to Payton acquired in June 2014 trade with Philadelphia), and Nikola Vucevic (24 years old, acquired in Aug. 2012 trade with Philadelphia).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Utah Jazz (Average age: 24.6 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763067" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763067" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rudy-Gobert-Utah-Jazz-640x458.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="542" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<em><strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Trey Lyles (19 years old)<strong>
Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Elijah Millsap (28 years old)</em>

The Jazz are so young that they don’t boast a single player <a href="http://www.nba.com/jazz/roster" target="_blank">older than 28</a>. And their oldest player is something of an outlier, since Elijah Millsap (brother of Atlanta’s Paul Millsap) has just one year of NBA play under his belt playing in just 47 games in 2014-2015. Given this fact, the Jazz may be the most inexperienced team of them all.

Like Orlando, Utah has not made it to the playoffs since 2011-2012 and it would be a shock to many if they made it in the upcoming season. After <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/" target="_blank">finishing 25-77 two years ago</a>, the Jazz hired Quin Snyder as head coach and he led them to a respectable 38-44 record last season.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#UTH2015-2016" target="_blank">current Jazz</a> include eight players that were drafted by the organization and/or their draft right’s were acquired in a trade by Utah. They also include two players that were acquired via trade and seven that were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Gordon Hayward (25 years old, ninth pick, 2010 NBA Draft), Trey Burke (22 years old, draft rights to Burke acquired in June 2013 trade with Minnesota), Rudy Gobert (23 years old, draft rights to Gobert acquired in June 2013 trade with Denver), and Derrick Favors (24 years old, acquired in Feb. 2011 trade with New Jersey).

<h2>1. Philadelphia 76ers (Average age: 24.4 years)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_727495" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-727495" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/76ers-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images2.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="451" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<em><strong>Youngest player on current roster: </strong>Jahlil Okafor (19 years old)<strong>
Oldest player on current roster: </strong>Gerald Wallace (33 years old)</em>

Well, what can you say about the Philadelphia 76ers? On the bright side, the personnel reeks of massive potential, particularly in the front court. On the other hand, the Sixers have won a putrid 37 wins <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/" target="_blank">over the last two seasons</a>. Yeah, that’s both seasons <em>combined</em>.

The <a href="http://www.nba.com/sixers/roster/" target="_blank">projected roster</a> coming into this fall features an interesting mix of guys with impressive college and European-league resumes in their early twenties and even late teens, coupled with aging, formerly above average players like Gerald Wallace and Carl Landry. It’s sad to say, but a good portion of Philadelphia’s success — or lack of it — has simply come down to injuries and bad luck recently. We’ll see if those misfortunes change at all this year.

The <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/transactions/composition_search#PHL2015-2016" target="_blank">current 76ers</a> include four players that were drafted by the organization and/or their draft right’s were acquired in a trade by Philadelphia. They also include five players that were acquired via trade and six that were picked up as free agents. Among the notables are: Joel Embiid (21 years old, third pick, 2014 NBA Draft), Jerami Grant (21 years old, second round pick, 2014 NBA Draft), Jahlil Okafor (19 years old, third pick, 2015 NBA Draft), and Nerlens Noel (21 years old, draft rights to Noel acquired in July 2013 trade with New Orleans).

		<description><![CDATA[While the death of the center as a very real possibility, these five NBA stars are proving the position is just as important as ever.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The franchise center is in danger of extinction. Fans of old school basketball, of course, will always be able to look back nostalgically to Bill Russell blocking shots, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar raining down sky hooks, Hakeem Olajuwon taking over in the post, or even Shaquille O’Neal tearing down the goal on a rim rocking jam. While it was once common knowledge that a strong and dominant center was the ultimate cornerstone for any winning franchise, the game of basketball has evolved over time to showcase perimeter play at the expense of the true blue center.

One of the trickle down wrinkles of this effect is that elite centers are now increasingly comfortable turning and facing the basket. The mid-range game has added another dimension to the center position, while a skilled big man will still combine finesse and power to score easy buckets on the low block. In today’s NBA, an elite center is a luxury, as he is nearly an automatic bucket or foul late in the game. As defenders, great centers routinely step up to erase defensive lapses and back up their teammates. The best five centers in the game right now represent the total package for any aspiring big man to hope to match.
<h2>5. Al Jefferson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733707" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733707 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Al-Jefferson-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Al Jefferson was the lone bright spot for a struggling Charlotte Hornets ball club this season, even though the team disappointed mightily in 2015, going 16 games below .500 overall. Jefferson is a technician on the low block. In the post, he’s known to wheel and deal with an assortment of pump fakes, spins, and drop steps. When on the move, Jefferson can shoot the baby hook with either hand, or even power his way all the way to the basket for the jam. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jeffeal01.html" target="_blank">This season, Al Jefferson averaged 16 points and eight rebounds per game</a>, despite staring down multiple double teams and a dysfunctional locker room each night.

<h2>4. Marc Gasol</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733710" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733710 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Marc-Gasol-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="546" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

We are watching Pau Gasol’s little brother grow up right before our very own eyes, as the Gasol brothers (alongside Chicago’s Joakim Noah) are often cited as the best passing big men in the game today. As a passer, Marc Gasol is especially adept in the high post at playing the angles and finding cutters for easy baskets. He has averaged roughly four assists per game, over the course of the past three seasons.

In Memphis, Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph have forged a unique chemistry on the front line, despite looking like somewhat of an odd couple on paper. Randolph came into the league as a brash youngster out of Michigan State and earned his stripes as a key contributor to the “Jailblazers" era in Portland. Meanwhile, Gasol was working his craft in Spain, and was drafted into the league as a lowly 48th overall pick, in the 2007 draft. Still, both have managed to control the paint through skill in order to make up for their lack of raw athleticism. Gasol, in particular, has rapidly improved his shooting touch and post footwork over the years. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gasolma01.html" target="_blank">In his best season yet</a>, Marc Gasol posted averages of 17.4 points, nearly eight rebounds and just below four assists per game.

<h2>3. Dwight Howard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733711" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733711 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Dwight-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="443" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Dwight Howard, at six-foot-eleven and 265 pounds, is undoubtedly one of the most impressive physical specimens to ever pick up a basketball. In 2008, he actually put his cape on and soared through the air from the free throw line to claim the slam-dunk championship. At the time, Dwight was a loveable kid, who could almost make Orlando fans forget about their original Superman, Shaquille O’Neal. The following year, in 2009, Dwight Howard helped lead an overachieving Magic squad to the NBA Finals, where they ultimately lost to Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, four games to one.

Unfortunately, the league’s love afair with Howard was relatively short lived. In 2011, he was non-committal toward returning to Orlando, making a spectacle of the free agent process and ultimately demanding a trade out of town. The Magic granted Howard his wish, and dealt him to the Lakers in a complicated four-way trade between Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Orlando, and Denver. Dwight lasted one frustrating year in L.A. before moving on to Houston via free agency, in 2013.

In Houston, it is now up to Dwight Howard to use all of his physical tools to transform his reputation away from that of a petulant child and toward a grown man who is serious about winning. Last season, he did post 26 points and 13 rebounds per game, in a wild first round playoff series that the Rockets eventually lost to Portland, 4-2. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/howardw01.html" target="_blank">Over the regular season</a>, a relatively spry Howard came back back to put up per game averages of 19 points, 11 rebounds, and 2 blocks. As a shot blocker, Howard has been tasked with the formidable duty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYJULACcao" target="_blank">cleaning up after James Harden’s mistakes on the defensive end of the floor</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. DeMarcus Cousins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733713" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733713 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DeMarcus-Cousins-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="500" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The walking definition of a natural talent, DeMarcus Cousins’ abilities were never questioned. In one package, Cousins carries a big body that is also exceptionally quick in running the floor and getting off the ground. <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-ballad-of-boogie/" target="_blank">Apparently DMC was ripping down defensive rebounds, going coast to coast, whipping bullet passes, and throwing down tomahawk jams as early as high school</a>. At the same time, rumors of a combative attitude and various run-ins with coaches, players, and officials have also followed Cousins since his time as a schoolboy legend. Jonathan Abrams, in his recent Grantland piece, referred to Cousins as a “tyrant [that] inflicted the most damage on himself.”

This year, at age 24, DeMarcus Cousins has seemingly channeled his passion for the game into productivity, instead of technical fouls and shouting matches with rivals. Cousins just <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/couside01.html" target="_blank">averaged a career-high 24 points per game</a>, while nearly leading the league in rebounding at 12.6 boards per game. As an added bonus, Boogie knocked down 80% of his free throws, which is remarkable for a big man. Going forward, DeMarcus Cousins promises to emerge as the focal point for a young and exciting Sacramento Kings franchise in the loaded West.

<h2>1. Anthony Davis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733716" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733716 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Anthony-Davis-Stacy-Revere-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

In today’s game, Anthony Davis performs somewhat of a hybrid between power forward and center. By any definition, Davis is the most dominant big man in the NBA [Editor’s note: This is why we included him on <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-5-nba-power-forwards-in-the-game-right-now.html/" target="_blank">our top Power Fowards list</a>, too]. Last summer, at 23, Anthony Davis <a href="www.csnchicago.com/bulls/usa-basketball-just-how-good-can-anthony-davis-become" target="_blank">emerged as the “go to” guy on a U.S.A. Basketball team stacked with talent</a>. For many, his performance as the starting U.S.A. center in the FIBA World Cup confirmed that he was the third best player in the NBA, behind LeBron James and Kevin Durant. University of Kentucky head coach John Calipari has already allowed Davis five short years to become the best player in the NBA.

This last season, The Brow appears to be making good upon those predictions, as he <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html" target="_blank">filled up the stat sheet</a> to average roughly 24 points, 11 rebounds, three blocks and two steals per game. A lock-down defender, Anthony Davis has spent his entire career capable of emerging as the most dominant player on the floor, without scoring one point, but this season, he’s expanded his offensive game to include an array of drop steps, up and under moves, and baby hooks on the low block. At this early stage in his career, Anthony Davis already appears to be a once-in-a-generation player.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_713230" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713230 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Michael-Jordan-Vincent-LaForet-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vincent LaForet/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="486" /> Vincent LaForet/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Before a torn rotator cuff <a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12244429/kobe-bryant-los-angeles-lakers-surgery-9-months" target="_blank">sidelined him for the year</a>, Kobe Bryant made NBA history last season. And while that’s nothing new for one of the greatest players ever to wear a basketball jersey, this was not necessarily the sort of history an athlete would want to make. In <a href="http://www.nba.com/lakers/gameday/141111_grizzlies" target="_blank">a game against the Memphis Grizzlies</a>, Bryant missed a shot for the 13,418th time in his long and storied professional career. Miss No. 13,418 for the Black Mamba broke John Havlicek’s NBA record of 13,417, meaning the Lakers legend has now missed more shots than any player in NBA history.

Since it’s understood that you have to take shots to make shots (just like any good home run hitter strikes out an awful lot — right, Adam Dunn?), Bryant leads an impressive list of players that have missed more attempts than any of their counterparts through the years in the Association. So, in honor of Kobe’s record and career, here are the 10 players that have missed the most shots in NBA history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Dirk Nowitzki</h2>
[caption id="attachment_493801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-493801" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dirk-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dirk performing his eponymous one-legged fadeaway" width="757" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The greatest German NBA player of all time (sorry Detlef) is also the greatest Dallas Maverick of all time, and The 7 footer with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY2X8Vj_TMY" target="_blank">the golden voice</a> and deadly array of post moves is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-dirk-nowitzki-made-nba-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">the only player in league history to notch</a> 25,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, 1,000 blocks and 1,000 three-pointers. Along the way, there have been some misses. 10,916 so far, to be exact.
<h2>9. Allen Iverson</h2>
Iverson took 19,906 NBA shots and missed 11,439 of them, giving ‘The Answer” a career field goal percentage of 42.5, lowest on this list. Iverson still averaged 26.7 points per game, but think how good he could have been if he liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGDBR2L5kzI" target="_blank">to practice</a>?
<h2>8. Elgin Baylor</h2>
Elgin Baylor attempted 20,171 shots as an NBA player, and all 20,171 of them came inside the three-point line. Baylor made 43.1% of his attempts, missing a total of 11,478 shots over 14 years as a Los Angeles Laker. He averaged 27.4 points per game and scored 23,149 points in all.
<h2>7. Dominique Wilkins</h2>
Dominique Wilkins missed 11,626 shots out of 21,589 attempts, knocking down better than 46% of his field goals over a 16-year career. The “Human Highlight Film” averaged 24.8 points per game and finished his days as a player with 26,668 career points scored (12th in league history).
<h2>6. Michael Jordan</h2>
Jordan played 15 NBA seasons and attempted 24,537 shots, misfiring on 12,345. The Bulls legend made nearly half of his career shot attempts (49.7%) en route to six league championships and 32,292 career points (which equals more than 30 points per game).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_503745" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-503745" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Kareem-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Skyhook!" width="757" height="504" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

No player in NBA history scored more points than Abdul-Jabbar (38,387), so it’s only fair that he show up in the top five of the “most missed shots” list as well. Kareem missed 12,470 of his 28,307 career shot attempts, finishing with a field goal percentage of 55.9% and a scoring average of 24.6 ppg.
<h2>4. Karl Malone</h2>
The NBA’s <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html" target="_blank">second-leading scorer</a> ever also owns the fourth-highest total of career misses, as the Mailman was unable to deliver on 12,682 of his 26,210 shot attempts. The longtime Jazz standout averaged 25 points a game over his 19 seasons, managing to hit at a clip of 51.6% from the field.
3. Elvin Hayes

Elvin Hayes ranks third on the all-time miss list, as he misfired on 13,296 of his 24,272 shots. Hayes, who tallied 21 points a night, would have had a slightly higher field goal percentage than his 45.2% mark if he’d never shot a three-pointer: He didn’t attempt one until the final five years of his career and finished just 5-34 behind the arc.
<h2>2. John Havlicek</h2>
The aforementioned Havlicek, who played all 16 of his NBA seasons with the Boston Celtics, missed 13,417 of his 23,930 shots. Havlicek’s field goal percentage was 43.9%, which equaled out to a career average of 20.8 points per game.
<h2>1. Kobe Bryant</h2>
By the end of his last NBA game to date, Bryant had increased his record total to 13,766 misses on 25,087 attempts. He’s averaged 25.4 points per game over his 19 years in the NBA, shooting 45.3% from the floor and making a third of his career three-pointers.
<h4>Honorable mentions</h4>
Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen are the next active four players on the <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/11/kobe-bryant-sets-all-time-record-for-misses/" target="_blank">Pro Basketball Talk’s “shots missed” list,</a> so, good news, Dirk and company! The top 10 could still change down the road.

		<description><![CDATA[Klay Thompson's 37-point third quarter broke the NBA record for most individual points scored in a single period. Who else has had similar outbursts?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[

If there was ever any doubt that <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html" target="_blank">Klay Thompson</a> was among the best scorers in today’s NBA, then it was laid to rest during his superb showing in the 2015 NBA Finals, but real basketball heads saw it happen during the regular season against the Sacramento Kings. Back then, Thompson exploded for 52 points as the <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> pummeled the Kings <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201501230GSW.html" target="_blank">126-121</a>. That final number is crazy high, but it’s not what everyone remembers from the game. People remember his <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/1/24/7881499/klay-thompson-chart-speed-37-points" target="_blank">third-quarter performance</a>, because that’s when Thompson went <em>en fuego</em>.

That Friday, Thompson set a new record for most individual points scored in a single quarter, with 37. What? That’s insanity: 37 points, one quarter. Who does that? Well, apparently, Thompson does. But he’s not the only player in the history of the NBA to put up a ton of points in one frame.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Joe Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_711434" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-711434 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457107900.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Kevin Lee/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li>Points scored: 29</li>
</ul>
Brooklyn Nets small forward Joe Johnson has always been a scorer. For his career, he’s averaged 17.4 points per game and has a 43.5% field-goal percentage. He might not be the scorer that he was when he played for the Atlanta Hawks, but if Johnson catches fire from the outside, he’s lights out. And that’s what happened on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201312160BRK.html" target="_blank">December 16, 2013</a> against the Philadelphia 76ers.

In the third quarter, Johnson went off. It was in that period that he put up 29 points of his game-high 37. For the game, Johnson was 13-20 from the field, including 10-14 from three-point range. What a quarter. What a night.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. David Thompson</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Points scored: 32</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompda01.html" target="_blank">David Thompson</a> averaged 22.7 points per game over his career. But he’s never had a scoring outburst quite like the one he had to begin the game on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197804090DET.html" target="_blank">April 9, 1978</a>. His first quarter of that game was truly special.

Thompson’s Denver Nuggets lost to the Detroit Pistons by a final score of 139-137, but the night belonged to him. He scored 32 points in the first quarter on his way to dropping 73 for the game. Yes, we said 73 points. He was a one-man wrecking crew on the floor. If he had gotten more help from his teammates, the final outcome might have been a little different.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Carmelo Anthony, <strong>George Gervin [tie]</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Points scored: 33</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html" target="_blank">Carmelo Anthony</a> (shown in video above) is one of the best scorers of all time. It comes so naturally to the New York Knicks small forward. That night — <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap/_/id/281210007/gameId/281210007/minnesota-timberwolves-vs-denver-nuggets" target="_blank">December 10, 2008</a> — in Denver, Melo’s stroke was so pure and the shots falling so effortlessly that he had no idea he was about to tie a 30-year record. The guy who held the record since <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197804090NOJ.html" target="_blank">April 9, 1978</a>, was one of the greats: <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gervige01.html" target="_blank">George Gervin</a>.

Gervin’s Spurs might have lost the game that night, but “The Ice Man" still led all scorers with a game-high 63 points. It was his second quarter that stood out, in which Gervin dropped 33 points. It was a record that would be his alone for 30 years and shared with another for seven.

Until the following man came along…

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Klay Thompson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_730313" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-730313 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Klay-Thompson-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="530" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li>Points scored: 37</li>
</ul>
To score 37 points in a single quarter is nothing short of spectacular. However, the way in which Klay Thompson when about it is even more sensational. For the quarter, Thompson was <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/01/24/klay-thompson-nba-record-37-points-one-quarter-warriors-kings" target="_blank">13-13 from the field</a>, 9-9 from three, and 2-2 from the charity stripe. It was an absolutely perfect performance.

What’s left to say?

		<description><![CDATA[Dunking is definitely a major part of the NBA, but what if the best dunker in the world doesn't actually play in the league?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Is there anything more thrilling in the sport of basketball than the dunk?

Think about it. It doesn’t matter if the team you’re cheering for is winning or losing, when someone goes flying through the air and slams the ball through the bucket, you can’t help but react. The dunk is electrifying. It’s crowd-pleasing. It makes people get out of their seats and wipe their eyes because they can’t believe what they just witnessed. For the average person, this feat seems inhuman. But for an NBA player, it’s simply another day at the office.

Given that today’s professional basketball players are so strong and athletic, dunking has become somewhat commonplace. Unless the jam comes at the perfect time, “posterizes" an opponent, or changes the momentum of the game, it doesn’t have the same effect that it once did. This could also be a major reason why people weren’t expecting much from this year’s <a href="http://www.nba.com/news/2015-dunk-contest-event-page/" target="_blank">Sprite Slam Dunk Contest</a>. That was, until the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Zach LaVine showed us that we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-top-moments-from-the-nba-all-star-weekend.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">still had much to learn</a> about the art of dunking.

This rookie brought flair back into the contest. He was inventive and fearless, and had even the best dunkers of all time at a loss for words. Finally some excitement was injected into an event that had become stale over the past few years. But what if the contest was still missing something? What if there was another individual out there who could’ve taken the spectacle up a notch? Is that even possible?

Yes, it is. That person exists. His name is <a href="https://instagram.com/jordankilganon/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_campaign=video" target="_blank">Jordan Kilganon</a>, and his dunks are otherworldly. But you’d never know it because this guy doesn’t play in the NBA.

<!--nextpage-->



If you’re looking to grab people’s attention, try nailing a <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/04/man-nails-75-inch-box-drop-instantly-swarmed-by-excitedly-flexing-bros" target="_blank">75-inch box jump</a>. That’s exactly what Kilganon did. And it’s jaw-dropping. Seriously, who is this guy? We had to find out — that’s how impressed we were.

It turns out that Kilganon is a professional dunker who stands just 6-foot-1. Still, that doesn’t prevent him from having a bounce that’s absolutely off the charts. He flies with such force, style, and creativity that even college program St. Mary’s invited him to show off his skills at its <a href="http://blacktopxchange.com/2013/10/10/6-1-jordan-kilganon-put-on-a-show-at-st-marys-midnight-madness/" target="_blank">Midnight Madness in 2013</a>. Talk about crazy leaping ability.

It also appears that this kid is consistently coming up with new tricks, never getting complacent with his talent. For those who believe that, when it comes to dunking, they’ve seen it all, we’ve got news for you: Unless you’ve seen watched this guy’s stuff, you haven’t. Not by a long shot.

There’s no way to diminish what LaVine did in the 2015 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest. After years of lackluster performances, he reinvigorated an event that appeared to be on its last legs. We have no problem calling him the best dunker in the National Basketball Association. But that doesn’t mean he’s the best dunker out there.

After seeing what Kilganon can do, we’re convinced that the best is yet to come. The NBA may be the best basketball league on the planet, but it’s not home to the world’s best high-flier.

Kilganon is <a href="http://dunkademics.com/tag/jordan-kilganon/" target="_blank">on a mission</a>, and we choose to accept it.

		<description><![CDATA[With San Antonio's win over the Miami Heat last night, Kawhi Leonard became one of the 5 youngest players to win Finals MVP.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_499641" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-499641" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Leonard-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="551" /> Hannah Foslein/Getty Images[/caption]

As the dust settled on San Antonio’s 2014 drubbing of the Miami Heat — no team had ever beaten another in the NBA Finals by over 15 points in each victory — the Spurs went absolutely ballistic when 22-year-old Small Forward Kawhi Leonard, the third-year player who the team had traded for on draft night back in 2011, was awarded the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Award. Kawhi, who also achieved the rarest of all NBA feats — a Shaq-given nickname — during that year’s playoff run (Sugar K, as in Sugar K Leonard), averaged 17.8 points, six and a half rebounds, and over one block and one steal a game during the five game series.

For fans of team basketball, as well as fans of arbitrary narratives, this was awesome. They got to watch San Antonio slay the dragons of individual superstardom and top heavy rosters on the backs of some really gorgeous ball movement and exquisite scoring. When Miami strode out to a commanding lead in the opening minutes of Game Five, the crowd resembled 18,000 children that had all discovered the Santa Claus deception at once.

All of which made the eventual Spurs comeback that much more satisfying, and when Manu Ginobili turned back the clock for a rim rattling slam dunk, or when Patty Mills, folk hero of Australian basketball lore, came out of the myth of San Antonio’s Bench to drop 14 third-quarter points and really bury Miami, it was Kawhi Leonard that provided the measured hand when Tim Duncan was on the bench and Tony Parker was missing everything in site. So, without further adieu, here’s where Leonard slots in on the Top 5 Youngest Finals MVP’s of all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 23 years old, 1971</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526372" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526372 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kareem-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Posting up as a Laker" width="757" height="503" /> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Back in 1971, when Kareem was still going by Lew Alcindor, he teamed up with Oscar Robertson to deliver the fastest franchise championship in NBA History, grabbing the team’s first (and only, as of this writing) title a scant two years after their inagural 1969 season. Alcindor, who would later change his name and his team, headed West to the Los Angeles Lakers and eventually became the NBA’s All Time leading scorer, as well as winning Finals MVP again in 1985 — a 14-year gulf that still stands as the largest span between the two awards, although Tim Duncan could match it if he wins the award next year.
<h2>4. Kawhi Leonard,  22 years old, 2014</h2>
When the Miami Heat evened the series at one game apiece after Game 2, there would have been a lot of money to be made betting on Kawhi Leonard. In two games, he’d been a nonfactor, logging a pair of nine point, two rebound games that left him largely invisible on the floor. It’s hard to say which game was better for Sugar K, even when one game ended in Spurs win and the other ended in a loss. Then, uh, this happened. As sweet as that video is, it still downplays how huge Leonard was for San Antonio.



<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Magic Johnson, 22 years old, 1982</h2>
[caption id="attachment_529275" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-529275 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kareem-and-Magic-Kevork-Djansezian-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="560" /> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

Like Leonard, 1982 marked Magic’s second trip to the NBA Finals, and the 22 year, 9 month, and 25 day old Magic would put a cap on his third year in the league by winning a Finals MVP trophy as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, delivering a knockout Game 6 victory to the Philadelphia 76ers to the tune of 104-114, with Johnson piling on a triple double with 13 points, 13 assists, and 13 rebounds.

Of course, Magic was the face of the Laker’s franchise in 1982, while Leonard wasn’t all that far away from being the next Sean Elliot when the season began. There are another couple of key differences, too, but we’ll dive into those in a minute. For now, lets take a look at Kawhi’s teammate and the No. 2 spot on this list:
<h2>2. Tim Duncan, 22 years old, 1999</h2>
As David Aldridge remarked in his postgame interview with The Big Fundamental, Leonard was the youngest player since Tim Duncan won the Finals MVP in 1999. Duncan, though, had turned 22 a scant two months before winning the NBA Finals. So, you know, advantage Timmy Dunks. It’s worth noting, by the way, that this is where the ‘Tim Duncan Is Boring’ legend began, because he was automatic from the low block, which was boring in the wake of Jordan and the glamorous role of the isolation wing scorer, even though Duncan is clearly the best player to come out of the NBA since His Airness. You can see some prime Duncan below — there’s some definite differences, although it’s fairly clear why he wound up as The Big Fundamental.



<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>1. Magic Johnson, 20 years old, 1980</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_510861" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-510861" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Magic-Johnson-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="502" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

That’s right — the biggest difference between Magic Johnson and Kawhi Leonard at age 22 is that, while Kawhi was winning his first Finals MVP award, Magic was winning his second. Johnson, then, is in the unique position of not only being the youngest Finals MVP in NBA history, but also tying for second place, although that’s only if you account for just years as far as age is concerned. In 1980, Magic and Kareem were up against a Philadelphia 76ers squad helmed by Darryl Dawkins and Doctor J. What sealed the deal for Magic’s MVP candidacy, though, was his tremendous Game 6.

After Kareem was ruled out with an ankle injury, Johnson was moved to center, making him the only player to ever start at point guard and center in an NBA Finals series. Of course, he dominated with a 42 point, 15 rebound, seven assist, and three steal outing that included a perfect 14 for 14 from the free throw line. Playing out of position in the NBA Finals. Magic was awesome.

		<description><![CDATA[In sports, a player's popularity can easily be linked with the sale of their gear. With that in mind, here are the 5 most popular jerseys in the NBA today.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_819415" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LeBron-James-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1435697365965.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819415 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LeBron-James-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1435697365965.jpg" alt="LeBron James against the Hawks in the 2015 Eastern Conference Finals" width="757" height="503" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

If you were ever looking to hold a popularity contest in the National Basketball Association, a good place to start would be with the jersey sales. After all, if the people are rocking your number, then it’s safe to say they like you. And according to the numbers on the <a href="http://store.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBAStore.com</a> during the second quarter of the 2015 calendar year, it’s quite clear where the peoples’ hearts lie.

The newly-crowned NBA champion <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> have become the <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">crème</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">de</span> <span class="oneClick-link">la</span> <span class="oneClick-link oneClick-available">crème of <a href="https://twitter.com/NBA/status/615912599440478208" target="_blank">team merchandise sales</a>. From April to June of this year Dubs gear ranks as the most popular in the entire National Basketball Association. While people have made Warriors merchandise the top-selling in the league, fans are also showing their love to other organizations. In order, the Cleveland Cavaliers, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and San Antonio Spurs make up the remaining members of the five highest-selling team merchandise in the NBA. Of course, while basketball will always be a team game, that doesn’t mean there aren’t players who stand out among the rest. </span>

But have no fear, the numbers — and sales — have spoken. The fans have bought their favorite players’ jerseys and they’re more than willing to (indirectly) tell you which individuals have their utmost support. Therefore, using the same criteria — overall sales on NBAStore.com from April through June — here’s a look at the five most popular jerseys in the NBA today.

<h2>5. Klay Thompson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_819408" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Klay-Thompson-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1435697000869.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819408 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Klay-Thompson-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1435697000869.jpg" alt="Klay Thompson quiets the crowd in Game 4 of the 2015 NBA Finals" width="757" height="499" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The 2014-15 season proved to be a breakout year for the former No. 11 overall pick — in 2011 — out of Washington State. Sharpshooter Klay Thompson averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompkl01.html" target="_blank">21.7 points per game</a>, shot 46.3% from the field, and connected on 43.9% of his triples. He was named to his first All-Star team and was a Third-Team All-NBA selection. Of course, if we’re looking for that “standout" moment, all we have to do is look back to his performance on <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201501230GSW.html" target="_blank">January 23, 2015</a> when he dropped <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-hottest-hands-in-nba-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">37 points in one quarter</a> against the Sacramento Kings. With sniper abilities like that, it’s no wonder Thompson No. 5 on the highest-selling jerseys list.

<h2>4. Kyrie Irving</h2>
[caption id="attachment_787680" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kyrie-Irving-e1429040790747.jpg"><img class="wp-image-787680 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kyrie-Irving-e1429040790747.jpg" alt="Kyrie Irving against the Golden State Warriors" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Until he was ultimately brought down by injuries in the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Cleveland Cavaliers point guard <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/kyrie_irving/" target="_blank">Kyrie Irving</a> was one of the most exciting players to watch in the entire league. He has an unbelievable handle, a knack for getting to the bucket, and range for days. He proved to be an invaluable piece in the Cavs turnaround season — notching 21.7 points — and was rewarded for his efforts by being named <a href="http://www.ohio.com/sports/cavs/cavaliers-notebook-still-ailing-kyrie-irving-named-third-team-all-nba-lebron-james-makes-first-team-1.593820" target="_blank">first-ever All-NBA team</a> (third team). It’s clear his popularity amongst fans rose to an entirely new level this season. The fact that his jersey has since become the fourth-highest seller in the NBA only validates this claim.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Derrick Rose</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804973" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Derrick-Rose-e1432586571297.jpg"><img class="wp-image-804973 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Derrick-Rose-e1432586571297.jpg" alt="Derrick Rose shoots a free throw against the Phoenix Suns" width="757" height="525" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

As long as <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rosede01.html" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a> is able to step onto the basketball court, fans will continue to cheer for the ultra-talented point guard. Despite being limited to just 51 regular-season games and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-derrick-rose-doomed-to-be-the-next-penny-hardaway.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">suffering another knee injury</a>, his popularity continues to remain in tact. If you ask us, this will always have to do with his undeniable potential and the fact that he, when healthy, is nearly impossible to contain. His bounce, creativity in the air, and ability to weave through tight spaces is an absolute joy to behold. Fans love their D-Rose and that’s why they still flock in large numbers to buy his jersey.

<h2>2. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_787686" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James-e1429040947310.jpg"><img class="wp-image-787686 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/LeBron-James-e1429040947310.jpg" alt="LeBron James against the Chicago Bulls" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

In the 2015 NBA Finals, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/3704/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> reminded everyone that he is still the best basketball player in the world. With a historical performance — where he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2015-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html?lid=series_status" target="_blank">35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game</a> — the King almost singlehandedly willed the undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the league-best Golden State Warriors and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-the-2015-nba-finals-wont-tarnish-lebrons-legacy.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">further cemented his legacy</a> among the all-time greats. While his jersey sales may have fallen to the No. 2 slot overall, we wouldn’t be surprised to see that change come next season. After all, we don’t think James is quite ready to relinquish his crown just yet.

<h2>1. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_814043" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stephen-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-e1434545244242.jpg"><img class="wp-image-814043 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stephen-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-e1434545244242.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry during Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals" width="757" height="475" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Let the record show that this has been the year of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a>. All-Star. First-Team All-NBA. MVP. NBA champion. The Baby-Faced Assassin has been nothing short of spectacular, as he and the Golden State Warriors have risen to the top of the NBA mountain. His fame and popularity is only matched by the sweetness of his stroke. If you keep cooking, Chef, the people will come. They’ll most likely be sporting your top-selling jersey and they’ll be hungry for buckets.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_822790" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jimmy-Butler-and-Joakim-Noah-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-e1436459475856.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822790 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jimmy-Butler-and-Joakim-Noah-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-e1436459475856.jpg" alt="Jimmy Butler and Joakim Noah chest bump during the NBA Playoffs" width="757" height="520" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

It takes a certain level of talent just to make it to the <a href="http://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">National Basketball Association</a>. It takes an even greater level of skill to reach superstardom. Those who get to that point find themselves in rarified air. Yet if there’s anything we’ve come to realize over the years, it’s that for every superstar, there are a dozen more quality, albeit limited, players who find themselves just as important to a team’s success.

We call these individuals the hustle players; the ones who do the dirty work that’s important, but not recognizable enough to warrant the acknowledgment. It used to be that the value of these folks was seen through the eye test. However, it appears the time has come to change that.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13225337/nba-track-hustle-stats-all-games-las-vegas-summer-league" target="_blank">According to ESPN</a>, the NBA used the Las Vegas Summer League to install a pilot program used to track “hustle stats." Anything from contested two-point and three-point shots to deflections, loose balls recovered, and charges taken will be put into a formula to determine which players hustled the most during any given game. For once it appears we’ll finally be able to measure a player’s heart. Although it’s not as if individuals in the NBA don’t recognize how crucial these plays are.

“It wins games. Hustle wins games," <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat">Miami</a> forward Udonis Haslem said. “Whether you want to keep a stat for it or whether you want to say it’s not a big deal, it wins games. We’re not going out there and just running like a chicken with your head cut off. That’s two different things. I’d say 95 percent of the time, when we win the hustle areas, dominate the loose balls, dominate rebounds, dominate steals, those categories, we win the game. It’s a fact."

With the NBA finally opting to take the nitty and gritty plays and turn them into statistics, we’ve decided to recognize some of the individuals in the game today who best represent this particular category. Therefore, in our opinion, here’s a look at the top five hustle players in the NBA today.

<h2>1. Tony Allen, shooting guard, Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822783" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tony-Allen-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-e1436459143620.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822783 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tony-Allen-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-e1436459143620.jpg" alt="Tony Allen celebrates hitting a shot against the Golden State Warriors" width="757" height="498" /></a> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014-15 Statistics</span>: 8.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 1.4 APG</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/allento01.html" target="_blank">Tony Allen</a> isn’t going to wow you on the offensive end of the floor. That’s not where his specialty lies. No, the Memphis Grizzlies shooting guard makes his money as arguably the best perimeter defender in the entire NBA. He’s smart, patient, and confident in his ability to dictate a game by shutting down some of the game’s premiere scorers. Allen defensive ability has even earned high praise from one of the best to ever step on the floor: Kobe Bryant.

“He’s fundamentally sound defensively and he plays harder than everybody else defensively,” <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20141125/lakers-kobe-bryant-considers-memphis-tony-allen-best-defender" target="_blank">Bryant said</a>. “He has a competitive desire to compete individually. That’s very uncommon. Most defensive players I face want help all the time. I’ve never heard him ask for help. He likes taking the challenge.”

It’s for all of the above, that Tony Allen has been named to NBA First-Team All-Defensive three times in his career. When hits the hardwood, you know what to expect — toughness, pressure, and hustle.

<h2>2. Patrick Beverley, point guard, Houston Rockets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822773" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Patrick-Beverley-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-e1436458970527.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822773 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Patrick-Beverley-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-e1436458970527.jpg" alt="Patrick Beverley sets up a play against the Magic" width="757" height="549" /></a> Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014-15 Statistics</span>: 10.1 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.4 APG</li>
</ul>
At 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/beverpa01.html" target="_blank">Patrick Beverley</a> is far from the biggest guy in the National Basketball Association. However, based on the way he plays, you’d never know it. The Houston Rockets guard never takes a play off. He’s a tenacious defender with an old-school physicality. He scrapes and claws and gets in his opponents’ heads. Coach Kevin McHale loves this kind of player — Beverley’s <em>his</em> kind of player.

The 26-year-old out of Arkansas does the dirty work and thrives in that role. He pressures the ball, fighs around screens, and grabs rebounds on both ends of the floor. He’s such an important part of the Rockets core, the team awarded him a<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2015-nba-free-agency-your-cheat-sheet-to-the-southwest-division.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank"> four-year, $23 million</a> contract extension despite the fact that he tore a ligament in his wrist at the end of the 2014-15 season. On account of his unlimited hustle, there will always be a place for a guy like Patrick Beverley in the NBA.

<h2>3. Tristan Thompson, power forward, Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822787" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tristan-Thompson-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-e1436459265756.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822787 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tristan-Thompson-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-e1436459265756.jpg" alt="Tristan Thompson with the putback dunk in the NBA Finals" width="757" height="533" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014-15 Statistics</span>: 8.5 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 0.7 BPG</li>
</ul>
Anyone who watched the Cleveland Cavaliers make an unlikely run to the NBA Finals, realized how vital power forward <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/4884/" target="_blank">Tristan Thompson</a> was to the team’s success. He’s an extremely hard worker, ferocious on the glass — averaging <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thomptr01.html" target="_blank">4.4 offensive rebounds and 10.8 total per game</a> in the 2014-15 postseason — and a team-first player who knows his role and is <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2015/story/_/id/12819331/tristan-thompson-fits-cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank">completely content with it</a>.

“My role hasn’t changed all season," Thompson said when asked about being thrust into the starting lineup. “Just come in and play hard. Go hard, rebound, defend, get extra possessions and just run the floor."

If this isn’t a perfect example of a top-notch hustle player, then we don’t know what is.

<h2>4. Joakim Noah, center, Chicago Bulls</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822788" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Joakim-Noah-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-e1436459375812.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822788 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Joakim-Noah-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-e1436459375812.jpg" alt="Joakim Noah dives for the ball in the 2015 NBA Playoffs" width="757" height="521" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014-15 Statistics</span>: 7.2 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1.1 BPG</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3224/joakim-noah" target="_blank">Joakim Noah</a> certainly isn’t in the NBA because his shot looks pretty. He’s in the league because he rebounds, defends, dives on the floor, takes charges, and lays his body on the line night in and night out. He is the perfect glue guy on account of his energy, intensity, and tireless motor. Noah’s unrelenting style has earned him two trips to the All-Star Game, three NBA All-Defensive team selections, and the <a href="http://www.nba.com/2014/news/04/21/newser-chicago-bulls-joakim-noah-defensive-poy.ap/" target="_blank">2013-14 NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a> award. In the end, his competitive spirit and all out hustle makes him an invaluable member of the Chicago Bulls.

<h2>5. Matthew Dellavedova</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822802" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matthew-Dellavedova-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1436459993940.jpg"><img class="wp-image-822802 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Matthew-Dellavedova-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1436459993940.jpg" alt="Matthew Dellavedova drives against Jeff Teague" width="757" height="493" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2014-15 Statistics</span>: 4.8 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 3.0 APG</li>
</ul>
In just one postseason, backup guard Matthew Dellavedova went from an unheralded role player to an unlikely folk hero. He was the first one on the ground for loose balls, he pestered MVP Stephen Curry to the point where people actually thought he could be contained and, most importantly, he gained the respect of the best player on the planet. When Dellavedova was accused of being a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-dirtiest-players-in-nba-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">dirty player</a>, LeBron James didn’t hesitant to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/05/lebron_james_matthew_dellavedo.html" target="_blank">stick up for the scrappy Australian</a>.

“This is my teammate, and this is a guy that goes out and works his tail off every single night and people are trying to give him a bad rap," James said. “He doesn’t deserve it, and I don’t like it."

Some basketball players are fortunate enough to have the kind of incredible talent that turns them into superstars. Others are less physically gifted and therefore have to scrap and claw for every inch; they have to fight for their professional survival. Matthew Dellavedova is part of the latter group. And that’s why we root for him.

		<description><![CDATA[A value commodity in the NBA is the ability to knock down free throws. Here's a look at the 5 players in history who did it better than anyone else.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_816764" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stephen-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images2-e1435150502647.jpg"><img class="wp-image-816764 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stephen-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images2-e1435150502647.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry shoots free throw against Houston in the Western Conference finals" width="757" height="466" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Only the talented survive in the <a href="http://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">National Basketball Association</a>. It’s true. If you can cut it, other players will recognize it. And they’ll respect it. If you’re not quite good enough, you will be exposed. You will be made to look like a fool. Faking it in the NBA is impossible, which is why not everyone has what it takes to make a career out of pro ball — often times what helps individuals find a place in this league is a specific role.

If you’re a big body and know how to control it, teams will usually give you a look. If you’re long with quick feet, organizations will see if they can use you as a perimeter defender. If you can knock down the three, you better believe clubs will find value in that. There’s one specialty, though, that may not always guarantee a player a spot in this league: Free throw shooting.

Some players in the NBA check off enough of the boxes that their lack of free throw shooting prowess isn’t a major knock. As a result, you don’t necessarily have to be superb — or above average — from the charity to find success in the NBA. Still, it doesn’t mean that particular skill isn’t much appreciated.

Those who succeed from the charity stripe are described as reliable, clutch, and as having ice in their veins. With the game on the line and the pressure mounting, the ability to step up to the free throw line and knock it down is an important way to gain trust from both your coaches and fellow teammates. And just as it is in all other areas of the sport, some basketball players were way more efficient than others. They have the free throw percentage to prove it.

With that in mind, here’s a look at the five best free throw shooters in NBA history.

<h2>5. Peja Stojakovic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_816616" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Peja-Stojakovich-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1435092486230.jpg"><img class="wp-image-816616 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Peja-Stojakovich-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1435092486230.jpg" alt="Peja Stojakovich dribbles against the Utah Jazz" width="757" height="530" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Throw Percentage</span>: 89.48%</li>
</ul>
Drafted by the Sacramento Kings with the 14th overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/3119/" target="_blank">Peja Stojakovich</a> spent the better part of his 13-year career striking fear in the hearts of opposing defenses with his sweet stroke from the outside. During his time on the NBA hardwood, the three-time All-Star connected on 40.1% of his threes — including a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2004.html" target="_blank">league-best 240 makes in 2003-2004</a> — and shot 45% from the field. But he was even more automatic from the free throw line. He led the NBA in free throw percentage in both the 2003-04 (92.7%) and 2007-08 (92.9%) seasons, and never shot below 81.6% in any single season. It’s that level of consistency that helped land him on this list.

<h2>4. Rick Barry</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tU88dxJKTHI" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Throw Percentage</span>: 89.98%</li>
</ul>
As of this writing, Rick Barry is the only player on this list to have been been inducted into the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/hof.html" target="_blank">NBA Hall of Fame</a>. While we’re sure that won’t always be the case, that doesn’t take away from Barry’s accomplishments whatsoever. Not only was The Miami Greyhound known for his scoring prowess — he averaged 24.8 for his career — but he was also recognized for his sensational shooting from the charity stripe; especially since he shot the ball underhanded. Considering <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/barryri01.html" target="_blank">led the league in free throw percentage seven times</a>, we’re surprised more players didn’t adopt the granny style. Maybe then, they too, would shoot just under 90% for their careers.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Stephen Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748359" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Steph-Curry-Victor-Decolongon-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-748359 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Steph-Curry-Victor-Decolongon-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Curry against the Los Angeles Clippers" width="640" height="426" /></a> Victor Decolongon/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Throw Percentage</span>: 90.00%</li>
</ul>
What else can you say about <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a>?

He’s an MVP, an NBA champion, and arguably the greatest shooter the game has ever seen. When the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2015-nba-finals-how-stephen-curry-finally-cooked-the-cavs.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Chef is cooking</a>, watch out. He doesn’t need much space to get off that pretty shot and his release is lightning quick. But don’t think for a moment that getting up in his grill will prevent him from making things happen. With his smooth handle, the Baby-Faced Assassin is more than capable of creating his own shot. Worse yet for defenders, if you send him to the free throw line, you’re pretty much gifting points to the Golden State Warriors. In his six seasons in the NBA, Curry has led the league in free throw percentage twice, and now sits will a <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">career average of 90%</a>. At just 27 years of age — with plenty of good years left — who knows how high he can climb.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Mark Price</h2>
[caption id="attachment_816618" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mark-Price-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images-e1435092696571.jpg"><img class="wp-image-816618 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mark-Price-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images-e1435092696571.jpg" alt="Mark Price attempts to dribble around Rick Fox" width="757" height="556" /></a> JEFF HAYNES/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Throw Percentage</span>: 90.39%</li>
</ul>
Mark Price may be attempting to drive around the defender in the above picture, but we wouldn’t be surprised if his true intention was to draw some contact. After all, if you sent this guy to the free throw line he was more than likely going to knock down some shots. In his 12-year career, Price led the NBA in free throw percentage three times, including the 1992-93 season when he made <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pricema01.html" target="_blank">289 out of 305 attempts</a>. Just a measly 94.8%. Up until this past year, Price had been sitting pretty at the top of this list. It would’ve had to take a pretty special shooter to knock him off his perch. And that’s exactly what happened.

<h2>1. Steve Nash</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715940" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/185696357-e1414158278401.jpg"><img class="wp-image-715940" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/185696357-640x426.jpg" alt="Steve Nash in between plays" width="757" height="504" /></a> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Throw Percentage</span>: 90.43%</li>
</ul>
When Steve Nash <a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/12531012/steve-nash-los-angeles-lakers-announces-retirement" target="_blank">decided to retire</a> at the end of 2014-15 season, he had already cemented his legacy as one of the best points guards to ever handle the rock. After 19 seasons in the league, Nash finished third on the all-time career assists list (10,335), played in eight All-Star Games, and won two MVP awards. He was a wizard in the pick and roll, special on the fast break, and undeniably creative with the ball. And his shot was so pretty. So. Pretty. He shot <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashst01.html" target="_blank">49.0% from the field</a>, 42.8% from three-point range, and a ridiculous 90.43% from the free throw line. Who knows how long he’ll stay at the summit of the free-throw percentage mountain. But right now, it’s safe to say, that no one in the history of the NBA has done it better.

		<description><![CDATA[While there's a lot to like about the modern NBA, we think the uniforms of the past happen to be more special. Here's a look at 5 that stand the test of time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[When you play in a professional league such as the National Basketball Association, you aren’t merely attempting to put your stamp on the present, but you are also trying to create a lasting legacy. There are some unbelievable players in the league today. But there have been some great players to have come before them. How does Steph Curry stack up to the MVP’s of yore? What will LeBron James’s place in history be? These are some questions that we can’t help but ask; even as the league itself is constantly changing.

As much as we’d like to compare the current game to that of the past, we have to take into consideration that we’re living in a different era. It’s not just about the new players and organizations. It’s about the style of play, the changes in rules, and market we live in. With all these factors in play, it can, often times, feel impossible to line the past and present up side by side. However, there is one area that has changed over time that we should have no problem comparing: <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/nba_jerseys" target="_blank">jerseys</a>.

Some folks prefer an updated and modern look. Others can’t help but be prone to an old school, retro feel. Regardless of your overall taste, there can be no denying that some of the past gear was super cool. With that in mind, we’d like to pay a little tribute to the past. In our opinion, here are the five best NBA throwback jerseys ever.

[caption id="attachment_811244" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Atlanta_Hawks_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank"><img class="wp-image-811244 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Hawks_Throwback.png" alt="Hawks Throwback Jersey" width="640" height="434" /></a> Source: FansEdge[/caption]
<h2>1. Atlanta Hawks</h2>
By finishing the 2014-15 regular season with a 60-22 record — good for first place in the Eastern Conference — the Atlanta Hawks certainly exceeded expectations. And while this group may have fallen short in the postseason, it showed how to be a “team" in the truest sense of the word, and that should be commended. Another thing we dig about this current unit — and ownership — is a willingness to embrace the past; specifically through the acceptance of the totally awesome “<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/1/8699541/atlanta-hawks-new-logo-photo" target="_blank">Pac-Man logo.</a>" However, if this group really wanted to step up its game, it would pay homage to <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Atlanta_Hawks_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">Hawks’ throwback gear</a>.

It’s not that the current jerseys are terrible, it’s that they feel too rigid. We’re not a big fan of the “all caps" lettering, and the numbers look comical. And don’t get us started on the coloring — its too toned down for our taste.

However, these vintage tops are completely fresh. We love the upward diagonal lettering and numbering, the flow of the line work, and how the colors complement each other, while at the same time exuding a perfect contrast. You don’t need a flashy player like Dominique Wilkins around to really make them pop, and if you ask us, there’s simply no good reason to keep these uniforms in the past. <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Atlanta_Hawks_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">You can order one here</a>.

<h2>2. Orlando Magic</h2>
In <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/29/its-official-scott-skiles-hired-as-head-coach-of-orlando-magic/" target="_blank">hiring Scott Skiles</a> as their new head coach, the Orlando Magic are hoping that a familiar face is the right fit to lead this team into the future. It will be some time before we see whether or not this was the right decision. And yet, if this franchise was looking to draw from its past as a means of forging a positive future, it would be wise to bring back the <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Orlando_Magic_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">vintage uniforms</a>. That’s when this team was really magic.

There are many things that could be fixed with today’s Orlando gear — that atrocious neckline would be a good place to start — but this is all about how cool the throwbacks were. The font used for the numbers is sweet, and it really pops on account of the white outline. We love the straight lines throughout the whole jerseys and like how there is minimal space between each vertical stripe.

Yet, it’s the “Orlando" on the front that really makes this jersey stand out. By using a beautiful slanted font — white with a blue frame — this really feels like there’s a magical element to it. However, the real genius was using a star in place of the “A" in “Orlando." Our eyes can’t help but be drawn to it. And really, isn’t that the point? <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Orlando_Magic_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">The throwbacks are available here</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>3. Phoenix Suns</h2>
Some folks are fans of the <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Phoenix_Suns_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">retro Phoenix Suns jerseys</a> and others simply don’t get it. As you can see, we fall in the former category. Today’s uniforms are certainly more current, but they lack the pizzazz of Phoenix’s swag of yore. We don’t particularly like use of the V-neck, and we can’t stand the accented look of the shoulders. But what really frustrates us, is the half-streak right before the numbering. If you compare this to the past tops, it’s no contest. The throwbacks are in a league of their own.

We are all about the Sun. We enjoyed when this franchise made that symbol a focal point of its uniforms. By turning the basketball into the star that stands at the center of everything, Phoenix was making a strong point. This organization is, and always will be, about basketball. Perhaps we’re waxing poetic a bit too much here, but we can’t help it. And if the Sun doesn’t work for you, then we hope you at least appreciate the orange and purple around the neck and sleeveless sections. That’s some crisp use of color, and you can <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Phoenix_Suns_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">add it to your wardrobe by ordering a jersey here</a>.

&nbsp;
<h2>4. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
The modern day Philadelphia 76ers don’t perform at the same level as teams of the past, but at least this franchise seems to have an idea on how to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-sixers-reinvented-their-basketball-identity.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">reinvent its identity</a>. And while this group accepts losing as a means of eventually finding success, it has looked to the past to fix one significant faux pas: its jersey.

The current Sixers top does feel a bit “boxey." But what we find so appealing is the simplicity of the present look. There’s no need to go over the top with the design. Philadelphia is drawing attention to the bold use of red, white, and blue, and we think that’s a smart move.

Of course, if it were up to us, we’d try and <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Philadelphia_76ers_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">resemble the throwback</a> a bit more. These jerseys really took to heart the notion that “less is more." And it absolutely works. We usually don’t like the V-neck as much, but because the Sixers are using a deep-V, we can let it slide. <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Philadelphia_76ers_Throwback_Jersey/adidas_Julius_Erving_Philadelphia_76ers_White_Hardwood_Classics_Swingman_Jersey" target="_blank">This jersey</a> — and its <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Philadelphia_76ers_Throwback_Jersey/adidas_Philadelphia_76ers_Julius_Erving_Red_Hardwood_Classics_Soul_Swingman_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">red counterpart</a> — are beautifully simplistic. The letters and numbering are extremely minimalist, and yet, the red outlines are a graceful touch. We think the three stripes surrounding the neck and sleeveless areas are a smart choose and provide an extra element to this top. When we look at this jersey, we can’t help but be transported to a time when the focus was merely on the game itself. And if that doesn’t get you sentimental, perhaps this will. That’s right. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr0vwEEbTf4" target="_blank">The Doctor is in</a>.

<h2>5. Portland Trail Blazers</h2>
The Portland Trail Blazers, in our opinion, have set the standard for top-notch uniforms. Even today, this organization has <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Portland_Trail_Blazers_Jerseys" target="_blank">remained fairly true</a> to the gear of yesteryear. And if we’re being completely honest, this franchise has the coolest-looking <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-nba-teams-with-perfect-christmas-day-jerseys.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Christmas Day uniforms</a> in the entire NBA. Yet, even with all the quality gear this team has, we completely miss <a href="http://www.fansedge.com/Portland_Trail_Blazers_Throwback_Jersey" target="_blank">Portland’s older jerseys</a>. Those throwbacks were fantastic.

The accented white area around the neckline (and sleeveless section) immediately draws you in and force you to take notice of the whole top. That’s a good thing because this jersey is worth paying attention to. Not only is the red numbering and lettering a glorious choice, but absolutely LOVE how the “blazers" name is entirely lower case. If there was nothing else to focus on but the lower-cased bold print, it would still be enough. Sometimes organizations simply get it. It’s clear the Portland Trail Blazers are among the selective few.

		<description><![CDATA[It's never too early to look at the best teams in the league, even if the 2015 NBA season won't start until the fall.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The NBA offseason is quickly approaching training camp reporting and chatter, with the draft, summer league, and various free agent signings, now largely on the books. For fans of almost every franchise, hope abounds at this point in the news cycle, whether it’s coming from hot shot rookies, grizzled veterans, new head coaches, or team executives saying all the right things.

Still, only a few select teams will emerge to have a real chance at championship glory, by midseason. The elite teams, eyes squarely locked on the postseason, have already locked veteran personnel into fair contracts, while also laying the groundwork for young prospects to step up in crunch time.
<h2>5. Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703856" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703856" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/490253775-e1411759748969.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="537" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

&nbsp;

Barring injury, the Oklahoma City Thunder,will quickly emerge as a not-quite dark horse candidate for the 2016 Finals. Last season, a hurt Kevin Durant managed to average 25 points through 27 games, before being shut down, and shortly thereafter, Serge Ibaka took time off to recouperate from a surgery that repaired damage in his knee. This set the stage for Russell Westbrook to take over. And take over he did, blitzing the competition for 28 points, seven rebounds, nine assists, and two steals per game.

However, the Thunder closed out the regular season at 45-37, one game out of the playoffs. This offseason, the Thunder went on to replace head coach Scott Brooks with Billy Donovan, before signing Enes Kanter to a four-year, $70 million deal. Kanter underwent something of a renaissance last season, to put up 19 and 11, after being packaged within a three-team deal that brought him to OKC from Utah and shipped Reggie Jackson off to Detroit.

For next season, an Oklahoma City core featuring Durant, Westbrook, Ibaka, and Kanter will fill it up against anybody. On the other end, Ibaka will patrol work to control the glass and clean up after his teammates. Kanter is still a turnstile defensively, and the Thunder may need another piece to shore up a weak bench. Still, these issues will likely not be a major factor during the regular season.

<h2>4. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_810289" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-810289 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LeBron-James-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-e1433778444942.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="534" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The star-crossed city of Cleveland was left to wonder what might have been after the Cavaliers lost the NBA Finals in six games, as Anderson Verejao, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving watched from the bench. Even In defeat, LeBron James earned some consideration for (or at least inspired serious conversations about) Finals MVP, after averaging 36 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists per game stat line.

This offseason, the Cavs have already signed Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, and LeBron James to deals worth a combined $280 million. Cleveland will likely bring back J.R. Smith for less money, after the mercurial guard declined his player option, for $6 million. For added wing depth, Richard Jefferson has also agreed to terms with Cleveland, for a one-year contract, at the veteran’s minimum.

The Cavaliers will be deep into the luxury tax in its two-pronged and sometimes contradictory attempt to sate King James and win now. In hoping to keep James happy, team executives have thrown tens of millions of dollars at “LeBron’s guys,” instead of building through the draft and developing young talent. This year, the Cavs drafted Tyus Jones out of Duke, only to immediately ship the young point guard out to Minnesota in exchange for two second round picks to free up cash.

As is, Cleveland will likely make quick work out of a still-weak East, before running slam into a brick wall of an opponent in the Finals. The team still lacks a third playmaker – to flank LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, especially after James showed signs of running out of gas late last season, after carrying the full load against swarming defenses, night after night.

<h2>3. Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_822601" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-822601 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Blake-Griffin-and-DeAndre-Jordan-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images-e1436444698870.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 10: DeAndre Jordan #6 (R) and Blake Griffin #32 of the Los Angeles Clippers celebrate from the bench as they sit out the closing minutes of the fourth quarter against the Houston Rockets during Game Four of the Western Conference semifinals of the 2015 NBA Playoffs at Staples Center on May 10, 2015 in Los Angeles, California.

&nbsp;

The Clippers salvaged their offseason (DeAndre Jordan-Gate, if you will) and brought in some much needed bench depth — Paul Pierce, Lance Stephenson, and Josh Smith. These new additions will help the Clippers to match up well against in-state rival Golden State and its high-octane “small ball” lineups.

All L.A. Clipper wings will feed off the energy of Lob City, with Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan, and Blake Griffin starring as the primary ringleaders for this high wire act. The Clippers are especially dangerous off the pick-and-roll, where Chris Paul is left free to either knock down a mid-range jump shot or hit DeAndre Jordan in stride for a hammer dunk. With both options covered, CP3 has both Blake Griffin and sharpshooter J.J. Redick flashing towards the basket and lurking behind the arc to bust up defenses.

Next season, the Clippers will be out to finally make the Western Conference Finals after blowing their Semifinal series against the Rockets, despite racing out to a 3-1 series advantage against  Houston, including giving up a 19-point Game Six lead, before being run off the floor in Houston during the close out game.

<h2>2. San Antonio Spurs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716930" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716930" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Parker-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="HOUSTON, TX - OCTOBER 24:  Tony Parker #9 of the San Antonio Spurs waits on the court at the start of their preseason game against the Houston Rockets at Toyota Center on October 24, 2014 in Houston, Texas NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and/or using this photograph, user is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. Mandatory copyright notice:  (Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images)" width="757" height="526" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Spurs are looking to avenge their opening round loss to the Clippers, and to keep the machine running, the Spurs signed marquee free agent LaMarcus Aldridge this offseason, before also agreeing to terms with Kawhi Leonard, Manu Ginobili, and Tim Duncan. Against this backdrop, former All-Star David West left millions of dollars on the table to sign for the veteran’s minimum and chase after his first ring with Greg Popovich and company.

Tim Duncan, of course, remains the heart and soul of the San Antonio Spurs. At 38, Old Man Riverwalk still has plenty left in the tank, and often beats younger competition down the floor, right to the front of the rim. The Spurs may have lost that series, but Duncan more than held his own against Blake Griffin through the first round of the playoffs.
<h2>1. Golden State Warriors</h2>
The road to the 2016 NBA Finals still runs through Oakland until the playoffs prove otherwise. The Warriors, of course, are coming off a dream season, where they raced out to a 67-15 regular season record, avoided debilitating injuries, and made relatively quick work out of the playoff field. Stephen Curry also took home the MVP award, almost by default — “just" by being the best player on the best team in the league.

With the exception of David Lee, the Warriors will largely keep their championship unit intact heading into 2016. Parting ways with Lee may even be considered a net positive, as the move clears up a frontcourt logjam between Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli, and Draymond Green.

Golden State, with its abundance of riches, could even afford to bring Finals MVP Andre Iguodala off the bench last season. Steve Kerr and the Warriors have literally revolutionized the game of basketball, in refusing to shoehorn players into rigidly defined roles. Next year, the Warriors will likely be at it again, with Iguodala playing lockdown defense, Green crashing the boards, Klay Thompson spotting up behind the arc, and Stephen “Chef” Curry cooking up points, in bunches.

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of NBA players have their own signature shoes, but some of these kicks are more popular than others. Which player's sneakers sold the most in 2014?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_737651" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-737651" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jordan-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="529" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

It takes a lot for an <a href="http://www.nba.com/" target="_blank">NBA</a> player to warrant his own signature shoe. Not only do athletes have to be incredibly skilled, but a major apparel company needs to believe that their popularity will be enough to help them push the most amount of product. It’s one thing to be a superstar on the basketball court, but it’s a whole different story to become a brand off it.

With enough talent in the NBA, it’s no surprise that a lot of money was made from the sales of signature sneakers last year. However, according to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, there were certain players whose kicks did better in the United States than others. Based on the 2014 sales of their signature shoes, here are the NBA’s top five shoe salesmen.

<h2>5. Chris Paul, Derrick Rose [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_729141" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-729141" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chris-Paul-Ethan-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /> Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signature shoe sales in 2014</span>: $32 million</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.nba.com/clippers/" target="_blank">Los Angeles Clipper</a> <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01.html" target="_blank">Chris Paul</a> (pictured) is probably the most fundamentally sound point guard in the NBA. CP3 is the perfect floor general. He doesn’t just break down a defense down with his handle — more often than not, he uses his intelligence to control the game. And while he’s tormenting opponents on the basketball court, he’s doing it in his <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/chris-paul-jordan/b8uZc8d" target="_blank">Jordan Brand</a> kicks. His shoes may not be the top seller on the market, but we’re sure that <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" target="_blank">Nike</a> isn’t complaining about the $32 million he’s helped send its way.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3456/derrick-rose" target="_blank">Derrick Rose</a> was supposed to be the man for <a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/" target="_blank">Adidas</a>. The company believed so much in this <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/" target="_blank">Chicago Bull’s marketability</a> that in 2010, right when he won the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/nba-mvp-award-winners/" target="_blank">MVP award</a>, they signed him to a lucrative <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/bulls/derrick-rose-one-10-highest-earning-athletes-2014-0" target="_blank">13-year, $185 million deal</a>. However, due to Rose’s continuous injuries, Adidas has not been getting the return on investment that it had hoped for. Even though D-Rose’s signature sneakers brought in $32 million for the company in 2014, this total was <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/18/lebron-james-is-nbas-top-shoe-salesman-with-340-million-for-nike-in-2014/" target="_blank">down 20% from the previous year</a>.

<h2>3. Kobe Bryant</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signature shoe sales in 2014</span>: $105 million</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> comes in at third on the list, with his signature kicks pulling in $105 million for Nike. While Bryant has always been an extremely popular figure in China, his sneaker sales in the United States have shown considerable growth in the past year. By <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/18/lebron-james-is-nbas-top-shoe-salesman-with-340-million-for-nike-in-2014/" target="_blank">more than doubling his numbers</a> ($50 million) from the previous year, Bryant has made the biggest gains out of any NBA player with a signature sneaker. Not bad for the Black Mamba. It’s a shame his <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers" target="_blank">Los Angeles Lakers</a> aren’t making the same kind of strides.

<h2>2. Kevin Durant</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signature shoe sales in 2014</span>: $195 million</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html" target="_blank">Kevin Durant’s monster</a> <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2014.html" target="_blank">2013-2014 season</a> did more than just bring him his <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/nba-mvp-award-winners/" target="_blank">first MVP award</a> award it also continued to increase his overall popularity. In 2014, KD’s signature shoes racked up sales of $195 million, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/18/lebron-james-is-nbas-top-shoe-salesman-with-340-million-for-nike-in-2014/" target="_blank">up 11% from the previous year</a> However, this increase does not compare to the 400% rise that Durant made in 2013. Still, Durant is such mega-superstar that Nike had no problem giving him a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nike-outbids-under-armour-for-kevin-durant-2014-9" target="_blank">10-year contract extension</a> that could be worth up to $300 million. Whether Durant chooses to stay with the <a href="http://www.nba.com/thunder/" target="_blank">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> when he <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/07/15/report-if-kevin-durant-leaves-thunder-as-free-agent-hed-probably-sign-with-wizards/" target="_blank">hits free agency in 2016</a>, or if he can make a full recovery after spending much of last season sidelined with injury, is anybody’s guess. But it’s safe to assume that he’ll remain part of the Nike family for years to come.

	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Signature shoe sales in 2014</span>: $340 million</li>
</ul>
There is only one king, and that title belongs to <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html" target="_blank">LeBron James</a>. In 2014, his signature sneakers brought in <a href="http://www.nba.com/thunder/" target="_blank">$340 million for Nike</a>, nearly doubling Durant’s total in the process. He is one of the biggest athletes on the planet, and, as you can see, the numbers back that up. This past year, his sales were up 13%, and it also helps that James has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/03/18/lebron-james-is-nbas-top-shoe-salesman-with-340-million-for-nike-in-2014/" target="_blank">12 signature shoes</a> to his name. LeBron may have returned to play for the <a href="http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/" target="_blank">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> this season, but it’s clear that his reach far exceeds the state of Ohio. Reign on, LeBron. Reign on.

LeBron versus Jordan — is this kicking a dead horse? Two of the game’s indisputable greats, playing in quick succession, being compared over two decidedly different eras of NBA basketball, and the one that is better is largely determined by which one you prefer, right? Wrong. While we’d never feel 100% comfortable making the claim that Jordan wasn’t the greatest player of all time (thanks, Nike), there’s some evidence that LeBron has, at this point in his career, been a more singular force than His Airness. Take a breath before you keep reading.

When Jordan was 30 years old, he was in the middle of his ninth NBA season, the 1992-1993 year that would see Chicago take home their third straight NBA championship. When LeBron James was 30 years old, he was set to face the Golden State Warriors in his fifth straight NBA Finals appearance, a culmination to his 13th season playing basketball at the highest level. Statistically, the two players <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/xrz7k" target="_blank">are largely a wash</a>, with Jordan holding an edge in shooting and James holding a slight edge everywhere else. It’s worth noting that James has outpaced MJ in raw numbers, but that’s to be expected when you consider that LeBron has logged nearly 10,000 more minutes of regular season play than Jordan had at that same age: a byproduct of going straight to the pros rather than playing in college.

So, if the numbers are subject to variables that make them suspect, we should look at accomplishments, right? To writ, LeBron has four regular MVP awards (and you could make a strong argument that he missed out on another four because of voter fatigue — either way, there’s little doubt that he’s been the best player in the league every year he hasn’t won the award), two Finals MVP nods, a metric ton of All-Star appearances, All-NBA,  and All-Defensive nods. He has been to the Finals five times and has a pair of rings to show for it. What did Jordan have at 30?

Interestingly enough, Jordan’s 30th birthday coincided almost exactly with the second era of his play — it was February 17th, 1993, or right near the midpoint of the last season he’d play in the league before taking a year off to pursue his passion for minor league baseball. To that point, Jordan would amass three MVP nods, a comparable number of All-Star and other All- awards, in addition to three rings: three rings in three tries, and never needing a Game 7 to finish off a series on the NBA’s biggest stage. For many Jordan fans, this is the most enduring fact. The man did not lose when it counted. That he was an insane competitor hiding behind the game’s greatest marketing machine of his time only adds to this legend.

This cuts both ways. We can’t imagine Bill Laimbeer is<a href="http://www.foxsports.com/detroit/story/laimbeer-says-no-question-he-d-take-lebron-james-over-jordan-052815" target="_blank"> coming from an objective place</a> when he says that he’d take LeBron “no question" over Jordan, even if his point, that “[t]he triple threat that [LeBron] poses is just phenomenal, and then the size that he’s got,he just physically dominates" is valid. For every people who laced up Nikes wanting to be like Mike, there are people who will forever think MJ is overrated: the guy that made superstar rules the norm, rather than the exception.  This is heresy to the conventional narrative, where referees are impartial and Jordan was basically God in high tops (he is, by the way), but its worth noting that MJ was universally lauded in a way that LeBron never was. Call it the Internet’s influence, but to this point LeBron might have had a better career than His Airness, and none of us are ever going to admit it.

		<description><![CDATA[With the Hawks up for sale after racist comments, Dominique Wilkins could become the latest celebrity to own an NBA team.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_699443" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-699443 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Wilkins-Neilson-Barnard-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Neilson Barnard/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the rare silver linings to <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/atlanta-hawks-owner-leaks-his-own-racially-charged-emails-leaves-nba.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">the Atlanta Hawks saga</a> was the opportunity for new, less racially charged team ownership to enter into the NBA. In case you missed it, the majority owner of the Hawks, Bruce Levenson, leaked some of his own emails where he openly discussed ways to bring in the key demographic for season ticket sales in the NBA — namely, middle aged white people and corporations — by making the game experience less black. Seriously, you can read the full email <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/atlanta-hawks-bruce-levenson-full-email" target="_blank">here</a>. This was compounded when GM Danny Ferry was caught reading <a href="http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/news/documents/2014/09/12/LuolDeng.pdf" target="_blank">a scouting report</a> of Luol Deng that said Deng had “a bit of African in him.” Ferry’s been suspended from the team indefinitely.

So, bad things were afoot for the Atlanta Hawks — at least as far as the management and front office are concerned. While it didn't come to pass (the team <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/hawks-sold-new-owners-850-million-article-1.2195597" target="_blank">was sold to an ownership group that included Grant Hill in April</a>), one of the most exciting  rumors was the idea that the team was potentially looking to move the Human Highlight Film further up the ownership ladder. Dominique Wilkins, who spent his most impressive NBA years with the Hawks, was already the team’s vice president and a color commentator, told <em>ESPN</em> that he’d “absolutely” be interested in moving up in the ranks some more.

While ‘Nique did not wind up transitioning into an ownership role with Atlanta, Grant Hill became the sixth celebrity owner to join the league, not counting Magic Johnson, who was briefly an owner of the Los Angeles Lakers. Read on to see the other five.

<h2>5. Shaq, Sacramento Kings</h2>
If you remember Shaq’s run as the pillar of the Los Angeles Laker’s threepeat at the turn of the century, then you remember Shaq owning the Sacramento Kings on the floor, especially in the contentious (and potentially referee-assisted) 2002 Western Conference Finals. That was the context for about a billion jokes in September of 2013 when O’Neal became a minority owner of the Kings in the wake of the Maloof saga’s resolution. In case you missed that: the Kings were very close to being purchased by an ownership group that would have moved them to Seattle, resurrecting the SuperSonics, because the former owners refused to negotiate with any prospective buyers in Sacramento. It was yucky, and eventually the NBA had to step in on behalf of the city in order to keep the team in California’s capital.

There is nothing good about the pun Shaqramento Kings, though. We’re glad that didn’t catch on beyond <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/9716271/shaquille-oneal-talks-role-new-owner-sacramento-kings" target="_blank">this <em>ESPN </em>report</a>.
<h2>4. Michael Jordan, Charlotte Hornets</h2>
The first former NBA player to successfully become a majority owner of a franchise, Jordan started his involvement with the Hornets back when they were still called the Bobcats. Although he had tried to become a part owner during the last waning years of the original Hornets franchise (now in New Orleans, and now called the Pelicans), His Airness was unable to gain a foothold until he nabbed a minority share of the new team in 2005, assuming full ownership in 2010.

<h2>3. Peyton Manning, Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
When the Memphis Grizzlies were sold in 2012, the ownership group (helmed by Robert Pera, who <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2014/05/26/memphis-grizzlies-dave-joerger-robert-pera" target="_blank">has some crazy ideas</a> about how to run a team) was first reported to include Manning’s wife, Ashley, and not Manning himself, who <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21699556/peyton-manning-wife-ashley-buy-stake-nbas-memphis" target="_blank">said at the time</a> that, “<span id="redesign_default"><span id="MNGiSection">I am proud of Ashley as she pursues this opportunity with the Memphis Grizzlies. While my focus is on playing quarterback for the Denver Broncos, I look forward to watching her become involved with her hometown team.” By the time the pen went to the paper, though, the Denver quarterback had, indeed, signed on as a limited owner — as had one-time NBA All-Star Penny Hardaway, another Memphis native. That’s before we mention the other big name involved in the Memphis purchase — the number two on this list.</span></span>
<h2>2. Justin Timberlake, Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
As an A-list celebrity, Timberlake’s presence in the NBA — even (or especially) as a limited partner in a small market team like Memphis — brings a lot of visibility to the league. While he’s probably not as heavily identified with the Grizz as Jay-Z was with the Nets, his appearances on the sideline during the playoffs, and occasionally the regular season, help bring a little more spotlight onto one of the more traditionally ignored franchises.

<h2>1. Will Smith, Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
“Larry Bird ruined my childhood.” That was how Will Smith — actor, rapper, and West Philadelphia native (that’s right, born and raised) — celebrated Doug Collins’ 400th win, which came over the Boston Celtics. Smith has existed in the upper stratosphere of celebrity since bursting into the world’s awareness with <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em> and roughly a million blockbuster movies. With accompanying soundtracks and singles, natch, he is, far and away, the most famous of the NBA owners.

Smith first bought into the 76ers in 2011 when the franchise sold for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2011/07/14/comcast-spectacor-sells-philadelphia-76ers-for-under-300-million/" target="_blank">just under $300 million</a>, or less than one sixth of what the Clippers would sell for three years later.

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James is heading back to the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive year. What are we to make of this latest accomplishment?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_806020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lebron-james2-e1432759517196.jpg"><img class="wp-image-806020 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lebron-james2-e1432759517196.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>When <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> told the world he was <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers" target="_blank">coming home</a> to once again play for the Cavaliers, he was desperate to bring the city of Cleveland a championship. But he also stressed patience. He understood the hard work, sacrifice, and focus required to reach the pinnacle of the National Basketball Association.</p>
<p>Unlike his future teammates, James had been there before: &#8220;I’m going into a situation with a young team and a new coach. I will be the old head. But I get a thrill out of bringing a group together and helping them reach a place they didn’t know they could go." And that&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s done with this latest playoff run.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers organization is heading back to the <a href="http://www.nba.com/2015/news/05/26/nba-finals-schedule/" target="_blank">NBA Finals</a> for the first time since 2007. But for the majority of this group, the upcoming matchup with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400796359" target="_blank">recently-crowned Western Conference champion</a> Golden State Warriors will be its first foray into the season&#8217;s final showdown. Fortunately, should anyone on this team need any advice on what it&#8217;s like to play in the NBA Finals, they know exactly who to turn to. After all, this will be James&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/603396316274806784" target="_blank">fifth consecutive trip</a> to the game&#8217;s biggest stage.</p>
<p>In this day and age, it doesn&#8217;t seem possible that a player could reach that many NBA Finals in a row. But here&#8217;s the King, heading into the spotlight for the for a fifth year in a row, trying to capture the third ring of his career. We didn&#8217;t think he could do anything else to impress us further than he already has. Of course, perhaps we just forgot who we were talking about.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_806011" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lebron-james-and-bill-russell-e1432758820289.jpg"><img class="wp-image-806011 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lebron-james-and-bill-russell-e1432758820289.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="522" /></a> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>With this latest accomplishment, James joins an exclusive club. In the history of the NBA, only <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/603396316274806784" target="_blank">eight players</a> &#8212; <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/russebi01.html" target="_blank">Bill Russell</a> (10), K.C. Jones (8), Sam Jones (9), Bob Cousy (7), Tom Heinsohn (9), Bill Sharman (5), Frank Ramsey (8), Tom Sanders (6) &#8212;  had ever played in five straight NBA Finals. With James crashing the party, this group has its first new member <a href="https://twitter.com/nbastats/status/603407627138297857" target="_blank">since 1966</a>. But there is something else that distinguishes &#8216;Bron from this other crop. And it is something that cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>The previous eight members did go to at least five straight finals, but they were fortunate enough to be part of those sensational Boston Celtics teams of the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s. James, obviously, didn&#8217;t have that luxury. Somehow, though, he&#8217;s managed to make it to five consecutive finals as a member of three separate teams. No one has ever done that. Not only that, James put up numbers in the Eastern Conference finals &#8212; <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2015_ECF_CLE-ATL.html" target="_blank">30.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 9.3 assists</a> &#8212; that, <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasSports/status/603543600769667072" target="_blank">according to Elias Sports Bureau</a>, were totally unprecedented. And to do it with this team &#8212; for this city &#8212; makes it all the more impressive.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;d forgotten, it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that no one wanted to join the King in Cleveland. <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/lebron-james--long-trip-home-to-lead-the-cavaliers-back-to-the-nba-finals-062325094.html" target="_blank">Said James back in October</a>: &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t win nothing so nobody wanted to come with me. I recruited. I recruited Michael Redd. I recruited Joe Johnson. I recruited Chris Bosh. I recruited a lot of guys. I just didn&#8217;t win. They didn&#8217;t want to come to Cleveland." It&#8217;s funny how things work out. James eventually had to leave, in order to be able to return and lead. And he&#8217;s better for it.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_806016" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LeBron-James_All-In-e1432759281535.jpg"><img class="wp-image-806016 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/LeBron-James_All-In-e1432759281535.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>This may be James&#8217; fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, but there&#8217;s something different about this most recent one. &#8220;It&#8217;s very emotional to get back in this setting," said James. &#8220;I knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy. I knew it was going to take a lot of hard work and dedication. The toughest task for me was trying to get this team back to the Finals." Now that he&#8217;s managed to do that, things are about to get even tougher.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors will be the best team the Cavaliers have faced all postseason. They&#8217;re dominant on the offensive and defensive ends of the floors. They have MVP <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a> and fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson, who can light things up from the outside like no other. They are extremely deep and coached as well as any team in the NBA. But there is, in fact, one thing the best from the West in lacking: Experience.</p>
<p>With James leading the charge, the Cavaliers have the ultimate tour guide to the NBA Finals. This group now has a chance to bring the city of Cleveland its first championship since 1951. We have no idea how things will turn out. But there is one thing we do know. The Cleveland Cavaliers are &#8220;All In." And that&#8217;s exactly what LeBron James was hoping for.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As the saying goes, "Defense wins championships." In the NBA, this phrase certainly rings true. Here are 5 players who take defense to the next level.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not everyone can be a dominant scorer. But if you can play high-quality defense, there’s a place for you in the NBA. Defensive stoppers don’t necessarily get the fame or fortune, but they are a vital part of the success of any NBA franchise. A big stop during a tight game can turn the tides in that team’s favor. And that’s why those who contribute on this end of the floor will always be sought after.

So, in our humble opinion, here are the five best defenders in the NBA.

&nbsp;

<h2>1. Tony Allen, shooting guard, Memphis Grizzlies</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NBA defensive accolades</span>:
<ul>
	<li>All-Defensive First Team, 2012-2013</li>
	<li>All-Defensive Second Team, 2011</li>
</ul>
While there are a lot of valuable pieces that make up a successful NBA franchise, one of the most overlooked roles is the perimeter defender. Luckily for the Memphis Grizzlies, they have theirs in <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2367/tony-allen" target="_blank">Tony Allen</a>, who is arguably the best on-ball defender in the league. Allen may be 6-foot-4, but his wingspan is actually closer to 6-foot-9. This length, along with his quick hands and feet, make him more than capable of D-ing up even the best scorers in the NBA. Just ask <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20141125/lakers-kobe-bryant-considers-memphis-tony-allen-best-defender" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a>.

<h2>2. Joakim Noah, center, Chicago Bulls</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NBA defensive accolades</span>:
<ul>
	<li>Defensive Player of the Year, 2014</li>
	<li>All-Defensive First Team, 2013-2014</li>
	<li>All-Defensive Second Team, 2011</li>
</ul>
The energetic center out of the University of Florida plays the game with a contagious ferocity. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/noahjo01.html" target="_blank">Joakim Noah</a> is a force on the defensive end because of his energy, footwork, length, and timing. He is the defensive anchor of a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank">Chicago Bulls</a> squad that, under coach Tom Thibodeau, is among the stingiest teams in the league. Last season, Noah had a career high in rebounds (11.3 per game) and made his money on the defensive end. This, along with his undeniably high motor, helped him earn the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award that year.

<h2>3. Serge Ibaka, power forward, Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NBA defensive accolades</span>:
<ul>
	<li>All-Defensive First Team, 2012-2014</li>
</ul>
The Oklahoma City Thunder are an entirely different team when <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/i/ibakase01.html" target="_blank">Serge Ibaka</a> is on the floor. The 25-year-old out of the Republic of the Congo has the ability to completely alter a game defensively. He has a massive, athletic body at 6-foot-10 and 220 pounds, and an affinity for blocking shots. It is in this category that he most imposes his will on the rest of the league, having led the NBA the past two seasons. If you plan on driving to the hole against the Thunder, make sure you account for the presence of Ibaka. Unless, of course, you want your shot swatted into the stands.

<h2>4. LeBron James, small forward, Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NBA defensive accolades</span>:
<ul>
	<li>All-Defensive First Team, 2009-2013</li>
	<li>All-Defensive Second Team, 2014</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> is the best two-way player in the NBA. His size and control over his own body allow him to not only guard every position on the floor but guard every position effectively. His basketball IQ is off the charts, and his vision on the floor ranks among the best this game has ever seen. While his defense might not be the first thing to pop into your head when you think about LeBron, the league has certainly taken notice by awarding him first-team honors for five straight years, from 2009 to 2013, and second-team last year. Still, if you need a reminder of how talented he is, check out the below “chasedown" highlight reel.

<h2>5. Chris Paul, point guard, Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NBA defensive accolades</span>:
<ul>
	<li>All-Defensive First Team, 2009, 2012-2014</li>
	<li>All-Defensive Second Team, 2008, 2011</li>
</ul>
Don’t let his stature fool you: <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2779/chris-paul" target="_blank">Chris Paul</a> isn’t intimidated by anyone. This All-Star point guard from <a href="http://www.wakeforestsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/wake-m-baskbl-body.html" target="_blank">Wake Forest</a> will get in your face, relentlessly hound you, and force you to turn over the rock. He is among the most physical players in the NBA, and his tenacity extends to the defensive end of the floor. Not only is considered one of the best floor generals in the league, but CP3 has been a member of the All-Defensive Team six times in his career. But of luck trying to bring the ball up against him.

		<description><![CDATA[On Sunday night, the Golden State Warriors overcame a 26-point deficit to beat the Boston Celtics. How does this impressive comeback compare to the best ever?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_729124" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-729124 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Steph-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="640" height="447" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>On Sunday night, the <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> found themselves <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400579172" target="_blank">down by 26 points</a> on the road against the <a href="http://www.nba.com/celtics/" target="_blank">Boston Celtics</a>. It didn&#8217;t seem like the odds were good for the league&#8217;s best team. But if we&#8217;ve learned anything, it&#8217;s that you can never count out the Warriors.</p>
<p>Led by 37 points from superstar <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a>, Golden State overcame this massive deficit to <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/gameday/20150301/recap" target="_blank">pull off a thrilling 106-101 comeback victory</a>. In doing so, the Warriors showcased the type of resolve that you need if you&#8217;re going to contend for an NBA championship. We already knew that this Western Conference power was talented, but now we know they have the ability to dig themselves out of a major hole if they need to. But despite how impressive this come-from-behind performance was, where does it stand among the best ever?</p>
<p>With that, here are the three greatest comebacks in NBA history.</p>

<h2>3. Utah Jazz vs. Chicago Bulls</h2>
<p>Date: February 4, 1998<br />
Final Score: 101-93<br />
Points overcome: 31</p>
<p>On this night in the <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/seasonreviews/1997-98/" target="_blank">1997-98 NBA Season</a>, the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls" target="_blank">Chicago Bulls</a> would visit the <a href="http://www.nba.com/jazz/" target="_blank">Utah Jazz</a> in what would turn out to be an NBA Finals preview. While we all know how that series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyL0FxS-F6E" target="_blank">turned out</a>, this game ended up going the Jazz&#8217;s way. But they had to earn it.</p>
<p>Despite being at the Delta Center, Utah found themselves in quite the hole. Not only were they down by 22 points after the first quarter, but that deficit would increase to as high as 31. But there was no quit in the Jazz. They would scrape and claw their way back into the ball game, and outscore Chicago in the final three periods. Even with <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> dropping 40 points on the night, Utah would get 30 from superstar <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html" target="_blank">Karl Malone</a> and an additional 17 points from <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/stockjo01.html" target="_blank">John Stockton</a>, on their way to an impressive <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199802040UTA.html" target="_blank">101-93 victory</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Sacramento Kings vs. Chicago Bulls</h2>
<p>Date: December 21, 2009<br />
Final Score: 102-98<br />
Points overcome: 35</p>
<p>For most of the night, this game was all Chicago. The Bulls were completely dominating the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/sac/sacramento-kings" target="_blank">Sacramento Kings</a> at the United Center. They doubled up the Kings in the first quarter, and had a commanding 67-43 lead at the break. The lead would grow to 35 points in the third quarter, but that&#8217;s the most it would get. After that, it was all Sacramento.</p>
<p>Led by <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansty01.html" target="_blank">Tyreke Evan</a>&#8216;s team-high 23 points, the Kings blitzkrieged the Bulls in the second half and would outscore them by 23 points in the fourth quarter. Despite 26 points from Luol Deng and 24 from Derrick Rose, Chicago was unable to hold off the furious Sacramento comeback. When the final buzzer sounded, it was the away team who would come out on top by a final score of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200912210CHI.html" target="_blank">102-98</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets</h2>
<p>Date: November 27, 1996<br />
Final Score: 107-103<br />
Points overcome: 36</p>
<p>The greatest comeback in NBA history once again involved the Utah Jazz, and they also did it in front of their home crowd at the Delta Center. Although Utah was riding a seven-game winning streak, that did not stop them from coming out sluggish against the <a href="http://www.nba.com/nuggets/" target="_blank">Denver Nuggets</a>. The Jazz gave up 70 points in the first half, and found themselves in a 34-point hole. This lead would increase to 36 in the third quarter, and it appeared that all hope was lost of extending the streak to eight games. And then the momentum swung in Utah&#8217;s favor.</p>
<p>The second half ended up being all Utah, as they managed to slowly get back into the game. The Jazz would outscore the Nuggets 36-15 in the third quarter, and 35-18 in the fourth. Karl Malone would drop 31 points on the night, and sharpshooter <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hornaje01.html" target="_blank">Jeff Hornacek</a> would contribute 29 of his own. The Jazz had the Nuggets on the ropes. And they knew it. They would finish this monumental comeback by a final score of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/evansty01.html" target="_blank">107-103</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Golden State Warriors just won their 17th consecutive game on their home floor. How does this compare to the best home-court streaks of all time?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_745152" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-745152 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Steph-Curry-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x412.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="640" height="412" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry" target="_blank">Steph Curry</a> and the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/gs/golden-state-warriors" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> continued to state their case for the best team in the NBA last night, as they smoked the Houston Rockets, <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400578928" target="_blank">126-113</a>. This win not only gave the Warriors a league best 34-6 record, but also reinforced their dominance on their home floor. The victory was their 17th-straight at ORACLE Arena, setting a new franchise record for home-wins in a row. That&#8217;s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Not only are the Golden State Warriors proving how talented they are, but they&#8217;re also showing how difficult it will be to beat them in the playoffs should they get home-court throughout. This is exactly the kind of edge that helps teams win a championship. And, with a 19-1 record at home, things are looking good for the Warriors.</p>
<p>While 17 straight is a solid streak, the Warriors are going to have to keep it up if they want to reach the same level as the best home team streaks of all time. With that, let&#8217;s take a look at the top 7 home game winning streaks in NBA history.</p>

<h4>7. Chicago Bulls</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 32 games</p>
<p>From December 11, 1996 until April 14, 1997, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1997.html" target="_blank">1996-97 Chicago Bulls</a> could not be beaten at the United Center. <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> was an absolute machine during this span. During the season, MJ averaged 29.6 points-per-game, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists. This was a sensational group of players, who ended up repeating the season as champions.</p>
<p>However, at 32-straight wins, we haven&#8217;t even begun to scratch the surface of home winning streaks yet.</p>

<h4>6. Boston Celtics</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 33 games</p>
<p>Unlike the season before, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1987.html" target="_blank">1986-87 Boston Celtics</a> lost in the NBA Finals. They were bested in six games by Magic Johnson&#8217;s Los Angeles Lakers. However, they did continue the same home success that was experienced the year before. They won 33-straight contests on their home floor at the Garden. From December 17 of that year until November 18 of 1987, no one was able to take down the Celtics when they played in Boston.</p>

<h4>5. Portland Trail Blazers</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 34 games</p>
<p>After winning the title the season before, the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/POR/1978.html" target="_blank">1977-78 Portland Trail Blazers </a>were unable to repeat as NBA champions. Although they came up short in the playoffs, this was a very successful season for the Blazers, nonetheless. They finished first in the Pacific Division, and ended the year with a 58-24 record. Among their other accomplishments was a dominating showing on their home court. With Bill Walton leading the way, at just under 19 points-per-game, the Trail Blazers ended up winning 34-straight games at the Memorial Coliseum, that started on March 5, and didn&#8217;t end until February 3 of the following year.</p>

<h4>4. Philadelphia 76ers</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 36 games</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1967.html" target="_blank">1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers</a> finished the season with 68 wins, and capped it all over with an NBA Championship. During this run, Philly had a phenomenal home-stand that started on January 14, 1966, and didn&#8217;t end until January 1, 1967. An impressive 36 games straight at the Convention Hall. This kind of success was possible because the Sixers were a very well-balanced group that also benefitted from having Wilt Chamberlain manning the paint. His numbers on the year were shocking, as he averaged 24.1 points-per-game and 24.2 rebounds on top of that. There was no stopping that.</p>

<h4>3. Boston Celtics</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 38 games</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1986.html" target="_blank">1985-86 Boston Celtics</a> started a trend of winning consecutive home games that was eventually picked up by the next year&#8217;s squad. Starting on December 10, 1985, and continuing all the way until November 28, 1986, there was no stopping the Celtics when they played in front of their home crowd. In the span of this streak, the Celtics, led by Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Danny Ainge, also managed to capture an NBA Championship. This was a good time to be from Boston.</p>

<h4>2. Orlando Magic</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 40 games</p>
<p>The Orlando Magic were a force to be reckoned with on their home floor from March 21, 1995 to March 19, 1996. Their streak lasted for 40 games straight. The reasons it became so difficult to beat the Magic at their home court of Orlando Arena, can be broken down into three words: Shaq and Penny. In the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/1996.html" target="_blank">1995-96</a> season, Shaquille O&#8217;Neal and Anfernee Hardaway averaged almost 50 points-per-game combined. That type of offensive output is almost unbeatable. Unless, of course, you happen to be&#8230;</p>

<h4>1. Chicago Bulls</h4>
<p>Winning streak: 44 games</p>
<p>&#8230;the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1996.html" target="_blank">1995-96 Chicago Bulls</a>, considered by many to be the greatest team of all time. His Airness, <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/pippesc01.html" target="_blank">Scottie Pippen</a>, and the rest of Bulls finished the year with the best record in history, at 72-10. They were first in the league in points-per-game, offensive rating, defensive rating, and, quite frankly, overall dominance. And, of course, they weren&#8217;t beaten at home in 44 straight games.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s how you do it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James is the best basketball player in the world, but sometimes he can't even come close to living up to that standard.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_719122" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-719122 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/James-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>When LeBron James told everyone he was glad his Cleveland homecoming was over, it was pretty clear what he meant &#8212; for a guy that&#8217;d spent his entire on-record time alternatively hyping the Cavs&#8217; home opener and downplaying it as the regular season game that it actually was, his forgettable statline was going to be under the microscope typically reserved for players playing in games that really matter, like the playoffs. The fact that they were playing the Knicks, who had just been booed out of Madison Square Garden after a convincing loss to the Chicago Bulls (the first game that most NBA fans saw of the season), was even worse.</p>
<p>That said, there are times when Carmelo Anthony will spend a few weeks playing like the best scorer in the known universe, and those are the times when it&#8217;s all right to lose to the Knicks. Anthony was not playing like that last night, and the Cavs still lost. For a team that opened the season as heavy favorites to come out of the East, despite the fact that James is the only player in the starting five who could give you a working example of defense, this is not exactly what they wanted to happen, even if it is just the first game in a long season for a new team.</p>
<p>LeBron is the best player in the NBA. That&#8217;s an inarguable point by now, and while he&#8217;s never going to make it to that Jordan, Russell, and Wilt tier of players who become mythological beings in the basketball pantheon &#8212; and it&#8217;s a distinct possibility that no player from the Internet age will &#8212; he&#8217;s still tremendous. That doesn&#8217;t mean he hasn&#8217;t had terrible games. Let&#8217;s look at some of the worst.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_719165" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-719165 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/LeBron-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>5. Game One, NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals, 2008</h4>
<p>The Boston Celtics were the bane of LeBron&#8217;s formative years, at least after they brought in Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, and the Boston Big Three were one of the (unstated but obvious) reasons behind James teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. Back in 2008, though, LeBron was becoming the youngest player to score 10,000 points in NBA history, and the C&#8217;s were busy crafting the biggest single season record turnaround at the same time. When they met in the Eastern Conference Semis, sparks were expected, particularly after they&#8217;d tied their regular season series.</p>
<p>If there were sparks in that first game, though, they were the vague beginnings of a garbage fire &#8212; James made just two shots out of 18 and committed ten turnovers on his way to watching Cleveland lose 72-76 in what was one of the more unwatchable games in recent (L)Eastern Conference history. James was missing fingerrolls, missing teammates on passes, and generally looking like an athletically gifted wing who couldn&#8217;t hit anything from anywhere. It was rough.</p>
<h4> 4. Game One, NBA Regular Season, 2014-2015</h4>
<p>At the half, Lebron was one for nine from the field, with two assists and three turnovers. He couldn&#8217;t find his teammates, flubbing passes on the fast break and in the half court, and earning the compassionate ire of television analyst Charles Barkley, who was, predictably, getting on James for thinking too much. At least Cleveland wasn&#8217;t trying to learn the Triangle at the same time?</p>

<h4>3. Game Six, NBA Finals, 2011</h4>
<p>The first time LeBron James made it to the NBA Finals, it was him, a ragtag band of players, and head coach Mike Brown going up against Gregg Popovich and the San Antonio Spurs. It was a sweep for Tim Duncan and company, but no one really expected anything different: Even though it was true that Michael Jordan had never lost in the Finals, it was also true that His Airness (James&#8217;s de facto comparison) spent years toiling away before he made it that far. No one held 2007 against LeBron. That was not the case in 2011, when the Dallas Mavericks took their exceptional coaching and got into James&#8217;s head, holding him to just one make from the free throw line and forcing him to cough up the ball six times.</p>
<h4>2. Game Five, Eastern Conference Finals, 2013-2014</h4>
<p>In another decisive defeat for Miami, our intrepid hero was forced into the scary yellow wall that was the Indiana Pacers defense &#8212; where he was hounded by Paul George, David West, Lance Stephenson, and the ghost of Roy Hibbert. Game Five of the ECF was his personal low point against the best defense in the league, as Indiana held him to the lowest score of his playoff career (7) and just two shots made, not to mention five fouls. It was brutal, but it was also relaxing for Miami supporters, since even with the abysmal play from LeBron, they only won by three points. Miami would win the series.</p>

<h4>1. Game Five, Eastern Conference Semifinals, 2009-2010</h4>
<p>It had to be this one. LeBron&#8217;s last home game in Cleveland before The Decision changed his life, as well as his career, was the entire NBA fandom watching as King James completely and utterly bailed on his hometown franchise. It was the team&#8217;s biggest playoff loss ever, and even though he was playing with a sprained elbow no one who was tuned into that game could ever forget watching one of the league&#8217;s biggest stars sleepwalk through what was a must win game. The statline (22 points, seven assists, six rebounds) doesn&#8217;t read too terribly, and the bad shooting night aside &#8212; James went three for 14, including nothing but misses from beyond the arc &#8212; you could make the argument that this wasn&#8217;t his worst game.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;d be wrong, and if you were saying that it would be clear to all involved that you weren&#8217;t watching the game that night. This was the night LeBron James checked out of Cleveland to secure his legacy, and it happened in real time, during the game, on that very basketball court.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The NBA is talking about raising the age limit for players again, from 19 to 20. This would get rid of the NCAA's one-and-done athletes, but is it a good idea?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_618026" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NBA-Draft.jpg"><img class="wp-image-618026 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NBA-Draft.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a> Source: Brent Soderberg (bikeride) / Flickr Creative Commons[/caption]</p>
<p>Since 2006, when the National Basketball Association raised its eligibility from 18 to &#8220;one year removed from high school,&#8221; there have been murmurs that the league would want to bump it up even further. Commissioner Adam Silver said so himself, describing it as the NBA&#8217;s top priority as recently as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10803355/adam-silver-says-pushing-back-nba-age-limit-top-priority" target="_blank">two months ago</a>. Cynically speaking, the only reasons to follow through with this are to bolster the bleeding ranks of the NCAA, which has criticized the NBA&#8217;s current policy of encouraging a one-and-done mentality among its students, and to alleviate draft pressure on the 30 professional basketball teams that make up the league by restricting the potential pool of players.</p>
<p>That is to say, an 18-year-old wunderkind can turn into a 19-year-old bullet best dodged very easily, and keeping eligibility down helps NBA general managers pick more seasoned prospects, which help them keep their jobs. No one wants to draft the next big draft bust, and while some of them &#8212; think Greg Oden &#8212; have enough talent for the No. 1 spot but don&#8217;t have the durability to match, the other half are players that just aren&#8217;t meant for the NBA.</p>
<p>An astute GM can hedge the bets and roll the dice on players that are red flagged and get lucky from time to time. <em><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a> </em>has brought up Jared Sullinger as one of the players with top five talent that ended up going in the back end of the first round. Nate Silver looked into the best time for an NBA team to draft currently eligible players and what that might mean for the league going forward.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_664020" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Euroleague-basketball-source-Rudolf-Getel-Flickr.jpg"><img class="wp-image-664020 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Euroleague-basketball-source-Rudolf-Getel-Flickr.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="414" /></a> Source: Rudolf Getel / Flickr Creative Commons[/caption]</p>
<h4>International players </h4>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out how Silver went about collecting his data. Looking at each draft from 1995 until 2013, he set out to see what sort of relationship there was between how many years a player spent between high school and the NBA, and whether that had any sort of reasonable impact upon their Win Shares, a measurement developed by baseball analysts and ported over to basketball when the typical box score started to feel inadequate. Win Shares, which split into offensive and defensive components, purport to quantify how helpful a player is on either side of the court. There&#8217;s a danger in relying too heavily on any stat that boils down the complexity of basketball into a single number, but WS is one of the best developed so far. For reference, Kevin Durant lead the league in offensive win shares this year, while Defensive Player of the Year Joakim Noah finished first in defensive win shares. It <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2014_leaders.html" target="_blank">correlates well to the eye test</a>, is the point.</p>
<p>Beyond, that, though, no one group suffers more from their collective risks than international players. For one thing, the group encompasses everyone from Brandon Jennings, who spent a year in Italy instead of the NCAA, to players like Nikola Mirotic, who was drafted in 2011 but has yet to make his NBA debut. As such, the international constituency suffers when it comes to first-year impact, posting a collective WS of under 1: the only group that lands in such an underwhelming bracket. Interestingly, though, international players hit their peak, just below 3 win shares, at the same time as the next group.</p>
<h4>Juniors and seniors</h4>
<p>Lumped together for reasons that seem to be &#8220;these players aren&#8217;t pegged to go pro before they even make it to the NCAA,&#8221; drafted juniors and seniors start off better than their foreign counterparts, peak early (between their third and fifth years), and round out the decade right about where they started, just below 2 WS. Given the fact that most players hit their basketball peaks at around 28 years old, this sounds correct &#8212; a given senior is roughly 22 upon graduation, so five years on would put him at his athletic prime, more or less.</p>

<h4>Sophomores</h4>
<p>After four years in the NBA, sophomores are producing the most win shares against other players drafted at the same position, and the difference isn&#8217;t even close. &#8220;Through their first four NBA seasons, sophomores produce about 10 percent more wins than the average players chosen in their draft slots,&#8221; writes Silver, while noting that the group also makes the largest impact in year one. So why are the sophomores coming in second on this list? Mostly because their ceiling isn&#8217;t as high as their younger counterparts. Sophomores tend to peak in their fifth year, which coincidentally runs concurrent to most players&#8217; first max contract opportunities. This can lead to situations like the Silver-cited Rudy Gay, who nabbed a max deal from Memphis and then failed to get any better, and it can also lead to the Chris Paul phenomenon, when the star player recognizes his abilities early and leaves after the team fails to gain significant postseason headway.</p>
<h4>Freshmen (and high school)</h4>
<p>When it comes to the ultimate and lasting impact of a draft class on the NBA, though, the answer isn&#8217;t even close. While the league hasn&#8217;t allowed prep-to-pro jumps since 2006, Silver has (correctly) lumped them together because a data set of just eight years is hardly large enough to justify drawing conclusions from. Acknowledging that this list includes players from a decade of high school straight in, 1996 to 2006, the sustained success prospects that came straight from high school or after a one-and-done college campaign are staggering. You can check out the graph, plus Silver&#8217;s thoughts on the ideas behind drafting sophomores, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/drafting-sophomores-is-a-smart-strategy-for-nba-teams/" target="_blank">here</a>. <em>FiveThirtyEight </em>cites the indispensable <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Basketball-Reference</a> for numbers, and any chance you have to poke around that site, you absolutely should.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[LeBron James is the best player in the NBA right now. Michael Jordan was the best player in the NBA for much of the '90s. Will James ever be Jordan?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_456114" align="aligncenter" width="594"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/jordan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-456114" alt="Source: Thinkstock" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jordan.jpg" width="594" height="396" /></a> Source: Thinkstock[/caption]

The totality of sports comes down to competition. That is the forceful comparison of one athlete against another in an effort to determine which player is, ultimately, the best. It’s lose and go home. The comparison loses a little bit of luster in team sports, but not a ton in basketball, where individual players have to play offense and defense, and there are only five guys on the court per team at any given time.

The point here is that superstars shine brightest in the NBA. No other sport can be boiled down so succinctly to one-on-one action (aside from the various punching and kicking disciplines), and when someone’s ‘The Best in the League,’ they earn every single one of those capital letters. At two close but distinct points in recent NBA history, LeBron James and Michael Jordan have both been the best.

James is that very thing right now. Jordan was that thing for almost the entire ’90s. Since no one can be content with separate bests, they’ve been compared against each other almost as soon as LeBron entered the league, all the way back to 2003. Even though Kareem put it best when <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/sports/20140326/kareem-abdul-jabbar-shows-interest-linking-with-milwaukee-bucks-ownership-group" target="_blank">he told <em>The Daily News</em></a> that, “It’s impossible to judge over the generations. Every ten years you should have rank a 10-year team,”  it remains that LeBron’s never going to be Jordan-esque, no matter how hard he tries. Let’s take a look at why that is.

<!--nextpage-->

&nbsp;

<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/source-Keith-Allison-Flickr16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-624732" alt="Wizards v/s Heat 03/30/11" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/source-Keith-Allison-Flickr16.jpg" /></a>
<h3><strong>1. The Resume</strong></h3>
LeBron’s  got 7 All-NBA Selections, 5 All-Defensive first team selections, 4 MVP awards (in 5 years), 10 selections to the All-Star game, and a pair of championship rings. That’s pretty rad. It’s not quite Jordanesque, though. LeBron’s in his 11th season, and when Jordan was at that same point — he’d taken two years off in order to cope with the murder of his father, so his 11th season was the 1996 season when the Bulls ran rampant over everyone — he was still better.

Jordan, in 1996, was a 10-time All-Star, 8 time All-NBA first team,   Defensive Player of the Year, Four time MVP, Four time Finals MVP, Four time NBA Champion, and 7-time All Defense first team. Again, that’s when he took two years off, so it would be pretty easy to add a pair to the All-NBA and All-Star award count.

Then there’s the single fact that makes as much of the point as a single statistic ever could. Jordan’s perfect in the Finals. He never lost a series. Opine all you want about the power of a great supporting cast, but LeBron bombed out on his own — to the Spurs in 2007; don’t look at LeBron’s teammates, it’s just depressing — and with the Heatles (in 2011.) Whatever else James accomplishes, he’ll never have Jordan’s 100 percent success rate on the game’s biggest stage.

<h3><strong>2. LeBron’s Not a Victory-Crazed Jerk</strong></h3>
It’s been said often, but Jordan’s will to win — as positive as it sounds on motivational posters and in bite-sized sound clips from feverish announcers — has more or less crippled him in his dealings with people. Take a look at that clip up there — right about the 1:20 mark, Jordan starts talking about how he met OJ Mayo, then a high schooler at his college-level basketball camp. Mayo, in the grand tradition of many fine hoops players, starts talking smack to Jordan, who was guarding him.

Jordan shot the camp down and kept playing Mayo one-on-one, telling him that, “Look, you might be the best high school player in the country, but I’m the greatest that ever lived.” Look at the sadistic glee in his eye when he says it. LeBron doesn’t have that unless it’s game six of the 2012 NBA Eastern Conference Finals, which is a good thing for LeBron the human being, but a bad thing for LeBron the basketball player.

Oh, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZzs4kbGbiE" target="_blank">here’s OJ Mayo’s take</a> on the Jordan/Mayo showdown. Check out the difference in tone. Mayo’s in awe, and Jordan’s just the embodiment of pure competitive terror.

<h3><strong>3. LeBron Couldn’t Carry <em>Space Jam</em></strong></h3>
Petty? Maybe. But <em>Space Jam</em> is a bonafide classic children’s movie, and there’s no way LeBron or any other star in the NBA would be able to turn it into that much of an event. Did you see <em>Thunderstruck</em>? You know, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2041488/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">Thunderstruck</a></em>, the 2012 swapping-skills basketball feature film starring Kevin Durant? No, you didn’t see that?

Neither did anyone else. That starred Kevin Durant, one of the most popular basketball players of all time. Would a LeBron movie pull more than <em>Thunderstruck</em>? Probably. Would people refuse to bat an eye at a LeBron basketball film, the same way people just sort of accepted Jordan’s forway into Hollywood? Yeah, right. People get sick of LeBron after a few commercials — he doesn’t have that endless fountain of goodwill that Jordan did. Not that everyone loved Jordan, of course, but people were significantly more tolerant of his extracurricular activities. Plus, there’s no way LeBron vibes with Bird and Bill Murray the same way.

<h3><strong>4. Jordan’s Got the Scoring Titles</strong></h3>
So, for all the advances and nuances in the general basketball fan’s way of looking at the sport, there is really no way to truly overestimate the value of scoring. At least, not Michael Jordan’s scoring. Jordan wasn’t a chucker even though he averaged 23 shots a game for his first 11 years in the league. He was just a machine, garnering 8 scoring titles from his entry into the league through 1996 — the year that he and the Bulls would go 72-10 on their way to a second three-peat. For those of you who are into less traditional stats, consider that Jordan is the number one all time career leader in WinShares. So there’s that, too.

LeBron, on the other hand, is also doomed in this journey — he’s been under the TMZ/Twitter/blogosphere microscope for his entire career. He’ll never be as good as Mike because Mike was allowed to be a mythological entity who just happened to exist on a basketball court. LeBron won’t ever be that. James is an incredible player. He’s built like Karl Malone and can pass like Larry Bird, but what he isn’t, to quote the Celtics’ great, “God in Basketball Shoes.” There’s only one of those, and that’s Michael Jordan.

People play basketball for all sorts of reasons. Because it’s fun. Because it’s a good way to exercise. Because their friends play it. Because of the sound the ball makes when it bounces off the court or the blacktop. Whatever the reason for starting, though, most basketball players play to win. To have more points on the board than the other team when time expires. To not be the 2012-2013 Charlotte Bobcats, holders of the lowest win percentage in National Basketball Association history (10 percent) and a 7-59 record.

Many of these teams are NBA champions. That correlation seems easy when you consider that the best teams are often most likely to emerge as the end-of-the-season victors, but it’s far from an absolute — some of the very best regular-season teams have come up short when it mattered most. One of these squads isn’t even a proper NBA team, but it’s still here because those athletes helped lay the groundwork for the league as we know it. None of LeBron James’s teams have made it yet, although last year’s squad came very, very close. But there are three-peaters and dynasties and record breakers.

Earlier, we wrote about recently <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-nba-teams-in-recent-memory.html/" target="_blank">successful NBA teams</a> based on coaching changes, winning percentages, and the number of playoff home games. This following list is a much simpler representation of the ten most successful NBA teams of all time, ranked according to win percentage.

<h4>10. 1947 Washington Capitals (49-11), 81 percent <strong>win percentage</strong></h4>
Who are the Washington Capitals? Good question. It’s a well-known fact that the NBA generally takes the history of its component parts to be its own – the league was formed through a merger between the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America in 1949 — and the BAA’s Washington Capitals went an unprecedented 49-11 back in 1947. Their heritage fits a little bit better if you consider that they were coached by the legendary Red Auerbach, who would go on to coach and manage the Boston Celtics.

The Capitals also featured the twice-over Hall of Fame talents of Bill Sharman, who would join Red Auerbach on the Celtics’ payroll after the Capitals folded in 1951. Sharman, a shooting guard, would combine with Bob Cousy in the backcourt on their way to four NBA titles before Sharms took his talents to Los Angeles and helped the Lakers win six rings, one as a coach in the ’70s and five from the front office in the 1980s. Inducted to the Hall of Fame as a player and as a coach (in ’76 and ’04, respectively), Sharman is also the guy credited with “inventing” the morning shoot-around before a game.

In the video above, Sharman is wearing number 21. Not that you’ll be able to pick him out, but it’s worth watching, if only to see how the game has evolved in the more than 50 years since the NBA’s debut. (And also to see the league’s first unstoppable basketball team.)

<strong>9. 2007 Dallas Mavericks (67-15), 81 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage</strong>
</strong>

Fresh off their 2006 Finals loss at the hands of the Miami Heat, the Dallas Mavericks hoped to come back the next season a better team, improving on their 60-22 record in 2006 and make more noise in the playoffs. They would eventually do both, but not exactly as they intended.

Dirk Nowitzki came back with a renewed purpose, and with the inextinguishable Jason Terry and Wake Forest alum Josh Howard, the Mavericks pushed forward to a 67-15 record that was good enough to land them the first seed in a highly competitive Western Conference. Nowitzki would win the MVP for his 25/9/3 averages and a 50/40/90 club membership (at least 50 percent field goal percentage, 40 percent from beyond the arc, and at least 90 percent from the free throw line. There are only <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/f5h7w" target="_blank">twenty NBA players</a> who have ever done this).

Then they ran into Don Nelson’s Golden State Warriors. Nelson, a former Mavericks coach and general manager, advocated a small-ball style of play that sacrificed defense for as much offense as possible. The We Believe Warriors, as they would come to be known, upset the Mavericks in the first round, felling Dallas, 4-2, behind a barrage of 3s and an uptempo style of play. After the series, Nowitzki would spend the offseason <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/2007-11-22/news/crocodile-nowitzki/" target="_blank">wandering in Australia</a>, drinking whiskey, playing guitar, and looking for answers. The Mavericks would finally win an NBA championship in 2011, in a rematch with the Miami Heat.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>8. 2000 Los Angeles Lakers (67-15), 81 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage</strong>; won NBA championship</h4>
The 1999-2000 Lakers season culminated in the first purple and gold championship since 1988, when Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the rest of the Showtime Lakers beat Isiah Thomas and the Bad Boy Pistons. The 2000 Lakers were a far cry from the uptempo Lakers of the ’80s, though. This was the Shaqobe Show, featuring the league-warping dominance of Shaq in his prime and the precocious talents of a younger, afro’d Kobe Bryant (still wearing number 8) coming to fruition.

Spearheaded by Phil Jackson and the triangle offense, the Lakers, rounded out by Rick Fox, A.C. Green, Derek Fisher, and Robert Horry, steamrolled everyone in their path. Together, Shaq and Kobe averaged 39 minutes a game and turned in a pair of average stat lines that combined for 52 points, 20 rebounds, and nearly 9 assists. Average per game. Eventually netting themselves the one seed, the Lakers burned through the Peja-Divac-Webber Sacramento Kings, the Jason Kidd-Penny Hardaway Suns, and the most successful Jail Blazer team to come out of Portland (with Rasheed Wallace, Scotty Pippen, and Damon Stoudamire) before running all over Sam Perkins, Mark Jackson, and Reggie Miller in the NBA Finals.

Shaq, who averaged a monstrous 38/16.5 in the series against the Pacers, would finish the postseason with a Finals MVP to complement the one he’d picked up in the regular season. The team would go on to complete the first three-peat since Jordan’s Bulls, winning two more titles in 2001 and 2002 before self-destructing due to infighting between its two star players.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>7. 1992 Chicago Bulls (67-15), 81 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage;</strong> won NBA championship</h4>
By 1992, the wall was down. The season before, the Chicago Bulls had finally knocked off the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, sweeping the Bad Boys (featuring future Bull Dennis Rodman), 4-0, before stomping out the Lakers in a 4-1 rout that saw Jordan, Pippen, and company burn Magic Johnson and James Worthy on both ends of the court. At the outset of the 1992 season, the Bulls seemed primed for at least another Finals appearance.

Magic Johnson, who had just revealed to the world that he was HIV-positive, retired early in the season. Larry Bird, wracked by back pain, would follow suit as the season came to a close. With that, the league would officially belong to Jordan. Before then, though, the ’92 Bulls would set a franchise record with 67 wins, taking head coach Phil Jackson’s triangle offense to the next level. Sweeping the Heat, 3-0, beating the Knicks in a tightly contested semifinal contest (although the Bulls would win Game 7 decisively — the final score was a one-sided 110-81), stomping the Daugherty-Elho Cavaliers in the ECF and making Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers miserable in the Finals.

Jordan and Pippen would team up for another championship in 1993, and later for three more between 1996 and 1998. Those six championships remain the only Finals victories in the team’s history. Those wins make the Bulls the third-winningest franchise of all time, behind the Celtics and the Lakers.<!--nextpage-->

<strong>6. 1986 Boston Celtics (67-15), 81 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage;</strong> won NBA championship
</strong>

One of the few crews on the short list for best team ever, the 1986 Boston Celtics are widely regarded as a shining example of “playing the right way.” Between the superstar front court of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, and the backcourt of Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge, with a rare strain of Bill Walton (read: healthy) growing off the bench, the ’86 C’s rank as the most talent-rich team on this list. Coached by KC Jones and a record-holding 50-1 at home, this team was a do-it-all threat: a top ten in the league for scoring and defense with above-average rebounders and passers at every position.

They held Air Jordan at bay without just beating him up, a la Detroit (no small feat, considering he went full beast mode in the first round with a pair of games that saw him go off for 49 and 63). They rolled through everyone. They had mustaches and wore them without irony. They were the topic of a goofy NBA documentary (see below). They had Bill Walton, the best walking anecdote of all time, and Larry Bird, the stone coldest of the stone cold, on the same team. Yin and yang. Mustaches and mayhem. The 1986 Celtics.

<h4>5. 1973 Boston Celtics (68-14), 83 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage</strong></h4>
But the ’86 squad wasn’t even the winningest Celtics team of all time. That honor goes to the ’73 Boston Celtics, who went 68-14 and are the only team on this list to win that many games without winning a championship. Powered by the twin engines of center Dave Cowens, wing maestro John Havlicek, underrated guard Jo Jo White (pictured above), and guided by “always faster, always faster” coach (and Celtics lifer) Tommy Heinsohn, the Celtics played to Tommy’s vision, finishing with the third-highest pace in the league (114.5, courtesy of <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1973.html" target="_blank">basketball-reference</a>) at the time and a full 14 points faster than the 2013-2014 Philadelphia 76ers, who <a href="http://bkref.com/tiny/Oy26G" target="_blank">top the league in pace</a> right now.

While Cowens would go on to win the MVP award for the regular season, Havlicek would separate his shoulder against the Knicks in the Conference Finals, and the Celtics would end up losing, 4-3. The Celts would right the ship the next year and win it all in ’74, but that team didn’t win enough games to qualify for this list.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>4. 1967 Philadelphia 76ers (68-13), 84 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage; </strong>won NBA championship</h4>
“The best team I ever saw was the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers,” <a href="http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/sixers_66-67.html" target="_blank">said Wilt Chamberlain</a> (pictured). Take that with as many grains of salt as you want — Chamberlain, one of the greatest centers of all time and the only player in NBA history to ever score 100 points in a game, was a key component to that squad. In a league that had yet to have its talent watered down by expansion, Wilt’s 76ers squad started its season at 46-4, and Chamberlain was in the middle of it all, averaging 24 points, 24 rebounds, and 8 assists a game. The team’s average of 125 points per game is still an NBA record.

In the postseason, the 76ers handled Oscar Robertson (who had just come off a 30-6-10 season of his own) and the Cincinnati Royals in the first round before meeting up with Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. While Chamberlain would end up the eventual loser in his career match-ups with Russell, this time the 76ers were victorious, dispatching the Celts, 4-1, and then rolling Rick Barry and the San Francisco Warriors (later rechristened the Golden State Warriors) in the NBA Finals. The victory would be the first of a pair of NBA championships for Chamberlain, who would win again in 1972 as a member of the Lakers.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>3. 1997 Chicago Bulls (69-13), 84 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage;</strong> won NBA championship</h4>
The ’96-’97 Bulls, coming off a season that we’ll get to momentarily, came to the NBA’s regular season victorious from a memorable finals victory against the Seattle Supersonics with their previous roster intact, although they had added a 44-year-old Robert Parish, who stuck around for about half the season. But Jordan was there. Pippen was there. Rodman, Kukoc, Kerr, and Longley were there. It was the sophomore album for the most dominant team the NBA had ever seen, and they responded accordingly.

Narrowly missing the opportunity to make history by settling for 69 wins (no NBA team has ever won 70 games in back-to-back seasons), the ’97 Bulls nevertheless revisited the same story from the year before — shooting holes in Chris Webber’s Washington Bullets, Christian Laettner(!)’s Atlanta Hawks, and Tim and Alonzo’s Miami Heat – on their way to running rampant over John Stockton, Karl Malone, and the rest of the Utah Jazz. This season counts as Jordan’s penultimate appearance on this list.

<h4>2. 1972 Los Angeles Lakers (69-13), 84 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage</strong>; won NBA championship</h4>
The return of Wilt the Stilt! The return of Bill Sharman! That’s right: Sharman, whom we remember from being the star player of the No. 10 team on our list, the BAA’s Washington Capitals, came back to coach the second-winningest team in NBA history, the 1972 Los Angeles Lakers. With Chamberlain having landed in L.A. after his stint in Philadelphia, Sharman had the greatest center of all time paired with the prototypical star NBA wing in Elgin Baylor. At least, he had them together for all of nine games, before Baylor’s chronic knee problems finally forced him to retire. Luckily, Jerry West, the only player to win the NBA Finals MVP award while playing for a losing team, was able to step it up, averaging 25 points and a career-best 9.7 assists.

Playing at a speed best described as “even faster than Heinsohn,” the Los Angeles Lakers would notch a pace <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1972.html" target="_blank">of almost 117</a> on their way to an NBA-record 33 straight wins and a championship victory over the New York Knicks (who featured future Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Earl Monroe, and Walt Frazier). Chamberlain would lead the league in rebounds and field goal percentage and would join Elgin in retirement at the end of the season. Baylor would receive a championship ring from the organization despite his early departure from the roster.

<strong>1. 1996 Chicago Bulls (72-10), <strong>87 <strong>percent</strong> <strong>win percentage; won NBA <strong>championship</strong></strong></strong>
</strong>

According to Vince Lombardi, winning is a habit. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AVbiKAwKDCoC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=winning+that%E2%80%99s+joyless+is+like+eating+in+a+four-star+restaurant+when+you%E2%80%99re+not+hungry&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mwdhy2KmB-&amp;sig=VBQLYNpm21ZkRzvO8kQHTKAQO_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jQ0WU_2iLIrN0wGBuYDwCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg" target="_blank">According to Bill Russell</a>, “Winning that’s joyless is like eating in a four-star restaurant when you’re not hungry.” The winningest NBA team of all time, the 1996 Chicago Bulls, went 72-10 and had a blast. Michael Jordan had come back at full strength. They had Scottie Pippen. They had Dennis Rodman. They had Steve Kerr. They had Michael Jordan <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faZxq1XjdPY" target="_blank">punching Steve Kerr in the face</a> – you want to watch that. And they had a mission. After spoiling Jordan’s return from retirement by being bounced in the 1995 playoffs by Shaq and Penny’s Orlando Magic, the 1996 Chicago Bulls came back with a vengeance.

They started the season 10-1. Then they were 41-3. Then they were 66-9. The ’96 Bulls didn’t lose games: It was that simple. That attitude, combined with a smothering defense, excellent coaching, and the best offensive player of all time, helped them roll through the postseason, too. They only lost three games in the playoffs, and their 72-10 record stands on a precipice of its own.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_610935" style="width: 650px;"><a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Photo-Courtesy-of-Ricardo-Velasquez-licensed-through-Flickr-via-Creative-Commons.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-610935 " title="Nike Shoes.

More than any other sport, basketball lives and dies by its footwear. They’re the tools of the trade, as well as collector’s items, and generally occupy a space for sneakerheads to unleash their inner completist and fill every inch of closet space imaginable. Other professional sports have specialized equipment — but how many hours can really be spent taping up a hockey stick just like Sidney Crosby’s? Football players have strict guidelines around  their apparel, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/12/19/griffin-fined-10000-for-wearing-adidas-apparel-to-postgame-news-conference/" target="_blank">the league takes those guidelines very seriously</a>. Basketball players? They can wear whatever footwear they want. They can also buy as many pairs as they want –<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/warriors/ci_22116219/sole-man-warriors-jarrett-jack-owns-1-500" target="_blank"> just ask Jarret Jack</a>.

Since the NBA is such a star-driven league — it’s the only major U.S. sport with players that don’t have their faces obscured by helmets or other protective gear — it only follows that the big shoe companies would give big money to the big stars. The NBA: where big shoe deals are made. Actually, though, the basketball shoe (and the basketball shoe endorsement) predates the modern NBA’s founding in 1949 — the Converse All-Star, first created as a soccer shoe, took on new life as the Chuck Taylor signature basketball sneaker in 1932.

According to legend, Taylor never took a portion of the cut from any of the Converse that were sold. We’re pretty certain that’s not the case with this batch of NBA superstars.

<h3><strong>10. Chris Paul — $4 million — Nike (through Jordan)</strong></h3>
Mr. Argyle. The State Farm Agent. Chris Paul. Probably the best point guard in the league, Paul makes a nice bit of cash from his CP3 shoe — currently in its eighth iteration, and marketed by Nike as #Riquickulous.  Paul, who signed with Nike after his Rookie of the Year campaign in the 2004-2005 season, has a whole room in his bedroom dedicated to basketball shoes. You can see a photo his wife posted to Instagram that, in her words, shows “only a portion of the #shoes in <a href="http://instagram.com/cp3s" data-reactid=".r[0].[0].[1].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[1].[0].[0].[0].[0].[1].[2][1].[7]">@cp3s</a> shoe room” below. No word on whether Paul, who is generously listed at an in-shoes 6’0 by the NBA, can reach that top shelf.

<h3><strong>9. Blake Griffin — $6 million — Nike (through Jordan)</strong></h3>
Coming in just ahead of his Lob City compatriot is Blake Griffin, the All-Star Power Forward who might be the biggest endorsement hound in the NBA today. At least, it feels that way, as the airwaves are saturated with his ads for Kia and Foot Locker. No complaints from us, Blake. You gotta get it while you can.

Get it he has. After signing with Jordan back in 2012, Blake’s Super.Fly signature shoe has been flying off the shelves. Almost as fast as the new Kia Optima, probably. Luckily, Griffin’s got nothing if not a sense of humor — he famously interned at Will Ferrell’s comedy website Funny or Die during the 2011 lockout — and his Foot Locker commercial from last summer confirmed that he is, in fact, in on the joke.

<h3><strong>8. Dwight Howard — $6 million — Adidas</strong></h3>
Ok, this was a little surprising. Mostly because <a href="http://bit.ly/1hhlgu4" target="_blank">everyone hates Dwight Howard</a>. He gets hated on by Magic fans, Lakers fans, doctors, other players, owners, and more or less everyone that isn’t on board with the Houston Rockets this year.

On the other hand, he is still the best center in the NBA right now, and the three time Defensive Player of the Year’s Adidas D Howard 4 sneaker has been a hot commodity since he signed with the brand in 2004. Ten years in, the deal seems to be working out pretty well for both sides.

Howard’s commercial game, like his post moves, need a little bit of work, though. After a turn for the serious with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1jaY32WuLA" target="_blank">Fast Don’t Lie</a> campaign, Dwight most recently dabbled in Ghost Hunting for Footlocker. See the results for yourself (and make sure your volume is low.)

<h3><strong>7. Amar’e Stoudemire — $6.5 million — Nike</strong></h3>
Wait, what? Sure, back in the day, in Phoenix, Amar’e was a machine. Running a gorgeously deadly high pick and roll with Steve Nash to propel the 7 Seconds or Less Suns to serious contender status. Amar’e used to be a great basketball player. Six or Seven years ago.

Since being run ragged by Mike D’Antoni in 2011, though, STAT has been a shell of himself — 48 games. That’s how many times Amar’e has been a starter since the lockout. But here he is, at number 7 on this list. Madness. Anyway, STAT just had  his latest Nike (a ‘collaboration’ with LeBron) released a couple of months ago. It actually looks pretty good. Maybe that’s where all this cash is coming from?

<h3>6<strong>. Carmelo Anthony — $9 million — Nike (through Jordan)</strong></h3>
Carmelo Anthony is an under-appreciated superstar. Some of this is his own fault. Some of this is the fact  that the Knicks are awful. Whatever the case may be, it makes his new series of Jordan commericals, the latest in a long string since he signed with Team Jordan back in 2003 hilarious.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YjFimMufqXU" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Anthony, who has an entire montage dedicated to the clutch shots he’s missed this season <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrAc6xwvXJ8" target="_blank">on Youtube</a>, has been the captain of a sinking ship in New York this season, with his Knicks limping to a 21-36 record that’s 5.5 games out of the playoffs. That’s not really his fault, nor can you place the entire fate of a franchise on one player, and his latest shoes, the Melo M10, are pretty fly.

But <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCaxd7L3T4c" target="_blank">does this look like</a> the body language of a guy who’s really happy making $9 million from his shoes? No, I didn’t think so, either. It’ll be interesting to see what happens to Melo’s shoe popularity if he flees the wreckage that is the New York Knicks in his impending free agency.

<h3><strong>5. Dwyane Wade — $12 million — Li Ning
</strong></h3>
Ok, this is the one outlier on our list — Wade’s deal with Chinese shoe manufacturer Li Ning. Wade, who had grudgingly been with Nike/Jordan since 2003 when they bought Converse (his original sponsor), signed with Li Ning in 2012, becoming the biggest shoe related coup since Grant Hill signed with FILA. While Li Ning had signed shoe deals with Shaq, Baron Davis, and Evan Turner, Wade was the only real superstar to sign with the brand while he was still a superstar, even if he was on the tail end of that trajectory by 2012.

After signing with the company, Wade and Li Ning made a commercial titled “Make Your Own Way” that provided a visual accompaniment to his decision to leave Jordan and Nike and create his Way of Wade sneaker (and judging by his position on this list, Wade’s way is paying dividends.)

<h3><strong>4. Kevin Durant — $14 million — Nike</strong></h3>
You had to know this one was gonna be on here. Kevin Durant, bonafide basketball icon (<a title="Could Kevin Durant Touch Jordan’s Legacy?" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/nba/could-kevin-durant-touch-jordans-legacy.html/">and possible Jordan-chaser</a>) has had a fiscally healthy relationship with Nike since signing a deal with them back in 2007. Durant, who’s latest shoe, the KD VI, comes in every size and shape you can think of — hi-top, low-top, toddlers, size 15 — and is sported by <a href="http://newsok.com/okc-thunder-notebook-debate-emerges-in-denver-on-kevin-durants-shoes/article/3922425" target="_blank">at least a few other players around the NBA </a>is undoubtedly one of the most popular pair of kicks in the basketball sneakers world.

Despite his recent protestations that he doesn’t dig the “Slim Reaper” nickname, Durant’s got to remember that he doesn’t get to choose that one.

<h3><strong>3. Derrick Rose — $21 million — Adidas</strong></h3>
We all remember this one. We spent a whole year watching it. <a href="http://nesn.com/2013/12/demarcus-cousins-takes-shot-at-derrick-rose-jokes-about-getting-his-own-comeback-commercial/" target="_blank">DeMarcus Cousins makes jokes about it</a>. The Return was Adidas’s 2013 ad campaign about Derrick Rose’s rehab. It was a great commercial the first time. By the hundredth time, it had lost some luster. After seeing how much Adidas was paying Rose to get back onto the court, though, all the airtime made sense.

Rose, the youngest NBA MVP ever (and it was a legitimate award — he was the best player on the best team) was the next iteration of NBA superstar, and his deal with Adidas, inked in his rookie year, had been increased to a 14-years and $250 million, <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/7614637/chicago-bulls-derrick-rose-thrilled-lock-long-term-deal-adidas" target="_blank">according to <em>ESPN</em></a>. With his future uncertain, it’s almost a guarantee that Adidas is regretting the contract, while the rest of us are just regretting the fact that we don’t get to watch him play.

Instead of putting up that commercial (we’ve all seen it enough), here are some Rose highlights from his too-brief return in 2014.

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h3><strong>2. Kobe Bryant — $34 million — Nike</strong></h3>
Did you know that Kobe was originally signed to Adidas? Back in 1996, when Kobe was just a rookie, he inked a deal with Adidas that lasted him until 2003 when he moved over to Nike. That’s a true story. If you’ve got time, <a href="http://www.kicksologists.com/kobe-bryant-sneakers/" target="_blank">Kicksologists</a> has a comprehensive list with pictures of every one. There’s a ton. A metric ton.

After resigning with Nike in 2007, Bryant went on to cement his legacy with two more championship rings and approximately a zillion more points, residing fourth on the all time scorer’s list. Nike’s decision to stick with Bryant after his image took a huge hit in that Colorado hotel room proved to be a profitable one for all parties involved. Plus, it got him the KobeSystem ad, which is easily the best thing he’s ever done. Ever.

<strong>1. LeBron James — $42 million — Nike</strong></h3>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It’s good to be the king. You get to hang out in your jersey getting interviewed on boats, you can seriously contemplate winning three consecutive NBA titles in a row, and your shoes make you a ton of money. Definitely makes those millions you sacrificed by joining the Heat go down easier.</span>

James, who signed a then-record deal with Nike in 2003 for $90 million dollars, extended with the company in 2010, keeping him signed, sealed, and delivered until 2017.  Really, the only thing that could’ve gone better for James and Nike would’ve been Kobe and LeBron actually meeting in the Finals. But, because they didn’t, those Nike commercials with the puppets are just hilarious filler.

<p style="text-align: left;">During the third quarter of an unremarkable National Basketball Association game between the Chicago Bulls and the Portland Trail Blazers on November 22, Derrick Rose suffered a non-contact injury while trying to grab a rebound after a missed shot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the Blazers brought the fast break up the court, Rose hobbled to the sidelines and was later assisted to the locker room, where security kept out prying eyes. Later that weekend, news broke that Rose, who had torn his ACL in his left knee during the 2012 playoffs and had missed the next season in its entirety to make sure he was 100 percent fit, had a torn medial meniscus in his right knee.</p>
Knee injuries are far from the basketball death knells that they once were, but Rose’s chances to return to All-Star form seem distant as of now, even as hoops fans everywhere wish him a speedy and healthy recovery. With that in mind, here is a look back at six of the NBA’s most infamous knee injuries. This list is not ranked.

<h4>1. Penny Hardaway</h4>
Penny Hardaway looked as if he could be the best point guard of all time. Standing 6 feet, 7 inches and just under two bills, the third pick of the 1993 draft by the Golden State Warriors was traded to the Orlando Magic before the draft was done, and by the end of that first season, Penny-to-Shaq seemed poised to contend for a spot in the best-ever pantheon of one-two punches.

Combining the physical presence and passing acumen of Erving “Magic” Johnson with the boundless athleticism that has come to dominate the basketball landscape, Hardaway in his prime was a better-shooting, better-passing, taller Russell Westbrook. Teamed with a young Shaquille O’Neal, Hardaway’s career reached its zenith in his second season, when he averaged 20 points and 7 assists on the way to the NBA Finals, helping the Magic topple the Jordan’s Chicago Bulls on the way.

And then, in 1997, it all came crashing down. Hardaway’s first knee setback was an ACL injury that, according to <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9506985/dr-james-andrews-breaks-how-historic-sports-careers-saved" target="_blank">Dr. James Andrews</a> -- the knee surgery deity of professional sports -- wasn’t diagnosable at the time owing to technological limitations in medical imaging. While Hardaway never suffered a dramatic collapse to the floor, anyone who was around to see Penny at his peak will tell you that something definitely went wrong, and the end result could barely be mistaken for the same guy who had brought us the untouchable Lil Penny commercials.

Ultimately, Hardaway gathered four All-Star nominations and a pair of All-NBA First Team nods and would go on to play unremarkable minutes for the Phoenix Suns, the New York Knicks, and the Miami Heat, finishing his career in 2007 with a total stat line of 15/5/1.6 steals and six knee surgeries.

<h4>2. Chris Webber</h4>
Why did the Golden State Warriors trade Hardaway? To get their hands on one of the best passing big men of all time: Chris Webber. Fresh off revolutionizing the appeal of college hoops (and underlining the importance of timeouts) as a key member of Michigan’s Fab Five, Webber’s game was brash, confrontational, and totally awesome. With the handles of a point guard and the size of a center, C-Webb had it all.

After threatening to utilize the first-year opt-out clause in his contract with Golden State after clashing with head coach Don Nelson, Webber was traded to the Washington Bullets (now the Washington Wizards), showed flashes of his unique basketball brilliance, and signed a large contract with the team. After three seasons that were equally underwhelming and impressive, Webber landed on the Sacramento Kings in 1998 and became the centerpiece of one of the funnest teams of the last 20 years, leading Sac Town to serious title contention year in and year out.

All that came crashing down in the 2003 playoffs, when Webber suffered a torn lateral meniscus on a non-contact play against the Dallas Mavericks. He was running to catch an alley-oop. Undergoing micro-fracture surgery in the 2003 offseason, Webber would continue to play until 2008 but the injuries continued to pile up, and he never regained his early career form.

<h4>3. Tracy McGrady</h4>
Described by Kobe Bryant as the hardest player to guard in the NBA, Tracy McGrady at his peak was a blend of effortless ability and boundless athleticism with an incredible scoring touch that fans and general managers salivate over. If ever a basketball player had steez -- a combination of style and ease most famously detailed by Will Smith in <em>Men In Black</em> as “making this look good” -- that player was T-Mac.

With a heavy-lidded stare and a half slouch to his posture, McGrady always seemed to be mailing it in a little bit, even when he was furiously piling on the points. After spending most of his rookie season on the bench in Toronto behind cousin Vince Carter, McGrady really blossomed into a superstar in Orlando, turning in one of the all-time greatest single-season stat lines by averaging 32 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists a game. He was 23 at the time.

After his superstar partner never materialized (Grant Hill was on the Magic, but he and McGrady only played 40-something games together in the four years they were both on the team), T-Mac ended up on the Houston Rockets, carrying another oft-injured superstar in Yao Ming and helping the team to a 22-game win streak.

In 2008, he underwent a fairly minor surgical procedure, an arthroscopic knee surgery to clear out loose particles and a small lesion. He was never the same. McGrady's knee never properly recovered from the scope, and he eventually opted for micro-fracture surgery in 2009. The player who once snatched victory from the jaws of defeat by scoring 13 points in 35 seconds would remain earthbound for his tenure in professional hoops.

<h4>4. Michael Redd</h4>
In between commercial breaks during the Blazers-Bulls game that featured the Rose injury, our television was switched to NBA TV's <em>Gametime Live</em>. The channel's flagship television program is standard ESPN-esque talking head flare. As sinister luck would have it, the host and analysts were talking about the Rose injury. Everyone deferred to one analyst, former player Michael Redd, who asked, “Oh, I’m the expert on knee injuries now?”

Redd, a deadeye shooting guard for the Milwaukee Bucks with a too-smooth-for-R&amp;B jump shot that would lead him to a career-high 57 points in 2006, knows exactly how D-Rose is feeling right now: In 2009, coming off an Olympic gold medal and leading the Bucks in scoring, Redd tore his ACL and MCL, sidelining him for the rest of the season and effectively ending Milwaukee’s playoff hopes.

After rehabbing and coming back to the team at a greatly diminished capacity -- he was averaging 12 points over 18 games, a far cry from his pre-injury heights of 25 and 26 -- Redd did the same thing to the same knee almost exactly a year later. This time, it was effectively a forced retirement, as he would only play in 62 games over the next two years, averaging a little over 6 points per game.

<h4>5. Gilbert Arenas</h4>
Now most famous as the poster child for everything that can go wrong in an NBA locker room, Gilbert Arenas, aka Agent Zero, was the franchise hope for the Washington Wizards. Arenas, a shoot-first point guard with a positively vide -game jump shot and a penchant for getting to the line, was following up a 2005-2006 season in which he averaged 29 points and 6 assists with a 28-6 campaign when, in the doldrums of an early April game against the Charlotte Bobcats, he suffered, a medial meniscus tear. The solution, of course, was micro-fracture surgery.

Arenas returned to the court in October 2007 but was sidelined by November, when he went back under the knife to repair another meniscus tear in the same knee. Agent Zero would continue to play intermittently before being suspended for gun possession (a serious no-no in Washington, D.C.), but not before having yet another surgery on the problematic knee.

Arenas’ greatest successes on the court came from the Princeton offense, a pick-and-roll-heavy system that is designed to give perimeter players semi-isolation looks, and before his knees went, Arenas was one of the best in the pick and roll, using the screen to jostle his defender before unleashing a lethal first step, either to create a lane to the basket or to pull up for a fast 3-pointer. After his first surgery, the explosiveness was gone, and Arenas returned to the court without his best offensive asset. He would eventually come off the bench for the Orlando Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies before taking his talents to the CBA, the Chinese Basketball Association.

It’s worth noting that Washington gave Arenas a $111 million contract extension between his first and second surgeries. After being amnestied in 2011, Arenas will make $21 million this year for not playing basketball for the Wizards.

<h4>6. Bernard King</h4>
Drafted in 1977 and reaching his peak in the mid-'80s, Bernard King loomed large as an unstoppable scorer and Brooklyn legend -- not to mention a jealously guarded visage, as far as digital pictures of him are concerned. King could score each and every way, and his potency and resiliency have secured him a heady spot among the biggest and brightest to come from New York City.

Tearing his ACL during the ’85-’86 season may have helped King cement his legacy. It happened late in the season, against the now-in-Sacramento Kansas City Kings -- Bernard was leading the league in scoring at the time.

As his contract lapsed with the New York Knicks, who were understandably leery of keeping him on the roster, King ended up with the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards), where he showed that he still had plenty in the tank. In 1991, he dropped 49 points on the Knicks in Madison Square Garden, had a 52-point game, made the All-Star team, and finished with a 28 point-per-game average at the advanced NBA age of 34.

As basketball fans wish Rose a complete and quick recovery, we can only hope that he returns to the level of a Bernard King rather than a Michael Redd.
