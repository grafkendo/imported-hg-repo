				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_758710" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758710 size-medium" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/David-Beckham-640x444.jpg" alt="David Beckham smiles as he stands on the red carpet." width="757" height="523" /> David Beckham is so cool | Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In case you weren’t aware, soccer happens to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pro-sport-likely-make-famous.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular sport in the world</a>. It might surprise you, but it’s true. As a result of this fact, the best players alive reap major rewards and can <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-expensive-soccer-transfer-fees-ever.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost new teams a pretty penny</a>. As if you needed another reason to be jealous of professional athletes, now you’re about to see how well it pays to be a professional footballer.

<a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2015/03/05/9470632/cristiano-ronaldo-tops-goal-rich-list-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goal.com</a> released their annual “Goal Rich List," which provides a detailed look at which players make the most money and where their wealth comes from. This list considers salaries, endorsement deals, and any form of investment portfolios a player might have as well. So, take a seat if you must because this is going to sting. Here’s a look at the top 1<span class="s1">0</span> richest soccer players on the planet.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Frank Lampard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765647" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765647" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Frank-Lampard-MLS.jpg" alt="Frank Lampard stands on the field between plays." width="757" height="505" /> Frank Lampard, formerly of Manchester City, now plays for New York FC | Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $90 million

Although Frank Lampard currently plays with New York FC in the MLS, it was during his 14-year career in the English Premier League -- 13 with Chelsea and one with Manchester City -- where his fortune truly took off. During his stint at the game's highest level, Lampard pulled in over €35 million in total earnings while matching that mark with an outstanding property portfolio. Throw in the fact that he's also repped both Nike and Adidas, and it's easy to see how Lampard cracked the list of the top 10 richest soccer players.

<h2>9. Ronaldinho</h2>
[caption id="attachment_669575" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-669575" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ronaldinho-OLI-SCARFF-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ronaldinho waves to the crowd." width="757" height="537" /> Ronaldinho waves to the crowd | Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $93 million

It's been some time since Ronaldinho tore up the pitch as a member of Barcelona, but that hasn't stopped the former Ballon d’Or winner from raking in the big bucks. During a recent stint with Atletico Mineiro, he pulled in €2.7 million a year. Now as a member of Querétaro FC, Ronaldinho has an opportunity to earn an additional €2.5 million per year in performance-based incentives. Of course, when it comes to the greatness of Ronaldinho, this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG7I94tNBM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how we'll always remember him</a>.

<h2>8. Raul</h2>
[caption id="attachment_669581" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-669581" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Raul-Gonzalo-Arroyo-Moreno-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Raul wraps his namesake scarf around his neck." width="757" height="505" /> Raul with the sweet towel | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $95 million

Raul may not suit up for Real Madrid, where he made €7 million a year in salary, but that hasn't affected his bank account one iota. Aside from a brief stint with New York Cosmos, Raul <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-8-raul-rich-list-2015/14#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">makes his mark</a> -- and money -- off the field, with business ventures such as Scar Sport Europe (invests in renewable energies), Luri (a property company), and Cadmus (an energy company). As you can see, it's good to be Raul.

<h2>7. Samuel Eto'o</h2>
[caption id="attachment_669585" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-669585" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Samuel-Etoo-Tullio-M.-Puglia-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="A sweaty Samuel Eto'o of Sampdoria runs across the field." width="757" height="504" /> Samuel Eto'o of Sampdoria in action | Tullio M. Puglia/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $98 million

At one point, Samuel Eto'o earned €10 million a year at Barcelona and €5 million at Chelsea. However, those days are behind him. Instead, he opted to collect a massive payday from Anzhi Makhachkala, where he earned nearly half of his total fortune, <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-7-etoo-rich-list-2015/15#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Goal.com</a>. Of course, endorsement deals with both Puma and Ford helped as well.

<h2>6. Kaká</h2>
[caption id="attachment_669590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-669590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kaka-Raphael-Dias-Getty-Images-for-Adidas.jpg" alt="Kaká doing work at a press conference." width="757" height="506" /> Kaká doing work at a press conference | Raphael Dias/Getty Images for Adidas[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $108 million

Kaká is another one of those footballers who gets paid handsomely both on and off the field. Not only has he made plenty of bank playing for clubs like Real Madrid, AC Milan, São Paulo, and Orlando City, but he's also <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-6-kaka-rich-list-2015/16#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolling in endorsement money</a>, courtesy of deals with companies such as Adidas, Pepsi, Samsung, Gillette, and Armani. Let's just say Kaká has it all.

<h2>5. Wayne Rooney</h2>
[caption id="attachment_768418" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-768418 size-medium" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Wayne-Rooney-640x464.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney thanks the fans after winning a game." width="757" height="547" /> Wayne Rooney thanks the fans | Jamie McDonald/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth:</span> $112 million

Wayne Rooney plays striker for both the English National Team and Manchester United. He is the wealthiest player in the English Premier League. Known for his strength on the field, Rooney has evolved into more than just a goal scorer, which is why Man U rewarded him with a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/02/22/wayne-rooney-signs-104-million-contract-with-manchester-united/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$104 million contract</a> in 2014. On top of that, the deal is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26287482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly worth</a> £300,000 a week.

<h2>4. Zlatan Ibrahimović</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638928" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638928" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-FRANCK-FIFE-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Zlatan Ibrahimović celebrates after scoring a goal." width="757" height="487" /> Zlatan Ibrahimović celebrates after scoring a goal | Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $114 million

Zlatan Ibrahimović is a superstar forward who <a href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Jul/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-posts-workout-video-on-Instagram.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently signed a deal</a> to play for Manchester United. While a hefty salary from his club team factors into his net worth, much of Ibrahimović's money comes from endorsement deals and smart investments. <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-4-ibrahimovic-rich-list-2015/18#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Goal.com</a>, he has sponsorship deals with Nivea, Xbox, Volvo, and Dressman; his investments include owning a substantial amount of property. It appears that Ibrahimović is much more than a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh_KNH8QqSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human highlight reel</a>.

<h2>3. Neymar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638915" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638915" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Neymar-Gonzalo-Arroyo-Moreno-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Neymar jogs across the field during a game." width="757" height="505" /> Neymar reacts while playing for Barcelona. | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $148 million

Neymar is the face of Brazilian soccer and one of the main cogs on a talented FC Barcelona team. His skills with the ball and flair for excellence on the pitch make him one of the most popular players in the sport. His annual salary, which stands at <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-3-neymar-rich-list-2015/19#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€8.8 million a year</a>, is small potatoes compared to his <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-3-neymar-rich-list-2015/19#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overwhelming endorsement deals</a>, which include agreements with the likes of Nike, Panasonic, Volkswagen, Red Bull, and many more. That’s not a bad haul for being only 23 years old.

<h2>2. Lionel Messi</h2>
[caption id="attachment_734165" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-734165 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Messi-Alex-Caparros-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Lionel Messi tosses a soccer ball during warmups." width="757" height="502" /> Lionel Messi knows he's good. | Alex Caparros/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $218 million

Lionel Messi is not only a magician on the soccer field, but he’s a businessman off it. His lucrative contract with Barcelona pays him <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45eimdj/4-lionel-messi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$50 million a year</a>, and he has tons of <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-2-messi-rich-list-2015/20#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsement deals on his plate</a>. <span class="s1">Messi</span> works with brands such as Adidas, Samsung, Gillette, Gatorade, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. He is arguably one of the two best soccer players in the world. If he keeps winning Ballon d’Or awards (he’s won four times), which goes to the FIFA World Player of the Year, he’ll surely continue increasing his overall wealth.
<p class="p1"><!--nextpage--></p>

<h2>1. Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Juan-Manuel-Serrano-Arce-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo beams as he walks across the field in the rain." width="757" height="507" /> Cristiano Ronaldo has plenty of reasons to smile | Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total wealth</span>: $230 million

It should come as no surprise that Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo tops this list. For anyone who follows the sport, Ronaldo is the absolute best of the best. He scores goals, dribbles with speed and force, and has sensational ball control.

Ronaldo's deal with Real Madrid pays him a whopping <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7179/galleries/2015/03/05/9536562/goal-rich-list-2015/rl15usd-1-ronaldo-rich-list-2015/21#photo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€18.2 million per year</a>, and that number doesn’t include bonuses. He also crushes it on the endorsement front, has his own clothing line (<a href="http://shop.portugalfootwear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CR7</a>), and owns a profitable property portfolio. Plus, people seem to find him easy on the eyes, so he’s got that going for him. It pays to be Cristiano Ronaldo.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_638980" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638980" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cristiano-Ronaldo-ODD-ANDERSEN-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The World's 5 Highest-Paid Soccer Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Cristiano Ronaldo gives the thumbs up during warm ups | ODD ANDERSEN/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Time and time again, we've seen just how <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-craziest-franchise-owners.html/" target="_blank">crazy some professional sports team owners can be</a>. More often than not, we associate this behavior with questionable dance moves and an affinity for getting fined for constantly questioning the league. Yet, truth be told, a better way to calculate the sanity of these individuals would be to look at the ungodly amount of money they pay their players.

Now that's ludicrous. And when it comes to soccer, an obscene salary is only part of the craziness. We've always known that soccer players get paid handsomely for their services both on and off the field. But it takes actually <em>seeing</em> the numbers for this fact to truly set in. And thanks to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2016/05/11/cristiano-ronaldo-lionel-messi-top-the-worlds-highest-paid-soccer-players/#3448a9065a35" target="_blank">efforts of those fine folks at Forbes</a>, who seriously put in the legwork, our eyes are wide open:
<blockquote>To compile our list of the world’s highest-earnings soccer players, we looked through team filings and spoke with players’ agents, talent agencies, commercial sponsors and soccer experts in the U.S. and Europe. All figures are in U.S. $ and include soccer salaries, bonuses, and endorsements. Transfer fees are excluded. Earnings and performance metrics are for the 2015 calendar year.</blockquote>
As you probably guessed, not all soccer players' bank accounts are created equal. With that in mind, here's a look at the 10 highest-paid soccer players in the world in 2016.

<h2>10. Cesc Fabregas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743210" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743210" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cesc-Fabregas-ANTHONY-DEVLIN-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas has reason to celebrate | ANTHONY DEVLIN/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="464" /> Cesc Fabregas has reason to celebrate | ANTHONY DEVLIN/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $21 million

Midfielder Cesc Fabregas is a big reason why Chelsea has regained its hold (convincingly) at the top of the English Premier League. For his efforts, the Spanish superstar has been paid quite handsomely. Fabregas earned <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/10-cesc-fabregas-chels/#69932acd4aa8">$16 million in salary and bonuses</a> and another $5 million thanks to sponsorship deals with brands like Puma and Beats by Dre, making his total haul for the year a cool $21 million.

<h2>9. Eden Hazard</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570501" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570501" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eden-Hazard-Elsa-Getty-Images-626x500.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="605" /> Eden Hazard is the man at Chelsea | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $22 million

Eden Hazard is the man leading the charge at Chelsea, and he's been paid as such. The Belgian midfielder is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/9-eden-hazard-chelsea/#166908d9546d">collected $18 million in salary and bonuses</a> and another $4 million in endorsement money. Clearly, companies like Topps, Lotus Bakeries, Sina Sports, and Nike think Hazard is worth it. We happen to agree.

<h2>8. Luis Suarez</h2>
[caption id="attachment_552547" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-552547 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Luis-Suarez-OLIVER-LANG-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438709540499.jpg" alt="Luis-Suarez-OLIVER-LANG-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438709540499.jpg" width="757" height="503" /> Luis Suarez is feeling good at Barcelona | OLIVER LANG/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $23 million

Luis Suarez has earned his money at Barcelona, and then some. Thanks to sponsorship deals with companies like Pepsi, Abitab, and Adidas, the all-world striker pulled in $5 million in endorsement money this past year. Throw in another $18 million in salary and bonuses from the club team, and that's <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/8-luis-suarez-barcelon/#4d8db6c83758">$23 million in total earnings</a> in last year. We'd take it.

<h2>7. Sergio Aguero</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673693" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673693" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-523444230.jpg" alt="Manchester City's Sergio Aguero cannot be stopped. | OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="549" /> Manchester City's Sergio Aguero cannot be stopped | OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $24 million

Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is certainly not suffering financially. The sensational striker collected $17 million from his salary and bonuses and added another $7 million in endorsement money from companies such as Pepsi, Puma, and EA Sports. With bank like that, it's no wonder he didn't care about getting <a href="http://www.espnfc.com/manchester-city/story/3026053/sergio-aguero-just-didnt-care-about-fines-for-being-late-frank-lampard">fined for tardiness</a>.

<h2>6. Wayne Rooney</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $26 million

Despite failing to land in the top five, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney is still one of the highest-paid soccer players on the planet. The forward collected <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/6-wayne-rooney-manches/#4c126b55501f">$20 million in salary and bonus money</a>, and pulled in another $6 million from relationships with brands like Harper Collins and Nike. Rooney may never reach the top of the list, but don't expect his bank account to suffer anytime soon.

<h2>5. Gareth Bale</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638909" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638909" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gareth-Bale-David-Ramos-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The World's 5 Highest-Paid Soccer Players in 2016" width="757" height="478" /> Gareth Bale celebrates scoring a goal | David Ramos/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $34 million

While Gareth Bale hasn't exactly been the dominating force Real Madrid hoped he'd be when it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-expensive-soccer-transfer-fees-ever.html/" target="_blank">spent a ridiculous amount of money</a> to bring him over to the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, he's still an explosive player who has come up with crucial goals when his team has needed them the most. And that has helped him earn quite a bit of green.

In 2015, Bale earned $24 million in salary and bonuses while pulling in another $10 million thanks to endorsement deals with companies such as Adidas, BT Sport, and Sony Xperia. With a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/5-gareth-bale-real-mad/" target="_blank">total haul of $34 million</a> from last year, the Welsh superstar comes in at No. 5 on the list of highest-paid soccer players in 2016.

<h2>4. Neymar Jr.</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638915" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638915" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Neymar-Gonzalo-Arroyo-Moreno-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The World's 5 Highest-Paid Soccer Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Neymar reacts while playing for Barcelona | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $36 million

If you think Barcelona phenom Neymar has skills on the field, you should see how he brings the goods on the worldwide web. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/4-neymar-jr-barcelona/" target="_blank">According to Forbes,</a> Neymar is the only player pulling in more dough from his off-the-pitch endeavors than from his salary and bonuses. Considering he earned $14 million from Barca last year, that's saying something.

Of course, when you have 12 endorsement deals, including relationships with brands such as Rexona, Clear, Panasonic, and Nike, the money is never too far behind -- $22 million in 2015 to be exact. And yet, if Neymar's $36 million in total earnings from 2015 is only good enough for fourth place on the list, imagine what the top three are bringing in.

<h2>3. Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735522" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735522" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-PAUL-ELLIS-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his money at Man U | PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his money at Man U | PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $37 million

While Zlatan Ibrahimovic's time with Paris Saint-Germain came to an end last season, the sensational striker, now with Manchester United, continues to be one of the most gifted scorers on the planet. And we all know what happens when soccer players hit the back of the net on a regular basis: They make loads of money.

Ibrahimovic earned $7 million in endorsement money thanks to deals with companies like Nike and Volvo, and he also made a whopping $30 million from his salary and bonuses. With his <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/3-zlatan-ibrahimovic-p/" target="_blank">$37 million haul</a>, the 34-year-old narrowly cracked the top three of this prestigious list. Find a way into the top two, well, that will be a bit more tricky.

<h2>2. Lionel Messi</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638949" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638949" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lionel-Messi-LLUIS-GENE-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The World's 5 Highest-Paid Soccer Players in 2016" width="757" height="504" /> Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring a goal | LLUIS GENE/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $77 million

All Lionel Messi did in 2015 was score 48 goals, help Barcelona secure five trophies, and collect a record-setting fifth Ballon d'Or as the best soccer player on the planet. Oh, and he also earned some serious coin in the process. Our favorite magician pulled in $26 million off the pitch from endorsement deals with big names like Adidas, Gatorade, EA Sports, and Lays.

On top of that, Messi tore it up on the field in more ways than one, bringing in a cool $51 million in salary and bonus money. He may be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/2-lionel-messi-barcelo/" target="_blank">No. 2 on this list</a>, but there is nothing sad about $77 million. Of course, if Messi wishes to cry about his position, we'd be more than happy to take some of that loot off his plate.

<h2>1. Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638957" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638957" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cristiano-Ronaldo-JAVIER-SORIANO-AFP-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The World's 5 Highest-Paid Soccer Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates a victory in the Champions League | JAVIER SORIANO/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $82 million

How could anyone not see this coming? Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is much more than just a goal-scoring machine with sick moves: He's an unstoppable brand -- all by himself. Not only did CR7 earn $53 million for his exceptional play on the field, but thanks to his outstanding relationship with Nike, Herbalife, Clear, and Tag Heuer among others, he also netted a sweet $29 million in endorsement money.

In the world of highest-paid soccer players, there can be only one. And with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlh45fekl/1-cristiano-ronaldo-re/" target="_blank">$82 million in 2015</a>, Ronaldo remains at the top of the mountain (of money).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_833298" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-833298 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Real-Madrid-GERARD-JULIEN-AFP-Getty-Images-e1438710100631.jpg" alt="5 Soccer Players Who Teams Paid Around $100 Million For" width="757" height="565" /> Gareth Bale (L) and Cristiano Ronaldo celebrate for Real Madrid | Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Regardless of the sport, it’s always imperative to try and nab the best available players. Aside from the obvious benefits that come with bringing top athletes into the fold, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pro-soccer-the-5-best-selling-jerseys-in-the-game.html/" target="_blank">perennial superstars help attract</a> an audience, drive ticket sales, and increase the value of the organization. And as we’ve seen from both the NFL and NBA free agency periods, it’s not always easy to get the biggest stars to switch teams. If you think it’s complicated in these leagues, you haven’t seen anything yet: you haven’t seen how it works in international soccer.

While things are a bit easier when a world-class player is no longer under contract, the same cannot be said for when he’s still signed with his current club. To make a deal happen, a team doesn’t just have to come to contract terms with said player, they need to pay his current team for the rights to sign him. This is called a transfer fee. And it’s what makes exchanging players in international pro soccer such a crazy ordeal. Who currently holds the record for the greatest transfer fee of all time? We’re so glad you asked. With that, here’s a look at the five most expensive soccer transfer fees ever.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Angel Di Maria</h2>
[caption id="attachment_833275" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-833275 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Angel-Di-Maria-Michael-Regan-Getty-Images-e1438709261884.jpg" alt="5 Soccer Players Who Teams Paid Around $100 Million For" width="757" height="490" /> Angel Di Maria celebrates after scoring for Manchester United. | Michael Regan/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer Fee</span>: €75 million ($99 million)

In 2014, Manchester United paid €75 million — or £59.7 milion — to Real Madrid for the rights to Argentinian midfielder Angel Di Maria. That expensive price tag was the largest amount any British club had ever paid for a player. And while the 27-year-old signed a five-year deal worth around £200,000 a week, his time at Old Trafford was be short-lived. as the Red Devils <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/story/2545247/di-maria-fee-agreed-between-psg-and-man-united-report" target="_blank">agreed to sell him to the French club Paris Saint-Germain</a> for €63 million (£44.3m)
<h2>4. James Rodriguez</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer Fee</span>: €80 million ($107 million)

Colombia’s James Rodriguez became the talk of the soccer world after his sensational performance at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. It was at that point Spanish giant Real Madrid had to have him. AS Monaco was hesitant to part with the young midfielder, as he had only spent one year with the club. Still, most of the time, money talks. And after coming to a reported transfer fee of €80 million (£63 million), Rodriguez could officially refer to himself as a “Galáctico<em>."</em>
<h2>3. Luis Suarez</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer Fee</span>: €81 million ($109 million)

For all his talent on the pitch, forward Luis Suarez doesn’t come without his <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28180600" target="_blank">fair share of controversy</a>. And yet, even with all the red flags, Barcelona agreed to pay €81 million (£75 million) to Liverpool in the summer of 2014 for the Uruguayan’s services. The risk was high, but it definitely paid off. With Suarez joining Lionel Messi and Neymar to form one of the world’s most lethal threesome, Barca was able to win La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League, securing the second treble in the club’s history.

<h2>2. Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_833290" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-833290 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Quinn-Rooney-Getty-Images-e1438709662782.jpg" alt="5 Soccer Players Who Teams Paid Around $100 Million For" width="757" height="519" /> Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates a goal. | Quinn Rooney/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer Fee</span>: €94 million ($124 million)

Real Madrid agreed to pay Manchester United a then-record €94 million (£80 million) for the rights to bring superstar Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabéu. Since joining Madrid in the summer of 2009, Ronaldo has scored over 300 goals — including a personal-best 61 in all competitions this past year — and helped Los Blancos capture seven trophies in all. On top of that, he consistently finds himself on the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-highest-paid-athletes-in-2015.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">highest-paid athletes</a> list. No matter the cost, Cristiano Ronaldo will always be worth the big bucks.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Gareth Bale</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638909" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638909" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gareth-Bale-David-Ramos-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Soccer Players Who Teams Paid Around $100 Million For" width="757" height="478" /> Gareth Bale celebrates scoring a goal during in Champions League. | David Ramos/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer Fee</span>: €100 million ($132 million)

After dominating in the English Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, superstar Gareth Bale was ready to take his talents to the next level. Real Madrid was happy to oblige him. In 2013, for a world-record transfer fee of €100 million (£85.3m), the Spanish powerhouse made the Welshman’s dreams come true by making him a part of the world’s biggest club. Bale’s impact was immediately felt, as he helped Ronaldo lead Madrid to the club’s 10th Champions League title.

Also worth noting: Brazilian sensation Neymar is <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/barcelona/story/2785898/neymar-ordered-to-appear-in-court-over-barcelona-transfer" target="_blank">currently under a probe regarding 'irregularities' in his transfer from Barcelona</a>. While the true value of his fee has yet to come out, he could potentially make an appearance on this list.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_842948" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Clint-Dempsey-Otto-Greule-Jr-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842948 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Clint-Dempsey-Otto-Greule-Jr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Clint Dempsey scores a goal" width="757" height="513" /></a> Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

No fan in their right mind would confuse the level of play in <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/" target="_blank">Major League Soccer</a> with that of any of the massive leagues throughout Europe, but that doesn’t mean the MLS hasn’t slowly but surely been gaining traction over the last few years.

Following the Los Angeles Galaxy’s 5-1 throttling over New York FC — which also saw the club become the first organization in league history to reach 1,000 goals — Galaxy superstar <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/player/7832/robbie-keane" target="_blank">Robbie Keane</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-galaxy-20150824-story.html" target="_blank">spoke out about</a> the trending nature of America’s top league: “This league is serious, said Keane. “Years ago, there were certain leagues that people wanted to go and play in. This is the league."

According to Forbes, the money is certainly backing up Keane’s sentiments. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2013/11/20/major-league-soccers-most-valuable-teams/" target="_blank">Since 2013</a> — the last time the financial site looked the average value of teams ($103 million) within the MLS — the average value of each team has gone up to $157 million  — an increase of 52%. Whether it’s the owners’ willingness to spend big money to attract top talent, the fans coming out in droves to support their teams, or big names from around the world actually considering the MLS a worthy destination, it’s clear this league is on the up and up.

Of course, as it is with all pro sports, some organizations find themselves worth money more than others. After looking over the financial data from 2014, Forbes was able to show by just how much. So with that in mind, here’s a look at Major League Soccer’s five most valuable teams in 2015.

<h2>5. Toronto FC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_842942" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Michael-Bradley-Vaughn-Ridley-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842942 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Michael-Bradley-Vaughn-Ridley-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Bradley dribbles the ball" width="757" height="565" /></a> Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current value</span>: $175 million</li>
</ul>
With 34 points on the year, <a href="http://www.torontofc.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto FC</a> currently <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings" target="_blank">holds the No. 4 seed</a> in the Eastern Conference. Not only is this club firmly in position for a playoff spot but, according to Forbes, it is sitting pretty in the value department. Despite a 2014 operating income of -$7 million, Toronto FC brought in $32 million in revenue and is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elllf/5-toronto-fc/" target="_blank">currently valued at $175 million</a>. With a winning mentality and stars such as Michael Bradley (pictured above) and Jozy Altidore on the roster, Toronto FC should continue to keep putting goals — both on and off the field — in the back of the net.

<h2>4. Portland Timbers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_842987" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portland-Timbers-Steve-Dykes-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842987 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Portland-Timbers-Steve-Dykes-Getty-Images.jpg" alt=" Maximiliano Urruti #37 of Portland Timbers celebrates with teammate Dairon Asprilla #11" width="757" height="469" /></a> Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current value</span>: $185 million</li>
</ul>
Like  Toronto FC, the Portland Timbers also find themselves sitting in the No. 4 position; albeit in the Western Conference and with 40 points overall. After bringing  in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elllf/4-portland-timbers/" target="_blank">$35 million in revenue</a> last year and finishing 2014 with $4 million in operating income, things are looking pretty for the Timbers. Throw in the fact that this club has a profitable local media deal with Root Sports and also owns the Portland Thorns — which won the 2013 NWSL championship and is home to the extremely popular Alex Morgan — and it makes sense why this time currently finds itself with a valuation of $185 million.

<h2>3. Houston Dynamo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_842939" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Houston-Dynamo-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842939 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Houston-Dynamo-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brad Davis of Houston Dynamo waits for a ball" width="757" height="481" /></a> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current value</span>: $200 million</li>
</ul>
The Houston Dynamo are currently on the outside of the 2015 MLS playoff picture. However, as we’ve seen before, that doesn’t always translate to a loss in value. In fact, not only did the club move into BBVA Compass Stadium in 2012 — a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elllf/3-houston-dynamo/" target="_blank">$95 million project that was almost two-thirds financed by the team</a> — but it also saw a 2014 revenue of $26 million and a 2014 operating income of $5 million. When all these things are taken into consideration, Houston has the Dynamo currently valued at $200 million.

<h2>2. Los Angeles Galaxy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_842941" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Galaxy-Kevork-Djansezian-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842941 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Galaxy-Kevork-Djansezian-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Giovani Dos Santos #10 of the Los Angeles Galaxy congratulates Gyasi Zardes #11 after he scored a goal" width="757" height="610" /></a> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current value</span>: $240 million</li>
</ul>
With 46 points overall, the Los Angeles Galaxy currently sit atop the Western Conference and have the best record in all of Major League Soccer. As one of the founding members of the league, the Galaxy have had success on the field and popularity off of it. As a result, the money as followed. Los Angeles brought in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elllf/2-los-angeles-galaxy/" target="_blank">$44 million in 2014 revenue</a> and had an operating income of $4 million. Throw in the new 10-year, $44 million shirt deal with Herbalife and a local media agreement with Time-Warner that pays an average of $5.5 million a year, and it’s clear why this team is crushing it to the tune of $240 million.

<h2>1. Seattle Sounders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_842946" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Seattle-Sounders-Drew-Hallowell-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-842946 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Seattle-Sounders-Drew-Hallowell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Seattle Sounders celebrate winning the 2014 U.S. Open Cup" width="757" height="504" /></a> Drew Hallowell/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Current value</span>: $245 million</li>
</ul>
The <a href="http://www.soundersfc.com/" target="_blank">Seattle Sounders</a> are on the inside of the playoff picture by the smallest of margins. Yet, in terms of the value of Major League Soccer teams, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elllf/1-seattle-sounders/" target="_blank">they’re second to none</a>. This club averages 40,000 people per game — the highest attendance in the league — had $50 million in revenue in 2014 and an operating income of $10 million. The Sounders are also fortunate enough to have Clint Dempsey putting on a show each and every time he steps onto the pitch. All of the above translate into a current valuation worth $245 million.

It’s safe to say Seattle knows soccer.

Soccer, or football, or whatever name it has in a particular plot of land on the planet, is the world’s most popular sport. Bar none. Speculating about the reasons for its enduring universal appeal is certainly fun, and while we’re of the opinion that it has to do with the limited equipment needed to actually play a game, that’s a whole different story in and of itself. What’s beyond a shadow of a doubt is the fact that if you know anything at all about professional sports, and anything at all about soccer, you know that these guys have what might be referred to as “serious earning potential,” which is to say they can get paid very, very well.

But how does that equate across all the leagues? Unlike, say, American football, which has one very definitive professional league (the NFL) and a host of smaller semi-pro and amateur organizations, soccer is worldwide. There’s top tier leagues in England, Spain, and France, and all of them are competitive enough that they consistently capture the best talent, and can each make an argument for being the greatest league on Earth — a claim that would sound ridiculous coming from, say, the Chinese Basketball Association. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a> went around and determined the average income for every player in the biggest leagues, so here are are the five highest average paying leagues in the wide world of soccer.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>5. Ligue 1, France, $1,544,860<strong>
</strong></h2>
The highest level of soccer in France, Ligue 1 (and its counterpart, the lower division Ligue 2) has been around since the early 1930s, and features clubs from all across the country. They are also pretty friendly with their finances, as the average Ligue 1 player makes about $1.5 million a year — we should note that the Daily Mail originally reported these figures in pounds sterling, so it’s possible that the exchange rate could shuffle a little bit between their research and when you read this. Don’t panic.

<h2>4. La Liga, Spain $1,896,775<strong>
</strong></h2>
It’s hard to think of a league that has more star power than La Liga — Spain’s top tier of competition — since they’ve got what feels like a monopoly on players who could be in the conversation for “best player alive right now,” but they’re only grading out as fourth when it comes to the average contract. Maybe La Liga doesn’t care about the little man, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/" target="_blank">to invoke Homer Stokes</a>.

<h2>3. Serie A, Italy, $2,054,170<strong>
</strong></h2>
Although they have perhaps lost some luster in the eyes of international competition compared to their peers, the venerable Italian league Serie A, also known as one of the most established soccer organizations of all time, insofar as their place in the history of the sport and international competition, still know how to pay their players appropriately. Which is to say, better than a lot of their contemporaries.

<h2>2. Bundesliga, Germany $2,277,594<strong>
</strong></h2>
If there was ever a soccer club that caused neophytes to have to seriously commit to learning how to spell something, it was Bundesliga. The German league arguably had the best showing in the World Cup, as far as their players are concerned, particularly considering the current roster of <a href="http://www.iffhs.de/club-world-ranking/" target="_blank">the best club in the world </a>right now, Bayern Munich. No, we don’t have helpful mnemonic devices for either of those. Sorry.

1. Premier League, UK $3,554,666<strong>
</strong>

The Daily Mail <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2833020/Premier-League-wages-dwarf-Europe-flight-players-England-earning-average-2-3million-year.html" target="_blank">started off their piece</a> with  this interesting factoid, that “<span id="ext-gen147">Premier League footballers earn £2.3 million a year each on average, or £43,717 a week, giving them wages almost 60% higher in 2014 than their closest earnings rivals in Germany’s Bundesliga.</span>” If you’re curious as to how much <span id="ext-gen147">£43,717</span> is in USD, by the way, it’s $68,373. Not a bad chunk of change for a week’s worth of work, we figure.
