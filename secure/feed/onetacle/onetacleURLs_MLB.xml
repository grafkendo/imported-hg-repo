In any level of sports, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-unbreakable-records.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">records are made to be broken</a>. When it comes to baseball, aka America’s pastime, however, several records have stood the test of time. The way today’s big leaguers play the game is vastly different than the style of play during every other era of Major League Baseball. A great example of this is the way pitchers are treated today versus <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pitchers-carried-teams-world-series.html/">the way pitchers were treated</a> during the early years of Major League Baseball.

As baseball players continue to evolve and grow to be bigger, faster, and stronger than ever before, records will continue to fall. With that being said, it’s becoming more and more rare to see players have long enough careers to seriously challenge the records set by their predecessors. In fact, we compiled a list of 10 Major League Baseball records that will stand the test of time. Here’s what we came up with.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Most career saves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804186" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804186 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mariano-Rivera.jpg" alt="Mariano Rivera pitches." width="757" height="507" /> Mariano Rivera pitches. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 652
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Mariano Rivera

Rivera is the <a title="Mariano Rivera Final Game at Yankee Stadium" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTX-4TZp8Mg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest closer in MLB history</a> by a margin wider than the Grand Canyon. He broke Trevor Hoffman’s career saves record in September 2013 before retiring with 652 career saves following the 2014 season. The active career saves leader is Joe Nathan with 377. Given the fact that Nathan has already celebrated his 40th birthday, he will never realistically <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/mariano-rivera/">challenge Rivera’s record</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Most career no-hitters</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804195" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804195 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nolan-Ryan.jpg" alt="Nolan Ryan attempts a no-hitter. " width="757" height="507" /> Nolan Ryan attempts a no-hitter. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  7
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Nolan Ryan
<h2>3. Most career strikeouts</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 5,714
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Nolan Ryan

Baseball fans will likely never see another pitcher like Ryan in their lifetimes. The Ryan Express dominated the Big Leagues for most of his 27-year career, racking up several MLB records during that time. The two that we believe will stand the test of time are his career strikeouts record and his record for the most career no-hitters.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Most career hits</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804197" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-804197 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Pete-Rose.jpg" alt="Pete Rose greets fans at a Cincinnati Reds game." width="500" height="696" /> Pete Rose greets fans at a Cincinnati Reds game. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 4,256
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Pete Rose

Love him or <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/slideshows/most-hated-athletes-of-all-time/">hate him</a>, Rose was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-first-basemen-ever-play-game.html/">one heck of a baseball player</a>. The reality of the situation is that it’s extremely unlikely that there will ever be a player who can even approach his career hits record. The active career leader is 39-year-old Alex Rodriguez, and he is currently 1,285 hits behind Rose. For some perspective on the situation, Rodriguez would need at least six more seasons of 200-plus hits to even come close to Charlie Hustle’s career record.

<h2>5. Most consecutive games played</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804239" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-804239 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cal-Ripkin-Jr.-.jpg" alt="Cal Ripkin Jr. waves his hat at fans." width="500" height="667" /> Cal Ripkin Jr. waves his hat at fans. | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 2,632
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Cal Ripken Jr.

This may be the most impressive and unbreakable record in all of professional sports. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-shortstops-to-ever-play-in-the-mlb.html/">Ripkin’s</a> consecutive games played streak equates to just over 16 full MLB seasons without missing a game.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Longest hitting streak</h2>
[caption id="attachment_804261" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804261 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Joe-DiMaggio.jpg" alt="Joe DiMaggio hits one toward the fences." width="757" height="574" /> Joe DiMaggio hits one toward the fences. | Keystone/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 56 games
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Joe DiMaggio

This record won’t be broken anytime soon. In today’s day and age, it’s incredibly rare to see a hitting streak reach 20 or 30 games, let alone 40 or 50. This record has stood for over 70 years; <a title="Baseball's Unbreakable Record" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=6539812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to research from ESPN</a>, only three players since World War II have come within 21 games of DiMaggio’s record.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Most wins by a pitcher in a single season</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxMivQZDTns?rel=0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 59
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Old Hoss Radbourn

There isn’t much to say here. Current MLB pitchers don’t even come close to getting 59 starts in a season. Just for reference, a starting pitcher in today’s game could realistically win three straight Cy Young awards and not total 59 wins.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Most complete games by a pitcher in a single season</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526228 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MLB-Logo.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> This record will never be broken | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 75
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Will White

See above statement regarding most wins in a single season. This record will never be broken. In fact nobody will ever come close.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Most career stolen bases</h2>
[caption id="attachment_548174" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-548174" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-51717228.jpg" alt="Rickey Henderson of the San Diego Padres prepares t" width="757" height="523" /> Rickey Henderson of the San Diego Padres | Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 1,406
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Rickey Henderson

Henderson has almost 500 more stolen bases than Lou Brock, the next closest player on the career stolen bases list, and 916 more than Ichiro, the active leader. As it stands, there isn’t a player in professional baseball with a realistic chance at overtaking Henderson’s record. This record will stand for the foreseeable future.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Most career wins by a pitcher</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qrz1kidheOM?rel=0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Record</span>: 511
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Held by</span>: Cy Young

Young is the namesake for the highest single-season honor a pitcher can receive <span class="s1">-- </span>and rightfully so. We may never see another 300-game winner in our lifetime, which makes this record untouchable.

		<description><![CDATA[For the Cubs to make it to the 2017 World Series, the team needs a new plan. This is our take on the Chicago Cubs' 2017 projected starting lineup.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_721930" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721930" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Kris-Bryant_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="The Chicago Cubs' 2017 Projected Starting Lineup" width="757" height="504" /> Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs celebrates after winning 8-7 in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

For the World Champion <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/celebrities-root-chicago-cubs.html/">Chicago Cubs</a>, the paint is still wet on the magical landscape that is the 2016 season. However, it's not too early to think about next year. Comments from the peanut gallery aside, the seven-game series against the Indians exposed a few weaknesses <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-biggest-blunders-2016-world-series.html/">the Cubs must correct</a> in order for the Windy City winners to build a dynasty. If not for Kyle Schwarber's rather miraculous comeback, this story <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/chokes-chicago-cubs-postseason-history.html/">may look quite different</a>.

To fix holes in the team's lineup and pitching staff, we'll see some changes by the time the champs head to Arizona for Spring Training 2017. As <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/kyle-schwarber-to-bat-second-in-cubs-new-lineup-for-game-6-110116">Fox's broadcast analyst</a> pointed out, the batting order "lengthened" once Chicago injected Schwarber into the order. In other words, if the last two games took place in the National League park without a DH, the folks in Cleveland would be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/celebrities-root-cleveland-indians.html/">ones celebrating right now</a>. In fact, in order to repeat next season, the Cubs' lineup needs to look more traditional. Let's start with a few assumptions before building the perfect one-though-nine batting order.
<h2>1. Dexter Fowler will not return</h2>
[caption id="attachment_627959" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-627959 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DexterFowlerChicagoCubsvArizonaDiamondbacksHsoJpEZpLg7l.jpg" alt="The Chicago Cubs' 2017 Projected Starting Lineup" width="757" height="500" /> The Chicago Cubs' Dexter Fowler swings for the fences | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

At $8 million for the 2016 season, the Georgia native was a bargain. Considering the field of available free-agent outfielders, Dexter Fowler's value on the open market is far more than the Cubs should pay. Let some other teams use fool's gold to bring Fowler to their outfield. While the Cubs' center fielder has good OBP numbers, he lacks in runs scored and stolen bases -- two essential stats for the optimal leadoff hitter. Also, his 124 strikeouts are far too many for a top-of-the-order table setter.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jason Heyward will be much better than in 2016</h2>
[caption id="attachment_721930" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721930" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-531373448.jpg" alt="The Chicago Cubs' 2017 Projected Starting Lineup" width="757" height="504" /> Jason Heyward of the Chicago Cubs considers his future | Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

Analysts loved discussing J-Hey's inspired <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/jason-heyward-crying-cubs-and-the-best-rain-delay-of-all-time/">rain-delay team meeting</a>, but getting timely hits in the postseason -- not to mention the regular season -- would've proved more valuable. Any way you look at his 2016 numbers, they are awful. The worst of the worst stats involve Heyward's seven homers and wretched .306 OBP. Keep in mind, the 27-year-old former Braves star has experienced off years before (2011, 2013), but he's never had back-to-back off years.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. The pitching staff will look different</h2>
[caption id="attachment_721930" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721930" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aroldis-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Chicago Cubs' 2017 Projected Starting Lineup" width="757" height="504" /> Aroldis Chapman of the Chicago Cubs reacts after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLCS | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Aroldis Chapman is a free agent. Despite his triple-digit fastball, he will not be worth what he could command on the open market. That money is better spent getting a solid backup catcher; David Ross is retiring and Miguel Montero is not worth the $14 million salary due next season. Plenty of teams could use a veteran backstop -- well at least one whose offensive skills and leadership outweigh his defensive liabilities.

The Cubs' neither-fish-nor-fowl pitchers involve a lot of former starters turned middle relievers. In that realm, we include Carl Edwards, Jr., Justin Grimm, and Mike Montgomery. Shipping off some of their excess pitching could land some utility players who give the team more infield depth.
This leads to the 2017 lineup.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>The Chicago Cubs' projected starting lineup</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695918" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-603016298.jpg" alt="The Chicago Cubs' 2017 Projected Starting Lineup" width="757" height="466" /> Anthony Rizzo (L) and Addison Russell celebrate a two-run homer | Richard Carson/Getty Images[/caption]

The biggest challenge facing the Cubs will be at leadoff. We assume that Albert Almora, Jr. will replace Fowler in center field, and he is not suited to bat first. Almora's OBP is in the low .300s and he has anemic stolen base totals. The best solution for leadoff (hold your laughter<span class="s1">) is</span> a more recognizable Jason Heyward. His three previous seasons -- ones before the 2016 disaster -- had him with OBP in the .350 range and a decent number of steals and an OK strikeout-to-walk ratio.

As the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/major-injury-comebacks-in-pro-sports.html/">World Series proved</a>, Schwarber needs to bat second. That puts <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-highest-selling-mlb-jerseys.html/">Kris Bryant</a> batting third and Anthony Rizzo fourth. This gives you a nice left-right-left order that puts the opposition in a tough late-inning position. Given Addison Russell's progression, he deserves the fifth slot, which would add a power right-handed bat behind Rizzo and give the first baseman some protection. Yes, Russell ahead of Zobrist, a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-players-world-series-winners-leagues.html/">World Series hero</a> whose power numbers are on the wane.

After Zobrist, the Contreras/Baez combo is a tossup. Javier Baez does not deserve to bat this low in the lineup (for that matter neither does Contreras). However, until the young infielder learns better plate discipline, his liabilities at the plate are fairly significant. Truth be told, if Baez learns to be more selective at the plate, he'd be a great leadoff man. His 108 whiffs to 15 walks might say otherwise, but the talented Puerto Rico-native has top-of-the-order in him; whether it comes out is another story.

Such a lineup does speak to the fact we have no obvious spot for Almora if he took over center field. Such a logjam means either the Cubs platoon Heyward and Almora or Heyward plays center with Schwarber in left and Zobrist in right. As the best right fielder on the team, Heyward presents lineup problems in which defense is sacrificed for the offense. The offseason, especially the Winter Meetings, will clear up the final lineup issues.

Clearly, Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer know what they're doing.

		<description><![CDATA[Alfonso Soriano, who recently retired from baseball, ranks 50th in MLB history for most career home runs. Here are the names still above him in the record books.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_721338" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721338 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/170825158-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

When veteran slugger Alfonso Soriano <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11823539/alfonso-soriano-says-retiring-baseball-lost-love-passion-play" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his retirement</a> from baseball in 2014, after playing 16 years in the major leagues, his 412 home runs were just good enough to crack the top 50 in MLB history. Of course, baseball is nothing if not remorseless, and Soriano has already ceded his top 50 spot to Adrian Beltre, who sits at #50 with 413. As a result, we decided it was time to revist the record books to see which big names — 49 of them, if you’re scoring at home — are sitting above Beltre and Soriano as of now.
<h2>49. Darrell Evans, 414</h2>
Darrell Evans played in the big leagues from 1969 to 1989, leading the majors with 40 home runs in 1985. His career best was 41 dingers in the 1973 season.
<h2>48. Billy Williams, 426</h2>
Longtime Cub Billy Williams hit 392 of his 426 homers for Chicago, including a career-high 42 in 1970.
<h2>47. Mike Piazza, 427</h2>
Mike Piazza hit 35 or more home runs six times in his MLB career, starting with his Rookie of the Year season for the Dodgers in 1993.
<h2>46. Cal Ripken, 431</h2>
When you play in 2,632 games in a row, the law of averages says you’re going to hit your share of homers. That was the case for two-time MVP Cal Ripken Jr.

<h2>45. Juan Gonzalez, 434 (tie)</h2>
Juan Gonzalez amassed five different seasons with 40 home runs and at least 100 RBI between 1992 and 1998, winning the AL MVP in 1996 and 1998 as a result.
<h2>45. Andruw Jones, 434 (tie)</h2>
Three hundred and sixty-eight of Andruw Jones’s home runs came in an Atlanta Braves uniform, highlighted by a 51 HR campaign in 2005.
<h2>43. Andre Dawson, 438</h2>
1987 National League MVP Andre Dawson hit 49 home runs and drove in 137 runs that season, his first with the Cubs after more than a decade in Montreal.
<h2>42. Paul Konerko, 439</h2>
Paul Konerko played the final 16 seasons of his career with the White Sox, hitting 20 or more home runs in 13 of them.
<h2>41. Jason Giambi, 440</h2>
From 2000 to 2003, Jason Giambi (pictured) hit 163 blasts over a four-year span, taking home the MVP award in 2000 as a result. Does he have another year left?

<h2>40. Dave Kingman, 442</h2>
Dave Kingman hit home runs for seven different ballclubs in the 1970s and ’80s, led by a 48 HR output for the Cubs in 1979.
<h2>39. Jeff Bagwell, 449 (tie)</h2>
1994 National League MVP Jeff Bagwell played 15 seasons for the Astros and hit at least 15 homers in each of the first 14.
<h2>39. Vladimir Guerrero, 449 (tie)</h2>
Vladimir Guerrero (pictured) hit 38 or more dingers five times in a seven-year span (1998 to 2004), culminating in his ’04 American League MVP award with Anaheim.
<h2>37. Carl Yastrzemski, 452</h2>
“Yaz” played 23 seasons, all with the same team, and hit plenty of home runs in the process. He blasted a career-high 44 as the American League MVP in 1967.
<h2>36. Jose Canseco, 462 (tie)</h2>
Jose Canseco had plenty of prolific slugging seasons, but 1988 will go down in history: The A’s star stole 40 bases to go with his 42 round-trippers.

		<description><![CDATA[Here are the 10 MLB players who got into the Hall of Fame with the highest vote percentages. Spoiler: Babe Ruth didn't make the cut.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every former <a title="MLB" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/category/sports-2/mlb/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> player entering the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown needs at least 75% of the vote from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) or a committee from one of the three eras (formerly one body known as the Veterans Committee). Most baseball fans understand this process as the method of inducting a player into the Hall, but after that the logic gets confusing.

No player has ever been voted unanimously into the <a title="Baseball Hall of Fame" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/baseball-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> -- not even Babe Ruth himself. In fact, the 2014 class included one star pitcher who knocked the Bambino a bit farther down the list. Still, no mortal has ever cracked 99%, though Tom Seaver has gone on the record saying Derek Jeter <a title="Should Derek Jeter Be the First Unanimous Hall of Famer?" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/should-derek-jeter-be-the-first-unanimous-hall-of-famer.html/" target="_blank">ought to go in unanimously</a>. Only the BBWAA scribes could bestow such an honor on anyone. For now, here are the 10 highest vote-getters by percentile in the Hall of Fame voting history.
<h2>10. Johnny Bench</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680333" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680333" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/452892510-640x415.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="491" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

Runners had to choose wisely when trying to steal on Johnny Bench, one of the greatest catchers in the game’s history. He won ten Gold Gloves, two MVPs, the Rookie of the Year award, World Series MVP, and was named to over a dozen All Star games. Voters agreed that there were few folks more deserving than the Little General, who hauled in 96.42% of the vote in 1989.

What is there to say about the sixteen voters out of 437 who didn’t vote for Bench on his first Hall of Fame ballot? It is impossible to guess, but it is a tradition as old as the Hall itself, when Babe Ruth went into the original class at Cooperstown with 95.13 perent. That meant eleven voters of 226 didn’t consider the Babe fit for enshrinement.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Mike Schmidt</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680346" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680346" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/51989217-640x462.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="546" /> Mark D. Phillips/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Michael Jack Schmidt, as Phillies announcer Harry Kalas used to call him, has stats that will stand up to just about any player in MLB history. Schmidt won three MVP awards, nine Gold Gloves, and six Silver Slugger awards (given to the best offensive player at each position). He led the National League in home runs eight times, finishing with 548 HR for his career. Sure, he should have been unanimous, but Schmidt’s 96.52% (444 of 460) rank him ninth in the history of Hall voting.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Greg Maddux</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680357" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680357" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/51543250-640x499.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="590" /> Tony Ranze/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Fans of Mike Schmidt’s old teammate Steve Carlton might wonder where the lefty went among the top ten. In fact, Greg Maddux bumped the southpaw out of the top ten when he nabbed the eighth-best voting percentile of all time as a member of the 2014 class. The Professor notched 97.2% of votes from the BBWAA. Maddux beguiled a generation of MLB hitters on his way to 355 wins (eighth all time), a product of winning at least fifteen games for seventeen consecutive seasons. Along the way, he nabbed four Cy Young awards, led the league in games started seven times and innings pitched five times.

One might say Maddux could field his position as well: He won eighteen Gold Gloves in his career, which is the most in baseball history. Send in The Professor unanimously? He certainly deserved it, but it didn’t happen. At least ten voters didn’t consider Maddux worthy.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Tony Gwynn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680378" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680378" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/75852144-1-640x427.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="505" /> Chris McGrath/Getty Images[/caption]

It would be tough to find a classier, more popular baseball player than the late Tony Gwynn (1960-2014), and it would be harder to find one who could hit in the same league as Mr. Padre. Gwynn won eight batting titles in his career (including one with a .394 average in 1994) and five Gold Gloves. He ended with a .338 career average in his spectacular twenty-year career. That wasn’t enough to persuade all Hall voters, however. Gwynn notched 97.61% of the vote in 2007, which meant thirteen of the 545 voters left him off the ballot.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Hank Aaron</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680381" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680381" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/51620547-640x430-2.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="508" /> Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s almost pointless to list Hank Aaron’s mind-boggling statistics. Most baseball fans know the number 755 — Aaron’s home run total — by the time they hit five years old. In fact, the majority of fans consider that number the all-time record. Regardless, Aaron has the most total bases (6,856) and most RBI (2,297) in history, so it’s possible to leave home runs aside in the conversation. He was an All Star in 21 of his 23 MLB seasons.

The man who topped Babe Ruth’s home run record and touched more bases than anyone in history was not voted unanimously into the Hall of Fame? Actually, he wasn’t. Aaron nabbed 97.83% of the vote, meaning he failed to sway nine of the 415 voters in 1982.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. George Brett</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680382" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-680382" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/51589764-640x467.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="756" height="552" /> Tony Ranze/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Perennial All Star, 1980 AL MVP, 1990 batting champ and career .305 hitter (369 OBP), George Brett has a resume as deep as any players in the history of the game, yet since the first writers didn’t vote for Ruth or Cobb, it was predictable that a few would leave Brett off the ballot when he came up for Hall of Fame election in 1999. However, Brett’s 98.19% still stands as the fifth highest in history. Concerning the nine voters of 497 who didn’t vote for Brett, they are lucky the gamer didn’t reenact the Pine Tar Incident from Yankee Stadium.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Ty Cobb</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680386" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680386" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/497371-640x425.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="503" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Tyrus Raymond Cobb, the Georgia Peach, was arguably the greatest baseball player ever — better than Ruth, some of his contemporaries said. Cobb’s .366 lifetime average is still the top mark in history, and the only player with more than his 4,189 hits is not in the Hall of Fame. So Cobb stands alone in the 4,000 club in the Hall after all these years. In his heyday, he was the fiercest competitor the game had ever seen, and did what he could to win at any cost. Cobb may not have been a great human being, but he was an exquisite baseball player.

In the Hall’s first vote ever in 1936, four of the 226 voters left Cobb off their ballots, which gave him 98.23% of the vote. Still, Cobb must have been satisfied he beat Ruth, who only pulled in 95.13% of the vote (now twelfth all time). Those four voters who didn’t vote for Cobb — and the even that didn’t vote for Ruth — probably eliminated the possibility of a unanimous vote for any player heading into the MLB Hall of Fame.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Cal Ripken, Jr.</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680387" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680387" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/52023351-640x510.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="603" /> Ted Mathias/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Like Tony Gwynn, who entered the Hall in his class, Cal Ripken, Jr. was one of the most likable players in modern baseball. His greatest accomplishment — the 2,632 consecutive games he played — will never be broken and marks one of the high points of the past twenty years for fans of the sport. Ripken’s work ethic and class were on another level, even among some Hall of Famers. When he came up for election in 2007, only eight of the 545 voters could stand to withhold Cal’s name from the ballot, which gave him 98.53%, third best in history. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Nolan Ryan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680389" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680389" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/53011339-640x426.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="504" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

With Nolan Ryan, there’s only one stat most fans need: 5,714 strikeouts, the most in baseball history. The Ryan Express blew away so many opposing battters that it’s impossible to fathom. He also holds the record with seven no-hitters, in addition to 12 one-hitters (tied for most). His record (324-292) and ERA (3.19) don’t tell half the story. When Ryan was elected into the Hall with 98.79% of the vote in 1999, only six voters of 497 didn’t include him on their ballots.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. To<strong>m Seaver</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_680390" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680390" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/53011408-640x428.jpg" alt="MLB: Top 10 Players Who Easily Made It Into the Hall of Fame" width="757" height="506" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Not even Tom Terrific entered the Hall with a perfect score. However, Seaver notched the highest percentage of all time from the BBWAA when he garnered 98.84% in 1992. Of 430 voters, five didn’t vote yes on Seaver’s first ballot. The NL Rookie of the Year in 1967 and three-time Cy Young winner, Seaver is twentieth all-time with 110.5 Wins Against Replacement (WAR).

He led the NL in ERA three times and in strikeouts five times, compiling a 311-205 career record. His most spectacular years were spent for the Mets, but Seaver was popular with the entire baseball world. If Mr. Met could not go in unanimously (forget Cobb or Ruth), will anyone ever get the honor? At this point in time, it seems like a stretch.

While he's no longer rocking pinstripes on a regular basis, it's hard to think about the New York Yankees and not turn your attention to the great Derek Jeter. Even after his retirement from <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major League Baseball</a> in 2014, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/derek-jeter-and-the-history-of-yankees-captains.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">captain of all captains</a> continues to remain a permanent fixture in the city with which he spent his entire career. And really, that shouldn't be a surprise. That's usually what happens when you're an all-time great shortstop.

Throughout his incredible career, Jeter showed himself to be one of the greatest shortstops to ever step on a diamond. While there have been better offensive shortstops, and better defensive shortstops, no one equaled his impressive balance of offense and defense. Which is why we feel the need to compile this particular list. Therefore, with that in mind, here's a look the five best all-around shortstops to ever play the game from the bottom to the top, taking into account more than any single facet of the game.
<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">5. Ernie Banks</span></h2>
Playing the more defensive-minded shortstop position, Banks wasn’t expected to produce tons of runs. Yet, he did exactly that. He’s one of just 25 players ever in the MLB to hit 500 career home runs, and he did that all while wearing a Chicago Cubs jersey for his entire <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bankser01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-year tenure from 1953–71</a>. Although he played first base toward the end of his career, Banks would go down as one of the best (and first) power-hitting shortstops ever. During the peak of his career, he won back-to-back MVP awards, which all but set his legacy in stone. It is also worth noting that Banks was the first African-American player on the Cubs' roster.

<h2>4. Ozzie Smith</h2>

Where Banks was known for his offense, Ozzie Smith was known for his legendary defense. His <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smithoz01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.978 fielding percentage</a> is one of the best the game has ever seen. The ease with which Smith moved around the infield and made almost impossible plays look easy is a quality that set him apart from even the best infielders. In 19 MLB seasons, he played for two different teams and racked up 13 Gold Gloves at the position.

Whereas some shortstops are hindrances to a team’s batting order (see Adam Everett) because they’re needed more for their defense, that wasn’t the case for Smith. Sure, he didn’t have the most powerful bat in the league — he still managed to leave baseball with a .262 batting average, and an average of 50 RBIs per every 162 games played. Again, he didn’t wow you with his bat, but put that next to his wizardry at shortstop, and there wasn’t a team out there that wouldn’t have signed Smith in a heartbeat.

<h2>3. Cal Ripken Jr.</h2>
[caption id="attachment_537173" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-537173 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Cal-Ripkin-Jr.-.jpg" alt="BALTIMORE, MD - DECEMBER 1: (YEARENDER 16) Cal Ripken, Jr., of the Baltimore Orioles, tips his hat to the fans in the middle of the fifth inning at Camden Yards in Baltimore 06 September after setting the record of 2,131 consecutive games played.

Cal Ripken Jr., while mostly known for his league-record 2,632 consecutive games played, was still one of the greatest shortstops ever. In 21 years in the majors, he played only for the Baltimore Orioles — an impressive feat. Maybe not the league’s best fielding shortstop, his ability to hit for power and average easily made up for any defensive deficiencies (albeit he won two gold gloves in 1991 and 1992, so his defense was well above subpar.)

Similar to Banks, Ripken was a power hitter, especially for a shortstop at that time. He won two MVP awards, was a <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ripkeca01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19-time All-Star</a>, and won eight Silver Slugger awards (given to the best offensive player at each position.) Playing at a time when it mattered much more for a shortstop to be good on defense than good at the plate, Ripken helped change the position. Oh yeah, and he also accrued a ridiculous 3,184 career hits and 431 career home runs.

<h2>2. Derek Jeter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_484269" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-484269" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Derek-Jeter-2-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Derek Jeters runs after a hit. | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The most recently retired player on this list, Jeter will assuredly be in the Hall of Fame when he’s eligible in 2020. Ever since his first season with the Yankees in 1995 where he won the AL Rookie of the Year award, Jeter has won the hearts of New Yorkers with his glove and bat. Sure, he has never won the league’s MVP award, but that’s because Jeter wasn’t a power hitter; rather he was a contact hitter with an impressive <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jeterde01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.310 career batting average</a>.</span>

Defensively, Jeter was a rock in New York for almost two decades. Some players on this list switched positions later in their careers as a result of age and becoming too slow to man the middle of the infield -- that’s not the case for Jeter, the Yankees’ field general through and through. While he wasn’t known for driving in a lot of runs or being the best hitter in the game (though his 3,465 career hits speaks for his consistency), when the postseason rolled around, he never failed to amaze. Which, as a result, only adds to his overall greatness.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Honus Wagner</h2>
Wagner played for 20 seasons as a baseball player between the years 1897 and 1917 — making him by far the oldest player on this list. It’s difficult to compare a player from that era to even one from the 1990s because the game was so different, yet Wagner’s numbers don’t lie. The guy had serious game.

He finished his career with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wagneho01.shtml">3,420 career hits,</a> had 1,733 RBIs, and won eight batting titles. When you consider that Wagner was playing in the <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Deadball_Era">dead ball era</a> where RBIs and home runs were rarities, his numbers are that much more impressive — and also the reason that he is at the top of this list.

		<description><![CDATA[Major League Baseball has seen its fair share of all-time great catchers. Here's a look at the 6 best individuals to ever play the position.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_825318" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-825318 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Johnny-Bench-Kirk-Irwin-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="504" /> Johnny Bench | Kirk Irwin/Getty Images[/caption]

As it is in most pro sports, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> used the 2015 All-Star Game to create a special moment for both the fans in attendance and those watching from home. Not only did legendary hurler Sandy Koufax <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/redsblog/2015/07/14/sandy-koufax-all-star-game-ceremonial-first-pitch-johnny-bench/30167215/" target="_blank">throw out the first pitch</a>, but a 67-year-old Hall of Famer -- and former Cincinnati Reds great -- by the name of Johnny Bench (pictured above) was the man at the plate to catch it. History meet history.

Bench’s presence was part of the “<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/07/mlb-greatest-living-ballplayers-koufax-mays-aaron-bench-bonds?utm_source=feedblitz&amp;utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&amp;utm_campaign=usatodaycomsports-topstories" target="_blank">Greatest Living Players</a>” campaign that the MLB orchestrated for the event. And it was even more special because the Hall of Famer just so happened to play his entire career with Cincinnati, where the game was being held. Bench was a special player because he epitomized what every catcher wanted to be: Good at the plate and also behind it.

He wasn’t the first great catcher to come, though. There were others before him, and there were others after him. What makes the catcher so unique among the other positions isn’t that it necessarily takes more skill, or even that the constant crouching really accentuates the everyday wear and tear MLB players face.

Great catchers are so difficult to find because it takes a unique skill set to succeed defensively and offensively. That’s why, in the present day, it’s much more common to see either a talented defensive catcher who’s average at the plate or a power-hitting catcher who struggles to keep base runners at bay. Needless to say, when a catcher reaches a triple-threat level -- hitting for average, power, and good defense behind the plate -- it’s a rarity. Everyone on this list reached that status during their careers, making them the six greatest catchers ever.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Mike Piazza</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743317" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743317" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Mike-Piazza-mets-e1420640577406.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="551" /> Former Mets players Tom Seaver (R) and Mike Piazza greet fans. | Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

The power-hitting Mike Piazza -- a <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof.shtml" target="_blank">member of the 2016 Hall of Fame class</a> --  played for 17 years with various teams. Despite finishing his career having appeared for five different clubs, his ability to hit the ball never faded. Though he wasn’t as elite behind the plate as some of these other guys, his offense by far made up for it.

He appeared in 12 All-Star Games and finished runner-up in the MVP vote twice. His 427 home runs tops all catchers in baseball’s storied history, and his ability as a catcher to hit for power separated him from the other elite catchers of his time.

<h2>5. Carlton Fisk</h2>
[caption id="attachment_825326" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-825326 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Carlton-Fisk-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="496" /> Hall of Fame catcher (2003 inductee) Gary Carter talks to Hall of Fame catcher (2000) Carlton Fisk. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Carlton Fisk, known for his longevity, played from 1971 to 1993. During his 24-year career (longer than a lot of current MLB players have been alive), he played in 11 All-Star Games and won his lone Gold Glove during his rookie campaign in 1972.

However, with his longevity came some impressive stats, like <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fiskca01.shtml" target="_blank">2,356 career hits</a>, the most for any catcher ever. And the fact that he appeared in an All-Star Game in three consecutive decades. Despite Fisk’s offensive numbers waning as he aged, he still managed to make a difference on the diamond in his mid-40s, and that’s enough to get him on this list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 4. Bill Dickey</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvcfLeuknJM"></iframe>

Bill Dickey played with the Yankees for his entire career, some of it spanned the beginning of New York’s Golden Age in the late 1920s. During his career, Dickey coupled his impressive longevity with enduring talent. His tenure with the Yankees (from 1928-1943, plus 1946 after he came out of retirement) saw him appear in 11 All-Star Games and also win eight World Series championships. He appeared in 1,789 games for the Pinstripes -- an impressive feat in itself.

Dickey finished his career with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/dickebi01.shtml" target="_blank">.313 batting average and 1,209 RBIs</a>. But his most impressive offensive numbers aren’t necessarily what he did, but what he didn’t do: In more than 7,000 plate appearances, he struck out just 289 times. Coaches will always say “good eye” to players when they don’t swing at a bad pitch. Dickey practically invented that term. On top of being Mr. Consistent at the plate, he also was the Yankees’ defensive anchor during a stretch that has gone down as one of the best ever.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Ivan Rodriguez</h2>
[caption id="attachment_825349" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-825349 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ivan-Rodriguez-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="504" /> Ivan Rodriguez | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Ivan Rodriguez, nicknamed “Pudge,” played from 1991 all the way until 2011. His 21-year career saw him mostly play with the Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers, with a few other teams among those two. He was consistent at the plate -- evidenced by his .296 career batting average -- but the power never really was there, as he had just one season with more than 100 RBIs. That’s a side note, though, because some consider Pudge the greatest defensive catcher ever.

Rodriguez won <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rodriiv01.shtml" target="_blank">13 Gold Gloves and a lone MVP Award in 1999</a>. His talent singlehandedly shifted opposing team’s game plans: Teams couldn’t steal on him, or they’d get caught trying. His commanding presence and smooth arm helped lead the Florida Marlins to the World Series in 2003.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Yogi Berra</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765626" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765626" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Yogi-Berra-640x442.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="523" /> Yogi Berra | Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

Similar to Dickey on this list, Yogi Berra played his entire career (1946-63) with the Yankees. Berra didn’t crush the ball, but he got on base enough to let the big guys behind him do their job. He really made his money defensively. Based on his prowess behind plate, he made <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/berrayo01.shtml" target="_blank">18 consecutive All-Star Game appearances</a>, won three MVPs, and helped lead the Yankees to 10 World Championships along the way.

Though the catcher never gets enough credit for a pitcher’s success -- kind of along the same lines as the offensive line and their quarterback in football -- Berra’s skill and finesse behind the plate made all the difference for the Yankees during a historic stretch.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 1. Johnny Bench</h2>
[caption id="attachment_825353" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-825353" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Johnny-Bench-2-Kirk-Irwin-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 6 Greatest Catchers to Ever Play the Game" width="757" height="504" /> Johnny Bench greets the crowd. | Kirk Irwin/Getty Images[/caption]

Bench’s honor at the All-Star Game was more than deserved. Many consider him to be the greatest all-around catcher in the history of the game, and statistically, a case can certainly be made for that assertion. His <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/benchjo01.shtml" target="_blank">accolades read like a fiction novel</a>: 14 All-Star appearances (though 15 if you count the 2015 event), two NL MVP awards, 10 Gold Gloves, and to top it all off, two World Series titles.

He played every one of his 17 years with the Reds, and along the way tallied 389 career home runs, which is second only to Piazza for most by a catcher. His ability to play two ways is what sets him apart from everybody else. For example, in his two MVP seasons ('70 and '72), he also won a Gold Glove behind the plate, essentially acknowledging that he was a special player in every facet of the game. As far as all-time great catchers are concerned, they broke the mold when they made Johnny Bench.

		<description><![CDATA[Based on Baseball Almanac calculations and tales of yore, here are the 8 best MLB teams of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[To compile a list of the best <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-will-the-nationals-live-up-to-the-hype-this-season.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Major League Baseball</a> teams of all time, there’s more than a century of data to mine and some parameters to set. For one thing, a team can’t be great if they lose in the playoffs. For the Ruth-and-Gehrig Yankees (and every other team before 1969), the postseason simply meant the World Series. The best of the American League played the best of the National League for a winner-take-all best of seven.

Nowadays, there are wild card playoffs followed by Division Series followed by League Championship Series. Teams that survive earn the right to play for all the marbles. Still, the lopsided way teams from decades past won earn them the right to be among the greatest ever.

<a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/best_major_league_teams_ever.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseball Almanac</a> did some fantastic number crunching to come up with a picture of the most dominant teams in the regular season and playoffs. They used winning percentage, percentage of runs scored in any given game (allowing defensive-minded teams to gain weight), playoff record, and earned-run average (ERA) to define their version of “best ever.” Based on Baseball Almanac’s calculations and other tales of epic clubs of yore, here are the eight best MLB teams of all time.
<h2 style="text-align: left">8. 1970 Baltimore Orioles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_806300" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-806300" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-3010583.jpg" alt="American baseball player Jim Palmer holds up his Cy Young award, one of three he won over the course of his career, 1975." width="757" height="507" /> Jim Palmer, who went on to win three Cy Young awards for Baltimore, was the ace of the Orioles staff in 1970. | Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

In the modern era, 100-win seasons are still special achievements, but a club needs to navigate multiple playoff series in order to certify those results with a title. The 1970 Baltimore Orioles posted 108 wins and went 115-55 with their playoff run included. They beat the Reds in five games to cap off a season for the ages that was defined by the Birds’ pitching staff.

Hall of Famer Jim Palmer (20-10, 2.71 ERA, 305.0 IP) led a staff that featured <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BAL/1970.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three 20-game winners</a> in the rotation and a team ERA of 3.15. Big Frank Robinson (.306, 24 HR) and Boog Powell (35 HR, 114 RBI) supplied the power while Paul Blair and Brooks Robinson worked their magic on the field and at the plate. This was Earl Weaver’s best team, one of five 100-win squads skippered by the late Hall of Fame manager but the only one to win the World Series.<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left">7. 1961 New York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527764" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527764 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Yankee-Stadium-H.-William-Tetlow-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Yankee Stadium" width="757" height="601" /> Yankee Stadium | H. William Tetlow/Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

The 1954 New York Giants could have claimed this spot, but the 1961 Yankees’ dominance (109 wins) was simply too much for for teams in their era to handle. Mickey Mantle had a monster season but Roger Maris ended up stealing the headlines by slugging 61 home runs to claim the record from Ruth. Mantle cracked 54 HR and hit .317 with a .448 on base percentage while three other players hit at least 20 homers for this new version of Murderers’ Row.

On the mound, the Chair of the Board ran the show. Whitey Ford went 25-4 in the regular season before pitching 14 scoreless innings in two World Series wins to nab MVP honors. The Yankees beat the Reds in five games, but the outcome was never really in question. Maris’s 61 in ’61 seemed predetermined for this all-time great club.
<h2 style="text-align: left">6. 1929 Philadelphia Athletics</h2>
Back in the day, Philly was a two-team town and the A’s were a dominant force in the American League with Connie Mack as their manager and Shibe Park as their home field. Whether the 1910 club was better than the 1929 squad is debatable, but the latter had to take the AL title from Ruth and Gehrig’s Yankees, so they win the race here. Jimmie Foxx (or, “Double X”) led the charge in ’29, hitting .354 with 33 home runs and a gaudy .463 on-base percentage, but Al Simmons was the team’s beast with 34 dingers and 157 RBI to go along with a .356 batting average. Yeah, they were that good.

The A’s went 104-46 in the regular season, blowing out the second-place Yankees by 18 games (the Red Sox ended up 48 games behind in the standings). On the mound, Lefty Grove (20-6) and George Earnshaw (24-8) combined for 32 complete games. They beat the Cubs in five games to win the World Series as Jimmy Dykes hit .421 and Foxx drove in five for the A’s.

<h2>5. 1939 York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527768" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527768 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Yankees-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="New York Yankees" width="757" height="561" /> 1939 New York Yankees | Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

Based on the 1939 Yankees’ 411 run differential, you could rank them at the top of the list for best team of all time, but they’ll get their due. Bill Dickey, Joe Gordon, and Red Rolfe did plenty of damage that year, but it was Joe DiMaggio’s team. Joltin’ Joe hit .381 with 30 home runs in a Yankee Stadium where fly balls to left field went to die (490 feet to left-center, 415 to left.) The Yankee Clipper had an on-base percentage of .448 and somehow struck out just 20 times in 524 plate appearances.

Red Ruffing paced the pitching staff with 21 wins and 22 complete games. The 1939 World Series against Cincinnati wasn’t even fair. Charlie Keller hit .438 with 3 home runs as the Yankees outscored the Reds 20-8 in a four-game sweep. With the playoffs added in, the 1939 Yankees went 110-45.
<h2><strong>4. 1907 Chicago Cubs</strong></h2>
While there are several stats that make the 1907 Cubs special, the one that catapults off the page is the team’s mind-boggling 1.73 ERA. Even in the Dead Ball Era, this pitching staff defined stingy. They outscored opponents by nearly 200 runs on their way to a record of 107-45.

In the World Series, the 1906 Cubs team that won 116 games got to redeem itself and enter the pantheon of best clubs ever. The pitching staff allowed a total of six runs in five games. How do you manage a four-games-to-none sweep when playing five games? Game One was called off after 12 innings with the teams deadlocked in a 3-3 tie. Yes, baseball was like soccer back then.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. 1976 Cincinnati Reds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527772" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527772 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Cincinatti-Reds-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="1976 Cincinnati Reds" width="757" height="518" /> 1976 Cincinnati Reds | Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

Though one could argue the “Big Red Machine” of 1975 was one of the best ever, that club needed all seven games to win the World Series. That was not the case for the 1976 Reds who swept the Phillies in three games in the NLCS and then manhandled the Yankees in a four-game sweep of the World Series.

Johnny Bench hit .533 in the Series with 6 RBI to take home MVP honors while George Foster and Dave Concepcion added to the onslaught. In the regular season, Joe Morgan, Pete Rose, and Ken Griffey led the offensive juggernaut to 102 wins. Scrappy and scruffy in the way only a 1970s ballclub could be, the Reds of 1976 were fun to watch and one of the game’s greatest.
<h2>2. 1998 New York Yankees</h2>
Take David Wells, David Cone, Andy Pettitte, and Mariano Rivera in their prime. In mid-season, add Cuban sensation Orlando “El Duque” Hernandez. Start the batting order with Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter, then mix in Paul O’Neill, Bernie Williams, and Tino Martinez in high-production years. Round it out with Jorge Posada, Scott Brosius, and Chili Davis. Call in Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton, Graeme Lloyd, and Ramiro Mendoza from the bullpen and DH or pinch-hit Darryl Strawberry when you want to intimidate a pitcher. That’s how the 1998 Yankees went 125-50.

Manager Joe Torre had access to the most talented pool of players in the modern era during the 114-48 regular season. The only vague threat that year came in the playoffs when Cleveland took Game Two of the ALCS at old Yankee Stadium, then roughed up Andy Pettitte to take game three in Cleveland. These were the only two losses the Yankees had in the postseason. El Duque righted the ship with an epic performance in game four before Cone and Wells sealed the deal. The World Series was more like a vacation to San Diego for this team, which took home the trophy in a four-game sweep.

With all this talent, who was the MVP of the World Series? Scott Brosius, whose brutal treatment of Trevor Hoffman in Game Three ended the best closer argument and signifies just how deep the ’98 Yankees were. Joe Torre insisted “Best Ever” go on the World Series ring along with the club’s impossible record. His assessment holds up to objective scrutiny.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>1. 1927 New York Yankees</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_527775" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-527775 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Babe-Ruth-Hulton-Archive-Getty-IMages.jpg" alt=" 1927 New York Yankees" width="757" height="531" /> Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

In a time when the baseball season lasted 154 games, the 1927 Yankees went 110-44. Babe Ruth mashed a record 60 home runs (more than 12 whole teams hit that year) and Lou Gehrig hit .373 with 47 home runs and 52 doubles. Outfielders Earl Combes (.356 BA) and Bob Meusel (.337 BA) combined for 83 doubles. They were called “Murderers’ Row” for a reason.

The 1927 Yankees could also pitch with the best of them. Ace Waite Hoyt went 22-7 with a 2.63 ERA while closer Wilcy Moore chalked up 19 wins out of the bullpen with an ERA of 2.28. Their run differential (number of runs they outscored opponents) was a staggering 376. In the World Series, the Babe hit .400 with seven RBI as the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games. It’s what happens when the best player ever leads the best squad ever against any opponent.

To put Babe Ruth’s achievement in perspective, the World Series opponent Pirates hit 54 home runs as a team in 1927 — six fewer than the Sultan of Swat. No wonder they wanted to put an asterisk next to Maris’s 61.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[There have been many PED controversies in recent years, but these 5 high-profile players linked to the drug scandals have given some attention to the issue.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_505384" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/A-Rod-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505384" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/A-Rod-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Alex Rodriguez" width="757" height="540" /></a> Alex Rodriguez | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

Do you miss Alex Rodriguez? It was easy to forget, particularly when anyone talking about the Yankees was talking about Derek Jeter, but the New York Yankees third baseman was suspended for the entirety of the 2014 season due to his involvement in the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drugs scandal. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-in-ironic-twist-yankees-must-rely-on-a-rod-in-postseason.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">While A-Rod came back for an impressive 2015 campaign</a> before retiring last year, it’s clear the league cannot control doping in the sport, even with harsh penalties against its players.

This problem has highlighted the dishonesty of athletes who want to have an upper hand on their competitors and cheat the game for better statistics and bigger contracts. There’s been a tough debate about how these cases should be handled. For now, the MLB is hitting its players where it hurts: with long suspensions, which also affect them financially.

A-Rod isn’t the first person to be the focus of this type of media storm (although he is probably the only player to come back to an organization that reviled him and actively contribute to their most recent playoff run). There have been many PED controversies in recent years, but these five high-profile players linked to the scandals have given some much-needed attention to the issue. Here, we remember the seedier side of America's pastime. The following list is not ranked in any way.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong>1. Barry Bonds</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505390" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505390" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Barry-Bonds-Andy-Hayt-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="Barry Bonds " width="757" height="606" /> Barry Bonds | Andy Hayt/Getty Images[/caption]

Former San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds was riding high after he broke two previously unbeatable MLB records: most career home runs (762) and most home runs in a single season (73). But when his personal strength trainer from BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative) was indicted by a federal grand jury for supplying steroids to several baseball players, Bonds was forced to testify during the investigation in 2003.

After he repeatedly denied knowing that he took illegal supplements, prosecutors indicted him in 2007 with obstruction of justice and making false statements. Bonds was convicted in 2011 on the obstruction charge, which <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/09/13/barry-bonds-obstruction-of-justice-conviction-upheld/2809745/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was upheld</a> in 2013. As a result, he was sentenced to 30 days of house arrest and two years of probation. Meanwhile, Bonds did not get elected to the MLB Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.
<h2>2. Roger Clemens</h2>
Seven-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens got into deep trouble when his former trainer Brian McNamee testified that he had regularly injected the pitcher with steroids. The testimony was given in the Mitchell Report, an MLB-commissioned inquiry into the use of the illegal drugs in professional baseball.

Clemens denied the allegations under oath before Congress in 2008, saying he never took PEDs. This led a federal grand jury to charge him with six felony counts in 2010, involving obstruction of justice, perjury, and making false statements. He pled not guilty. The former player was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/roger-clemens-trial-verdict-reached/2012/06/18/gJQAQxvzlV_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually acquitted</a> in 2012 due to misconduct by the prosecutor, who showed inadmissible evidence to the jury.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Mark McGwire</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505415" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505415" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mark-McGwire.-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Mark McGwire" width="757" height="506" /> Mark McGwire | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Before Barry Bonds won the single-season home run title, St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris’ old record in 1998 with 70. When he accomplished the feat, it fueled public rumors about his alleged steroid use and spawned questions about how he got so big and strong.

McGwire denied the allegations but did admit to using Androstenedione, a testosterone-boosting pill that was not banned in the MLB at the time. He maintained his position on illegal PEDs for several years and even avoided questions about it during a 2005 congressional hearing on the matter.

It wasn’t until 2010 that the former player <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/baseball/mlb/01/11/mcgwire.steroids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted in a statement</a> that he did in fact use steroids while he chased the home run record.
<h2>4. Manny Ramirez</h2>
Manny Ramirez had a great ride with the Boston Red Sox and was the 2004 World Series MVP. He was also a 12-time All-Star, but his MLB career didn’t end under the best circumstances. During his short tenure with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2009, Ramirez was suspended for 50 games for taking the women’s fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin, or hGC, which is used to restart the normal production of testosterone following a steroid cycle.

Then, in 2011, he faced a 100-game suspension while with the Tampa Bay Rays for violating MLB drug policy for a second time, but instead <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6310125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to retire</a>. Ramirez eventually came back to baseball in 2012 for a very brief run with the Oakland Athletics, but had to serve a reduced 50-game suspension before he even saw the field.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Andy Pettitte</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505434" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-505434" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Andy-Pettitte-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andy Pettitte " width="756" height="533" /> Andy Pettitte | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Former New York Yankees and Houston Astros pitcher Andy Pettitte was another casualty of the Mitchell Report, as he shared the services of trainer McNamee with Clemens. But he claims that he used <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3156305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human growth hormone</a> in 2002 and 2004, a substance that wasn’t banned by professional baseball until 2005.

Pettitte was a significant part of baseball’s PED controversy because he testified that his former Yankees teammate Clemens told him he had also received injections of HGH, a detail that McNamee corroborated. Clemens ducked those allegations by saying Pettitte “misremembered” their conversation. Nevertheless, this aspect played a big factor in the Clemens trial. Pettitte played baseball until officially retiring in 2013.

		<description><![CDATA[The Cubs recently broke their franchise record for their longest game played, but it pales in comparison to the longest baseball games in MLB history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_526820" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-526820 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Red-Sox-Yankees-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 8 Longest Baseball Games Ever Played" width="757" height="493" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Two seasons ago the Chicago Cubs wrapped up the longest game by time in their franchise history, finishing up a 16-inning marathon against the Colorado Rockies that ended in a 4-3 Cubs victory. Those 16 innings, while they surely felt like an eternity for the players and fans in attendance, do not represent the longest game, by innings, in the hallowed halls of Wrigley Field — that honor goes to a 21-inning game between the Cubs and the Dodgers in 1982, a game that was 17 minutes shorter than the six-hour, 27-minute game from 2014.

For the completists, the longest game by time ever recorded in MLB history also happened in Chicago. This was during a 7-6 Chicago White Sox victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, a match that lasted for eight hours and six minutes in 1984. And because you've got it on the tip of your tongue, the Red Sox-Yankees game from last night was "just" six hours and 49 minutes long. Pace of play is working. Measuring the longest baseball games played by innings, though, is considerably more interesting to fans of the sport. Why? Well, you can explain away a time lapse by all sorts of things; extra innings implies a game that’s gone beyond the scope of a normal, expected outcome.

For anyone who might not know, baseball games can only end in a tie under very specific circumstances, so if the game is tied at the end of the ninth inning, which is nominally the last in a game, it continues on into perpetuity until one team finally scores a run over the other. Specifically, the visiting team wins if it scores more runs during the top of an extra inning, while the home team scores a winning run at the bottom.

Call it home-field advantage. There are other technicalities on display, as well, since teams have to forfeit games if they can’t field nine players (and substitution is a carefully monitored art in the MLB, which is why everyone loves a good manager), but generally speaking, extra innings only end when one team outscores the other one. That can take an impressive amount of innings, as you’ll see below, since all of these games make 16 innings look quaint by comparison.

<h2>8. Boston Bees vs. Brooklyn Dodgers, June 27, 1939 – 23 innings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679588" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-679588" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Brooklyn-Dodgers-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 8 Longest Baseball Games Ever Played" width="756" height="611" /> Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

This game, featuring the Boston Bees — you know them today as the Atlanta Braves — and the Brooklyn Dodgers ended in a tie, with each side scoring only two runs apiece in 23 innings. A tie? Yes, a tie. Baseball games can end in a tie for two reasons, the weather or “darkness” (which is sort of a subset of weather, when you think about it). Darkness, as you’ve most likely deduced, is the absence of light, and in 1939, floodlights at every stadium weren’t even a glimmer in the MLB’s eye. Professionals of the day had to endure the same suffering that backyard ballplayers know all too well: when it gets dark, the game has to stop. The game took five hours and 15 minutes to “complete.”
<h2>7. San Francisco Giants vs. New York Mets, May 31, 1964 – 23 innings</h2>
Given the bump over the Dodgers-Bees game because it didn’t end in a tie, the Giants-Mets match was mercifully put to rest when San Francisco scored two runs in the 23rd inning, snapping a scoreless streak of 16 innings, equivalent to one-and-a-half “normal” baseball games. That year, the second in the Mets’ existence, would see the New York club finish with a 53-109 record that doesn’t seem all that different from the Mets of today, although, in actuality, the team hasn’t finished with below 60 wins since 1965 (record: 50-112).

As for the Giants, they would finish 90-72 and miss the postseason for the second straight season since losing the World Series in 1962, a downward streak that would continue for most of the decade. All in all, the game would take seven hours and 23 minutes start to finish.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Detroit Tigers vs. Philadelphia Athletics, June 21, 1945 – 24 innings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679669" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679669" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Detroit-Tigers-1945-Fox-Photos-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 8 Longest Baseball Games Ever Played" width="757" height="587" /> Fox Photos/Getty Images[/caption]

Another game that ended in a tie, the comparatively short four-hour, 48-minute matchup between the Philadelphia Athletics, now in Oakland, and the Detroit Tigers seems like a prime candidate for the “weather” ruling, since it ended in a tie, with each side notching just one run in 24 innings. The last score came to Detroit in the seventh inning, when any fan with any reasonable ability to see into the future would’ve gone home.
<h2>5. New York Mets vs. Houston Astros, April 15, 1968 – 24 innings</h2>
The Mets wound up losing this game, their second appearance on this list of extra-innings baseball games, by letting up one run in the 24th, the only time a run would be scored by either side in this entire match. Imagine being one of the 14,000 fans sitting through 23 scoreless innings at the Astrodome in the midst of just the sixth season in Astros history, when they were a team that had yet to notch a winning record in the short entirety of their existence. That would be absurd, but imagine the emotional payoff when, after six hours and six minutes, the Astros were able to walk away with a win. Those sorts of endorphins are why people follow sports, after all.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Boston Red Sox vs. Philadelphia Athletics, September 1, 1906 – 24 innings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679699" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679699" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ted-Williams-Getty-Images-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 8 Longest Baseball Games Ever Played" width="757" height="588" /> Getty Images/Getty Images[/caption]

The second-longest baseball game in Red Sox history was almost called off earlier, due to darkness, but the game, which took four hours and 45 minutes to complete, ultimately ended in a 4-1 Athletics victory. This game, which is so old <em>Baseball Almanac</em> doesn’t have a proper box score for it, has been preserved by <em>The Boston Globe’s</em> sports section.

Here’s their morning after recap, per <a href="http://www.celebrateboston.com/red-sox/longest-game.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CelebrateBoston.com</em></a>: “For 23 Innings, Boston and the Philadelphia Athletics fought every inch of ground like gladiators, until the players began to show signs of distress and darkness was fast settling over the battlefield. With the record broken and the enthusiastic 18,000 persons worked up to the highest pitch, the plucky Quakers landed a grand victory, not, however, until two men were down and two strikes had been called on the luck Echreckengost, when he singled and sent in the run that told the tale.” If only there was a font that made things read in sepia.
<h2>3. Milwaukee Brewers vs. Chicago White Sox, May 8, 1984 – 25 innings</h2>
We covered this game — the longest clocked game in MLB history — at the start of the post, but it’s worth noting that this game, all eight hours and six minutes of it, must have been absolutely agonizing to sit through. Both teams were tied in the seventh inning and each scored two runs in the ninth, and then proceeded to sit scoreless for 11 more innings, when Milwaukee scored three runs that Chicago, the home team, answered in the 21st. Four innings later, the White Sox were finally able to hammer a run in and nail down the final score: Chicago 7, Milwaukee 6.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets, September 11, 1974 – 25 innings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679729" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679729" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Willy-Mays-Jerry-Siskind-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: The 8 Longest Baseball Games Ever Played" width="757" height="614" /> Jerry Siskind/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Yes, we know that Willy Mays retired a season before this game took place, hanging it up in 1973, but come on, that’s a phenomenal picture, and this game was yet another loss for the Mets anyway, so we’re going to put a bit of a silver lining in this entry. The game, which lasted seven hours and five minutes, would see St. Louis come back in the ninth to tie it all up at three runs apiece as the Mets failed to capture another run in the bottom of the ninth. As the game pushed deep into extra innings, the Mets would remain scoreless for 20 innings, or over two “normal” games, giving up the losing run at the top of the 25th.
<h2>1. Brooklyn Robins vs. Boston Braves, May 1, 1920 – 26 innings</h2>
This was another game that ended in a tie, 1-1, as neither team found itself able to score a single run after the Braves tied it in the sixth inning. This was, of course, due to the ever-present threat of darkness, and the game was called a tie, or a “suspended game” in official Major League Baseball terminology. In what was either an impressive display of great pitching or simply just some terrible offense by both teams, the game was somehow able to cram 26 innings into just three hours and 50 minutes.

		<description><![CDATA[Forbes reports that the average Major League Baseball team is now worth $1.2 billion. Here's a look at the 5 organizations with the highest values.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_722056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722056" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tulowitzki-Jeter.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="548" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

It truly pays to be in Major League Baseball.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">According to Forbes</a>, if you combined the value of each team, the league as a whole would be worth $36 billion. All in all, 15 organizations are now worth at least $1 billion each. This in a 48% increase from 2014, when only five clubs reached that total. That is a major leap for one year.

With the average team value in baseball now at $1.2 billion dollars, the league has never been richer. Still, there are some ball clubs that bring in more dough than others. Here are the five most valuable teams in Major League Baseball today.
<h2>5. Chicago Cubs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_483631" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-483631" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chicago-Cubs-David-Banks-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CHICAGO, IL - SEPTEMBER 15: Anthony Rizzo #44 of the Chicago Cubs celebrates his walk-off home run in the ninth inning against the Cincinnati Reds on September 15, 2014 at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois.

Team value: $1.8 billion

In 2014, the <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc" target="_blank">Chicago Cubs</a> had an operating income of $73.3 million dollars and generated a revenue of $302 million. Then in February, the Ricketts family solid minority interest of the team to six different investors in order to raise $150 million to help renovate Wrigley Field. It was during this deal that the Cubs were given a valuation of $1.8 billion dollars. This organization has come a long way since 2009, when the Ricketts bought the team, Wrigley Field, 25% of Comcast SportsNet Chicago, and some close real estate for $845 million.

<h2>4. San Francisco Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708979" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708979" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456823328-640x415.jpg" alt="Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="492" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Team value: $2 billion

If you’re looking to make money as a sports franchise, then it helps to win championships. Therefore it certainly pays to be the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/sfo/" target="_blank">San Francisco Giants</a>, who in 2014, won their <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/10/29/world-series-game-7-royals-giants-dynasty/18153359/" target="_blank">third World Series title in five years</a>. Most of their now $387 million dollars in revenue can be attributed to sponsorship deals with companies like Adobe, Coca-Cola, Diageo, Lexus, MillerCoors, Oracle, Safeway, StubHub, State Farm, and Yahoo. If you throw in the fact that in the last few years the Giants are also among the top four teams in attendance, it’s easy to see how this organization has reached a value of $2 billion.

Team value: $2.1 billion

Even though the <a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos" target="_blank">Boston Red Sox</a> didn’t have a good season in 2014 (or 2015, if we're being honest) that didn’t stop the organization from garnering $370 million in revenue. With an extremely loyal fan base and a rich history of excellence, this is one of the most storied franchises in Major League Baseball. A down year here and there is not going to do anything to jeopardize their $2.1 billion valuation.

<h2>2. Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>

Team value: $2.4 billion

Three years ago, Guggenheim Baseball Management bought the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers" target="_blank">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and Dodger Stadium from Frank McCourt for <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/30125872/" target="_blank">$2 billion dollars</a>, and now the organization is valued at $2.4 billion. The Dodgers were able to generate $403 million in revenue in 2014, because they had the highest attendance in Major League Baseball, and also took home upwards of $120 million in television money. That’s what tends to happen when you have a 25-year, $8.35 billion deal with Time Warner Cable.

Team value: $3.2 billion

2014 was a record-breaking year for the <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=nyy" target="_blank">New York Yankees</a>, as the organization generated $508 million in revenue. This total can be chalked up to a few different factors. First, the Bronx Bombers made over $100 million in local TV rights payments. And second, the Yankees benefited from a major spike in merchandise sales courtesy of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jeterde01.shtml" target="_blank">Derek Jeter</a>'s last hurrah. All in all, this led to the team in pinstripes to be valued at $3.2 billion.

		<description><![CDATA[Hidden among the many players involved with MLB free agency are 5 talented, experienced players who are severely undervalued.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The concept of a bargain is relative. Buying a new car at the end of its model year and saving 20% will save you a few thousand dollars. In MLB free agency, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-free-agency-players-paid.html/">landing a valuable player</a> for $5 million a year is considered a bargain, relatively speaking. As the regular season concludes, you can call Doug Fister of the Astros a decent steal. For $7 million, the 'Stros got a dependable innings-eater who has won 12 games so far with an ERA a tick over 4.00. Even better bargain? The Blue Jays' J.A. Happ, who cost Toronto about $12 million a year. In what some consider a borderline Cy Young year, Happ leads the Jays staff with 18 wins and an ERA of 3.33.

For those teams already out of the hunt and those teams lacking decent farm systems, it’s time to scroll through the list of players who will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-how-have-the-5-biggest-free-agents-performed-in-2016.html/">become free agents</a> after this season. There is value among the hurlers and position players. An example would be a player who suffered through injuries this season, but is normally solid when healthy. Some free agents need a change of scenery, and some are in the twilight of their careers but may have a productive season or two left. Here are the five best bargains of MLB free agency in 2017.
<h2><strong>1. Jason Castro, catcher, Houston Astros</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_695198" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695198" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tony-Sipp-Houston-Astros-Jason-Castro.jpg" alt="MLB Free Agency: 5 Best Bargains for 2017" width="757" height="501" /> Tony Sipp (R) of the Houston Astros celebrates with Jason Castro after a victory against the Baltimore Orioles | Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

Coming to the end of his Houston contract, Jason Castro earned $5 million this season and will likely be an affordable option for teams looking for a decent <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-6-greatest-catchers-to-ever-play-baseball.html/">catcher</a> with a lot of mileage left in the tank. The former Stanford star -- currently batting .214 with weak OBP number -- is capable of much more, especially since he won’t turn 30 until midway through the 2017 season.

A good handler of pitchers with decent pop, Castro has double-digit home-run totals for the fourth consecutive season. As a fielder, he's thrown-out-stealing numbers are generally below league average, which will prevent him from getting top dollar. As a comparison, Twins catcher Kurt Suzuki (also a free agent) earns $6.5 million. With lots of catchers available on the market, Castro could be a bargain as a starter or backup.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>2. Logan Morrison, first baseman, Tampa Bay Rays</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_695194" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695194" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Logan-Morrison-Tampa-Bay-Rays.jpg" alt="MLB Free Agency: 5 Best Bargains for 2017" width="757" height="529" /> Logan Morrison (L) of the Tampa Bay Rays congratulates Kevin Kiermaier after he scores | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Before you scratch your head on this one (Logan Morrison is out for the season with a wrist injury), we must point out that this first basemen will hit the open market after making only $4.2 million for 2016. Morrison has played for both Florida teams as well as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/uncategorized/mlb-worst-franchises-league-history.html/">Seattle Mariners</a>, and he is seemingly always on the verge of a breakout season.

At age 28, prior to his season-ending injury, Morrison was batting .238 with 14 home runs and 43 RBIs. Known for his versatility -- but a tad error prone in the outfield -- Morrison played only first base this season, but in the past he played right and left field. While it’s likely Morrison will never hit for a high average, he has hit as many as 23 home runs, which could profile him as a strong off-the-bench fill in. Known as a gritty, somewhat vocal guy, Morrison's success will be based on signing with the right team; one with a manager and clubhouse to suit his energetic style.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>3. Brandon Moss, first baseman/outfielder, St. Louis Cardinals</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_695198" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695198" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Brandon-Moss-St.-Louis-Cardinals.jpg" alt="MLB Free Agency: 5 Best Bargains for 2017" width="757" height="501" /> Brandon Moss of the St. Louis Cardinals slides to make a catch against the Chicago Cubs | Dylan Buell/Getty Images[/caption]

Looking at Brandon Moss’s stats and then seeing that he earned only $8 million for the 2016 season, one can imagine the 33-year-old slugger getting double-digit millions for 2017 and beyond. In his 10 years in the majors, Moss averages 25 home runs and 77 RBIs a season. With many injuries to the Cards this season, his 25 dingers this season loom large if St. Louis makes it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-cardinals-path-postseason.html/">as a wild-card team</a>.

A 2014 All-Star when playing with Oakland, Moss has played with six teams in 10 years, which will cause some teams to assume something is wrong with this versatile Georgia native. Compared to some of the high-priced talent on the market, including Jose Bautista, Jay Bruce, Ian Desmond, and Matt Holliday, Moss could be a steal -- and a lot more productive than some of the big names.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>4. Neftali Feliz, Pitcher, Pittsburgh Pirates</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_695197" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695197" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Neftali-Feliz-Pittsburgh-Pirates.jpg" alt="MLB Free Agency: 5 Best Bargains for 2017" width="757" height="530" /> Neftali Feliz of the Pittsburgh Pirates reacts after giving up a solo home run against the Houston Astros | Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

A former All-Star and Rookie of the Year, Neftali Feliz was among the most dominant relief pitchers in 2010, when he racked up 40 saves while striking out more than one batter per inning. He followed that season with a 32-save year before things starting going downhill for the young Dominican.

With the addition of Joe Nathan, the Texas Rangers moved Feliz to the starting rotation. Then, in August, he underwent Tommy John surgery. Feliz came back late in the 2013 season and eventually became the team's bullpen ace in 2014, but his season was cut short by an injury. Still possessing an overpowering fastball, he was cut from the Rangers, and picked up by the Tigers in 2015, but he non-tendered after the season. The Pirates then picked Feliz up for a bargain-basement $3.9 million.

His stats this season look a bit like the Feliz of old, but this time as a set-up man. In 62 games, Feliz is 4-2 with a 3.52 ERA and 61 strikeouts in 53 innings. Top relievers are really difficult to come by, and can be expensive. However, for Feliz to break out of his current mold and earn the big bucks, teams will need to view him as a closer again. His current salary is on par with others of his sort, such as Steve Cishek and Hector Rondon. Perhaps a better comp would be the Giants' Sergio Romo, who makes $8 million a season and is no longer a closer.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>5. Daniel Hudson, Pitcher, Arizona Diamondbacks</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_695195" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695195" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Daniel-Hudson-Arizona-Diamondbacks.jpg" alt="MLB Free Agency: 5 Best Bargains for 2017" width="757" height="530" /> Daniel Hudson of the Arizona Diamondbacks points to an infield pop up | Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]

If for nothing but sheer guts, teams need to take a closer look at Daniel Hudson. In one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/race-worst-team-baseball-interesting.html/">Arizona Diamondbacks'</a> better trades, the team got him from the White Sox in a deal that sent Edwin Jackson to the Southsiders. At the age of 24, Hudson wowed with a 16-12 record and an ERA of 3.49. But after that flash of brilliance, the former Old Dominion star went through two Tommy John surgeries.

For all intents and purposes, Hudson missed the 2013 and 2014 seasons. Loyalty prevailed, and he resigned with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-steps-fixing-arizona-diamondbacks.html/">Diamondbacks</a> after being non-tendered. Hudson pitched well in 2015 as a setup man with a record of 4-3, an ERA of 3.86, and 71 strikeouts in 67 innings. He has lost his way in 2016, and it’s clear he needs a change of scenery. For the right team -- and more importantly the right pitching coach -- Hudson's $2.8 million salary makes him a potential steal.

			<title>11 MLB Pitchers Who Threw 100 MPH or Faster in 2016</title>

		<description><![CDATA[MLB's best are bringing the heat like never before, and the number of pitchers who throw 100 MPH continues to grow. Here are 11 who did it in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_528710310" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-528710310 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-576813068.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="514" /> Aroldis Chapman is just one of the pitchers who throw 100 MPH or faster in today's game | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Does it seem like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-mlb-teams-world-series-titles.html/">Major League Baseball</a> pitchers are throwing harder than ever? While there were no radar guns on the field in 1916, it's safe to say starters were not averaging in the high 90s with their fastballs. Many planned on pitching the entire game, so there was every reason to save bullets for later innings.

One wild century later, no fewer than five starters qualifying for the ERA title averaged over 95.0 miles per hour with their fastball on July 19. Throw in relief pitchers and you can find a total of 37 pitchers throwing at least 95 on their average fastball, with 10 of them averaging 97 or better. If you're going for one inning, you may as well air it out.

To see the increase in the past 10 years alone, just go back to 2007, the first year of PITCHf/x records. That season, <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=pit&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=10&amp;season=2007&amp;month=30&amp;season1=2007&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0&amp;page=1_50">three qualified starters and 22 pitchers overall</a> averaged over 95 miles per hour. Another 15 MLB pitchers hit these elite speeds some nine years later. Here are 11 pitchers who hit triple digits in 2016, including seven who topped 101 miles per hour. We rank pitchers in order of their fastest pitch of the year.

<h2>11. Jose Fernandez, Marlins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702304" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class=" wp-image-702304" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-542024118.jpg" alt="MIAMI, FL - JUNE 21: Jose Fernandez #16 of the Miami Marlins pitches during a game against the Atlanta Braves at Marlins Park on June 21, 2016 in Miami, Florida." width="757" height="480" /> In his final season, Jose Fernandez hit 100 mph for the first time in his career | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

The late Jose Fernandez had posted <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jose-fernandez-case-nl-cy-young.html/" target="_blank">a Cy Young-caliber season</a> when he died in a boating accident in September 2016. It was his first full campaign since recovering from Tommy John surgery, and Fernandez's arm was in excellent condition. He hit 100.2 miles per hour with a four-seam fastball, which was the fastest pitch he ever threw in a big-league game.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Carlos Estevez, Rockies</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743788" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743788" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GettyImages-583556264.jpg" alt="BALTIMORE, MD - JULY 26: Carlos Estevez #54 of the Colorado Rockies works in the ninth inning against the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on July 26, 2016 in Baltimore, Maryland. " width="757" height="467" /> Colorado reliever Carlos Estevez | Matt Hazlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Rockies reliever Carlos Esteves is a mess when it comes to run prevention. The hard-throwing righty posted a 5.24 ERA in 55.0 IP for Colorado in his rookie season. Nonetheless, what the 22-year-old has that can't be taught is velocity. He averaged 98.7 miles per hour with his two-seam fastball and topped out at 100.4 miles per hour with his four-seamer.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Yordano Ventura, Royals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_535552" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-535552" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/456425112-1.jpg" alt="KANSAS CITY, MO - SEPTEMBER 30: Yordano Ventura #30 of the Kansas City Royals reacts after giving up a three-run home run to Brandon Moss #37 of the Oakland Athletics in the sixth inning during the American League Wild Card game at Kauffman Stadium on September 30, 2014 in Kansas City, Missouri. " width="757" height="492" /> The confrontational Yordano Ventura is one of MLB's hardest throwers | Ed Zurga/Getty Images[/caption]

He may rank among <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-hated-mlb-players-in-the-game-today.html/" target="_blank">the most hated men</a> in the game, but Kansas City's Yordano Ventura also ranks among the highest in fastball velocity. Only two starters average a quicker heater than Ventura, who hit 96.3 with his two-seamer for all of 2016. His fastest pitch of the year, a four-seam fastball, clocked in at 100.5 miles per hour.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Carlos Martinez, Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743810" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743810" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GettyImages-597894590.jpg" alt="MILWAUKEE, WI - AUGUST 29: Carlos Martinez #18 of the St. Louis Cardinals pitches in the first inning against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park on August 29, 2016 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin." width="757" height="482" /> Cardinals starter ranks second in average fastball velocity | Dylan Buell/Getty Images[/caption]

Among starting pitchers, only a certain Mets fire-baller can do better than 96.5 miles per hour, which is what Carlos Martinez averaged with his fastball in 2016. The Cardinals starter peaked at 100.9 miles per hour with a four-seamer at one point in the season. His best heater to date came in at <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=11682&amp;position=P" target="_blank">101.3 miles per hour</a> during his rookie season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Dellin Betances, Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_528593044" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-528593044 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-528593044.jpg" width="757" height="451" /> All-Star Dellin Betances hit a new high in velocity in 2016 | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Dellin Betances is an uncommon weapon who attacks hitters not in the ninth inning but rather the sixth or seventh. In 2016, the Yankee reliever hit new highs in velocity with an average of 97.6 for his four-seam fastball and 97.7 with his cutter. Betances, an avid sports fan, can sometimes be seen checking out his velocity on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard after blowing one past a hitter. The right-hander threw his hardest fastball yet -- clocked at 101.2 miles per hour -- in the second half of the season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Ken Giles, Astros</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743842" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743842" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/GettyImages-525288150.jpg" alt="SEATTLE, WA - APRIL 27: Ken Giles #53 of the Houston Astros delivers a pitch during the eighth inning of a game against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field on April 27, 2016 in Seattle, Washington.

Houston reliever Ken Giles may have taken a step back in hits and home runs allowed in 2016, but he didn't lose anything on his velocity. Giles averaged 98.0 miles per hour with his two-seamer and 97.9 with his four-seam fastball on the season. He peaked at 101.0 with a four-seamer.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Noah Syndergaard, Mets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577710114" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577710114" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-577710114.jpg" alt="New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard" width="757" height="469" /> Mets ace Noah Syndergaard is throwing the fastest average fastball of any starter in 2016 | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

In a topsy-turvy season in Flushing, 23-year-old <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/noah-syndergaard/">Noah Syndergaard</a> became the ace of the New York Mets. Thor attacked hitters with the proverbial hammer of the gods: a fastball averaging 97.9 miles per hour, which was best among qualified starters. No one came close to the speed of Syndergaard's fastest sinker in 2016, which was clocked at 101.4. For the record, his fastest four-seamer was just a tick off that pace at 101.3 miles per hour.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Nathan Eovaldi, Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577710002" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577710002 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-577710002.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> After leading MLB in average fastball velocity in 2015, Nathan Eovaldi came out throwing even harder in 2016 | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=9132&amp;position=P">Nathan Eovaldi</a> paced all Major League starters in 2015 with an average fastball velocity of 96.6 miles per hour. For the 2016 season, Eovaldi averaged 97.0 with his four-seamer and matched his career high with a fastball clocked at 101.6 miles per hour. The increase in velocity did not translate into success for Eovaldi, who after a poor campaign underwent Tommy John surgery to repair a torn elbow ligament.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Arquimedes Caminero</h2>
[caption id="attachment_539035" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-539035 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-470489616.jpg" alt="Reliever Arquimedes Caminero prepares to throw" width="757" height="513" /> After bouncing around on MLB teams, Arquimedes Caminero went to play in Japan in 2017 | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

In his brief action as an MLB reliever, Arquimedes Caminero was never able to fully harness his heater. The 29-year-old pitcher maxed out at 102.0 with a four-seam fastball in 2016. That mark was the right-hander's best to date. Unfortunately, Caminero was wild and averaged 5.0 BB per 9. After playing on his third MLB team in four seasons, he went to Japan, where he will don the Yomiuri Giants uniform.<!--nextpage-->

There are those who throw heat, and there are those who top 103 miles per hour on radar guns around the league. The latter category includes just two pitchers, one of whom is Braves reliever <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=cabrer000mau">Mauricio Cabrera</a>, a 22-year-old Dominican native who pitched his first season (38.1 IP) for Atlanta in 2016. Cabrera averaged 100.0 miles per hour with his fastball in that time and maxed out at 103.2 miles per hour -- one of the fastest ever recorded in the PITCHf/x era.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Aroldis Chapman, Yankees</h2>

During the July 18 game at Yankee Stadium, Aroldis Chapman entered the game with a one-run lead and gave the fans their money's worth. The tall lefty threw the fastest pitch of the season, clocking in at 105.0 miles per hour. It was only a shade off his best mark -- a pitch thrown at 105.1 miles per hour, according to PITCHf/x  -- that is also the record for fastest pitch of the era.

		<description><![CDATA[While the top of their staff is set, the New York Yankees rotation for 2017 has several wild cards. Here are our picks for the 5 spots.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_725179" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725179" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-594351598.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="484" /> The projected Yankees rotation may or may not include Michael Pineda (C) in 2017 | Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Originally published November 11, 2016</em>

We'll start with a surprising statistic. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-yankees-better-trade-deadline.html/" target="_blank">New York Yankees</a> had the fifth best ERA (4.16) in the American League in 2016 and the ninth best ERA in Major League Baseball in 2016. When you consider that the team carried Luis Severino (0-8, 8.50) and Michael Pineda (6-12, 4.82), that's quite a feat. However, adding in the stats of ace Masahiro Tanaka and the All-Star bullpen, you see how it's possible.

As far as pitching goes, these two elements -- Tanaka and the pen -- are what the front office will build upon for 2017. While the great Andrew Miller is not under contract next season, New York re-signed closer Aroldis Chapman (five years, $86 million) and has <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=rel&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2016&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=9&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0" target="_blank">bullpen stud Dellin Betances</a> and Tyler Clippard, among others, on board. GM Brian Cashman and his team also have seven starters to choose from internally before looking at the open market.

This organization loves strong bullpens, and it was no surprise when Cashman went all-in on Chapman, even at the elevated sticker price. However, the rotation is trickier to call. Here are five starters we expect in the Yankees rotation in 2017.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Masahiro Tanaka</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682916" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682916 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-589303636.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="509" /> Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka delivers in the first inning of a game | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

When it was Tanaka time in the Bronx, the Yankees had by far their best chance to win. The 28-year-old right-hander led the club in wins (14), ERA, (3.07), WHIP (1.08), and every other meaningful stat. His numbers compared to the rest of the league were equally impressive. He ranked <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/2016-pitching-leaders.shtml" target="_blank">third in the AL</a> in ERA and in WAR (5.5), trailing only Justin Verlander (6.6) and Corey Kluber (6.5).

Despite the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-curious-case-of-masahiro-tanaka.html/" target="_blank">concerns about Tanaka's health</a> going into the 2016 campaign, he started 31 games and threw 199.2 innings in the most productive season of his MLB career. He has the option to opt out of his contract after 2017, so the Yankees may enter their final season with a legitimate No. 1, but that is a concern for another day. Even if another ace turns up in the Bronx this offseason, Tanaka will front the rotation on Opening Day.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. C.C. Sabathia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725206" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725206" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-608793070.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="491" /> Going into his ninth year as a Yankee, C.C. Sabathia has delivered on the value of his contract | Rich Gagnon/Getty Images[/caption]

After several seasons of decline mixed in with knee injuries, C.C. Sabathia turned in his best year since 2012 with 179.2 IP at a 3.91 ERA. The big lefty <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-amazing-comeback-c-c-sabathia.html/" target="_blank">made his revival possible</a> by embracing the cut fastball and other tactics veterans use when their velocity diminishes. This performance cemented his standing as a key part of the Yankees rotation moving forward. As for his presence in the clubhouse and as enforcer (vis-a-vis inside pitches) on the field, Sabathia is essential to the team in '17.

This comeback season gave New York <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=404&amp;position=P#value" target="_blank">the club's best return</a> on the Sabathia contract in years and gives hope going into the final option year. It sounds crazy, but Fangraphs estimates the Yankees would have had to pay $217.9 million on the free agent market to get the equivalent of Sabathia's production since 2009. As it stands, New York paid him $186 million through 2016. So even though his second, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-worst-yankees-contracts-of-the-a-rod-era.html/" target="_blank">post-opt-out contract stunk</a>, let's close the book on that tired debate. He'll be the No. 2 or 3, depending on offseason moves.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Rich Hill or another addition</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725219" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725219" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-615527136.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="476" /> In a weak free agent class, Rich Hill is one of the best options | Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images[/caption]

While the Yankees went into 2016 with high hopes for Pineda and Severino, they enter the upcoming season with little confidence in either. Severino shined in his bullpen role (3-0, 0.39 ERA in 23.1 IP) late in 2016, but even if he does not start 2017 in relief he will have a short leash in the rotation. As for Pineda, management is clearly frustrated with the mercurial pitcher's erratic performances. Meanwhile, Nathan Eovaldi will miss all of 2017 recovering from Tommy John surgery.

The situation opens the door for a starter like Rich Hill, who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-pitchers-available-in-mlb-free-agency.html/" target="_blank">happens to be a free agent</a> and the type of lefty who's a good fit for Yankee Stadium. [<em>Update 12/5/16: Hill signed for three years/$48 million back with Los Angeles.</em>] On top of his sparkling ERA pitching for Oakland and LA last season, he did not allow a home run to any of the 93 left-handed batters he faced. (He allowed just 4 HR to the 346 righties he faced.) His negatives include his age (37), his nonexistent track record (139.1 IP since 2013), and his injury issues.

If the Yankees don't take a stab at Hill, the club's best options exist on the trade market. But all things considered, Hill makes sense because he'll only require three years and none of the valuable prospects New York acquired in 2016.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Michael Pineda</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725246" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725246" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-601178674.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="484" /> Pitcher Michael Pineda of the New York Yankees delivers a pitch against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium on September 9, 2016 | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

We'll run down the cons with Pineda one more time: He's inconsistent, home run-prone, and lacking in mental toughness. However, his positives make him absolutely worthy of a shot as the No. 4 starter in 2017. His fastball tops out at <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=5372&amp;position=P#standard" target="_blank">98.4 miles per hour</a>; his slider is devastating; and is entering his third year of arbitration eligibility. In sum, that makes him dirt-cheap with huge upside.

As the fourth starter, the lack of pressure may suit Pineda well. At the start of 2016, no one was sure if he could stay healthy, but those who believed he would considered him front-of-the-rotation material. He doesn't appear to have the psychological makeup for that role, but his team-leading 32 starts and 207 SO should give him another crack at success in the Bronx. To those who say trade him, we'll point out that management would sell low at this point, making such a deal unlikely.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Bryan Mitchell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725258" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725258" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-603245718.jpg" alt="MLB: A Projected New York Yankees Rotation for 2017" width="757" height="485" /> Pitcher Bryan Mitchell faces the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2016 | Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

The fifth Yankees starter could be Chad Green. It <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/09/luis-severino-has-backers-for-another-look-in-yankees-rotation/" target="_blank">could be Luis Cessa</a>. Of course, it could be Severino if he makes a strong showing in Spring Training. But we believe 25-year-old Bryan Mitchell has a great shot at being the Yankees' final man in the rotation on Opening Day. Mitchell's stellar spring of 2016 ended with a toe injury that knocked him out until September. When he returned, he showed as much poise (probably more) than any other young starter.

His 2016 season began with a scoreless five innings against Toronto with the Yankees trying to claw their way back into the race. After a few shaky outings, Mitchell pitched another great outing against the Blue Jays (6.0 IP, 1 ER) before tossing 7.0 IP scoreless against Boston on September 28. We like his chances because he has four pitches to work with and great velocity to boot. Besides, he's shown the ability to go deep into games, something the team needs desperately in 2017.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_805351" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805351 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-52023365.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Hitters Who Will Go Down in History as Cheaters" width="757" height="480" /> Somehow, cork found its way inside this bat. | Peter Newcomb/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]

<a title="MLB" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/mlb/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> fans unanimously frown upon those who took steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) to gain a competitive edge. Until further notice, players like Sammy Sosa, Alex Rodriguez, and Barry Bonds will not get inside the MLB Hall of Fame unless they buy a ticket.

On the other hand, visitors visiting the hallowed halls of Cooperstown pass the shrines of notorious cheaters of baseball's past. They may not have stuck themselves with syringes, mind you, but there are some epic figures known for their <a title="MLB: 7 Cheating Pitchers Who Make Deflategate Seem Like Child’s Play" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-7-cheating-pitchers-who-make-deflategate-seem-like-childs-play.html/" target="_blank">spitballs and mud pies</a>, their corked bats and sharpened cleats. Then, there are the rest; those who doctored balls and corked bats in semi-obscurity, all the while hoping to simply survive on the big-league level. Living the dream requires sacrifice.

In our series on MLB’s greatest cheaters (excluding those who used PEDs), we turn to the hitters who stuffed their bats in outlandish schemes or otherwise played unfair in ways that warranted suspensions, fines, and a firm place in MLB notoriety. Here’s a look at seven of the great cheaters who plied their trade at the plate over the years. Regretfully, we can only call out those who got caught.
<h2>1. Billy Hatcher</h2>
Fans of baseball in the 1980s remember Billy Hatcher for his play on the Astros and Cincinnati teams of the era. In a contest against the Cubs in '87 -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-7-cheating-pitchers-who-make-deflategate-seem-like-childs-play.html/3/" target="_blank">a horrible year for cheaters</a> -- Hatcher had a curious episode of cork flying out of a bat he broke swinging at a pitch. How did that happen? Hatcher relied on an excuse that will become familiar as we continue with our list of suspects.

“I was out of bats, so I borrowed a pitcher’s bat," <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-02/sports/sp-3418_1_illegal-bat" target="_blank">he told reporters</a> at the time. “I know some of the pitchers use them in batting practice. I don’t know whose bat it was." Umpires did not care whose bat it happened to be and, seeing that Hatcher was the one using it, ejected him from the game. League officials eventually handed Hatcher a 10-game suspension for his troubles.

In what may or not be a coincidence, Hatcher posted a .297 batting average -- the best of his career -- that year for the Astros. We prefer not to speculate.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Albert Belle</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805379" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805379 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-335922.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Hitters Who Will Go Down in History as Cheaters" width="757" height="495" /> Albert Belle looks on. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Depending on how you see it, Albert Belle was either one of the truly colorful figures of 1990s baseball or a legitimate menace to society. Reviewing his remarkably lengthy dossier, <a href="http://www.albertbelle.net/timeline.php" target="_blank">Belle’s antics</a> were not confined to any one type of questionable behavior, including hitting fans with baseballs, the occasional profanity-laced tirade with reporters, and a call to the police in which he threatened to run over Halloween hooligans in his car.

“You better get somebody over here, because if I find one of them, I’ll kill them," Belle <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-02/sports/sp-63899_1_albert-belle" target="_blank">reportedly told a 911 operator</a> one Halloween after his house was egged. (Trick or treat!) Then, there was the time Belle didn’t like the fact that Fernando Vina was standing between him and second base.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VV3fNK31HD4"></iframe>

Well, maybe the only way to see it is this: Belle was an absolute terror both on and off the field, and at one point the slugger was ordered to undergo counseling by the American League President. But this tale merely involves cheating. To that end, we flash back to 1994, the year before Belle hit a career-high 50 home runs.

During the first inning of a game against the White Sox, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-030603bellestory1-story.html" target="_blank">umpires confiscated his bat</a> following allegations of corking from the Chicago bench. The umps stored the suspicious lumber in a locker and planned to send it to the league office for examination after the game. The bat never made it. According to wild contemporary reports, one of Belle’s Indians teammates crawled 30 feet through stadium ductwork connecting the clubhouse to the umpire’s room and replaced the bat with a Paul Sorrento model.

“It was definitely a break-in," umpire Dave Phillips told the Chicago Tribune at the time, while new commish Bud Selig vowed the league would get to the bottom of the matter. Indians pitcher Jason Grimsley later admitted to the foul play, and Cleveland returned the bat in question to the umpires in hopes of avoiding more dire consequences from the league. Belle <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-030603bellestory2-story.html" target="_blank">received a 10-game suspension</a> for the bat, which turned out to most certainly be corked. It was neither the first nor the last time Belle would be disciplined by MLB officials.
<h2>3. Amos Otis</h2>
Amos Otis did for batters what Preacher Roe and Gaylord Perry did for pitchers, in that he was refreshingly open about his foul play with bats after retiring in 1984. The occasion came when Otis was inducted into the Mobile (Ala.) Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. He <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-28/sports/sp-1030_1_corked-bat" target="_blank">told the Mobile Press</a> the induction marked the third such hall he joined to date in his career. What were the other two?

“I’m in the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame, and I’m also in the hall of shame. That’s when you cheat in the big leagues," Otis said at the time. “I did it my whole career in the American League." Rarely was a hitter so forthcoming, and Otis said he got tremendous help from the corked bat, which a friend used to put together for him. He added that corking was common at the time, though only a few players got caught.

Otis never found himself in the commissioner’s crosshairs for his experiments with corked bats. For that, we believe he deserves a cheater’s good sportsmanship award (if such a thing exists) for coming clean on his own accord.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Sammy Sosa</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805479" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805479 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-2041797.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Hitters Who Will Go Down in History as Cheaters" width="757" height="520" /> Sammy Sosa frustrated at the plate. | John Zich/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Baseball was good to Sammy Sosa, and the Cubs slugger tried everything he could to deliver results that would please the gods. Since we are leaving PEDs out of this discussion, we focus on Sammy’s bat corking incident in 2003, the year his life took a dark turn. By year’s end, he was on a list that included <a title="MLB: 5 Takeaways From David Ortiz’s Rant on Steroids" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-5-takeaways-from-david-ortizs-rant-on-steroids.html/" target="_blank">David Ortiz</a> and many other players whose names trickled out from the first round of PED “survey" testing.

Before that went down, Sosa was in the middle of an embarrassing incident at Wrigley Field on June 4 against Tampa Bay. He had not gone deep in over a month that included stints on the disabled list and general slumping after connecting for his 500th home run earlier in the season. That day, he shattered a bat that revealed a healthy serving of cork in its hollowed-out center. Umpires confiscated the bat and ejected Sosa, who ended up serving a seven-game suspension.

He did not take the Otis good-guy approach. Instead, Sosa said he "grabbed the wrong bat," <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/33" target="_blank">according to ESPN</a>, and that the one in question was a highlight-reel bat reserved for wowing the Wrigley faithful before the game. "I use that bat for batting practice," he said. “It’s something that I take the blame for. It’s a mistake. I feel sorry."
<h2>5. Graig Nettles</h2>
In one of the more humorous episodes of bat-stuffing over the years, Yankees third baseman Graig Nettles got into a pickle during a 1974 game versus Detroit. Nettles broke a bat hitting a single and six super balls came flying out of the barrel, which the Tigers catcher collected from the field. Though he had already belted a home run in that game, only Nettles’s single was stricken from the the record books.

As with many instances of cheaters on this list, Nettles claimed that the bat came to him under strange circumstances -- specifically, in Chicago, where it was the gift of a local Yankees fan as the team made its Midwest swing that summer. His excuse, recounted in <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/cheaters/ballplayers.html" target="_blank">a vintage ESPN article</a>, is precious in its implausibility.

"Some Yankees fan in Chicago gave it to me and said it would bring me good luck," Nettles told reporters. "There’s no brand name on it or anything. Maybe the guy made it himself. It had been in the bat rack, and I picked it up by mistake, because it looked like the bat I had been using the last few days."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Wilton Guerrero</h2>
[caption id="attachment_805508" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805508 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-50904165.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Hitters Who Will Go Down in History as Cheaters" width="757" height="486" /> Wilton Guerrero at the plate. | Dave Kaup/Getty Images[/caption]

Wilton Guerrero said he had never used a corked bat before he got caught one fateful day in 1997, and by the looks of his amateurish actions, that story passes the scrutiny test. According to reports, Guerrero <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-02/sports/sp-64911_1_corked-bat" target="_blank">broke the corked special</a> on an infield grounder. Instead of running down the first base line -- where runners go in baseball -- Guerrero scrambled after the pieces of bat that went flying in another direction.

That curious behavior made umpires suspicious, and sure enough they found bits of cork bulging from the barrel. To his credit, Guerrero did not rely on fantastical tales and instead offered a straight story about what happened. “I’ve had it for about two or three months," he said. “I had some doubts about using it before, but I decided to use it today." As some of these stories suggest, the advantage of using a corked bat was negligible for Major League hitters.
<h2>7. Chris Sabo</h2>
Cincinnati’s Chris Sabo had his own run-in with MLB officials in 1996, the last season of his nine-year pro career. Facing Mike Hampton of the Astros, Sabo broke at least one bat before a large chunk of the barrel went flying onto the field at Riverfront Stadium. Umpires saw the foreign substance inside and sent Sabo packing.

The <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-30/sports/sp-29600_1_corked-bat" target="_blank">Associated Press account</a> is familiar enough. Umpire Tom Hallion, who was working home plate for the game, went down the third-base line and got the suspicious lumber. When he showed it to crew chief Ed Montague, there was only one thing to do. “It’s a no-brainer," Montague said after the game. “The bat broke and cork flew out." Sabo’s day was done, and his career followed suit at the end of the season.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_493175300" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-493175300 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-493175300.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="342" /> Three wins since 2010 put the Giants on the leaderboard for most World Series titles.| Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

What would it mean if the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/chicago-cubs/" target="_blank">Chicago Cubs</a> won the World Series in 2016? Probably everything to a franchise that hasn't claimed a title since 1908. Historically, it would mean little: the Cubs only have two championships in 16 tries since the club was formed in 1876. That's a .125 winning percentage in the Fall Classic, worst in MLB history.

By comparison, the Marlins franchise (est. 1993) has two titles in two chances, as does Canada's pride, the Toronto Blue Jays (est. 1977). Over on the South Side, the White Sox have three in six chances.

But this one's not for the teams trying to claw back to relevance or for the eight clubs that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-8-teams-that-have-never-won-the-world-series.html/" target="_blank">never won a World Series</a> in the first place; it's for the all-time winningest clubs in baseball history. Everyone knows who sits at the top of a very lopsided list, but there has been significant movement since the start of 2000. Here are the five teams with the most World Series titles.
<h2>5. San Francisco Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_458073262" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-458073262 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-458073262.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="495" /> Madison Bumgarner celebrates with teammates after closing out the 2014 World Series. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Most fans know about the Giants' even-year dominance with titles in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Prior to that run, the franchise had not <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SFG/" target="_blank">won a World Series since 1954</a>, when the club was still in New York and Leo Durocher's squad swept the 111-win Indians in four games. Overall, the Giants have eight World Series titles, with the other four coming in 1933 and earlier.

Though Bruce Bochy's three series wins this decade are impressive, the legendary John McGraw won three of his own in eight tries, starting in 1905. Since its first Series appearance in 1888, the Giants are 8-15 in the Fall Classic, good for a .347 winning percentage.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Boston Red Sox</h2>
[caption id="attachment_186587847" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-186587847 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-186587847.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="527" /> Boston's three titles in the 21st century followed eight decades of disappointment. | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

You should have seen the Boston Red Sox of 1918. That team had Wally Schang, Harry Hooper, and Bullet Joe Bush. It also had Babe Ruth, who won two games as a pitcher and led the club with 2 RBI in the Series as a hitter. The Cubs were no match for Boston that year, and the franchise had its fifth title in five tries. Soon after, Ruth was making his way to the Yankees where he'd find far more fame as a slugger.

It took another 86 years, but the Red Sox eventually got back to those winning ways. The 2004 triumph ended what some say was a curse hanging over the club; others say it choked away its opportunities, offering <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/buckner-lets-ground-ball-roll-through-his-legs" target="_blank">Bill Buckner's 1986 gaffe</a> as evidence. In any event, Boston has emerged as one of the game's top franchises in the 21st century. With wins in 2007 and 2013, the club has eight titles -- equal to the Giants, but at a better winning percentage (.615).<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Oakland Athletics</h2>
[caption id="attachment_502803986" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-502803986 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-502803986.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="490" /> Dave Henderson throws the ball to the infield at the Oakland Coliseum in 1989. | Otto Gruel Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

Before the Splash Brothers, there were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al7tG5fLThk" target="_blank">the Bash Brothers</a>  -- Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco -- leading Oakland to a title with Dave Henderson and Rickey Henderson aboard in 1989.  That club took out the Giants in four games for the franchise's ninth World Series, putting it alone in third place. Prior to that championship, the Athletics won three straight (1972-1974) in the Catfish Hunter-Reggie Jackson era.

To find the other titles in A's history, you have to go back to the team's origin in Philadelphia, where Connie Mack won five World Series in nine appearances as the club's manager. Mack had a remarkable 49-year run in the City of Brotherly Love, and the franchise wouldn't have half its trophies without him. Overall, the Athletics are 9-6 in the World Series (.600).<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. St. Louis Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_130766446" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-130766446 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-130766446.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="530" /> St. Louis's 2011 win was one of the most thrilling World Series in memory. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The St. Louis Cardinals never go too long without giving their fans something to cheer for, and the club's 11 World Series titles are all the proof you need. Today's fans likely have <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?page=wojciechowski-111027" target="_blank">the riveting 2011 Fall Classic</a> in mind when thinking about this team, but the franchise's first title dates back to 1886, when it nickname was the Browns. (A 3-3-1 tie in 1885 against the Chicago White Stockings can't be counted here.)

Fans of opposing teams may grind their teeth when thinking of The Cardinal Way, but you can't argue these results. Only one club has racked up more titles than the Redbirds, and its 23 NL pennants are tied for second with San Francisco. St. Louis has the edge on the Giants in both winning percentage and championships. The franchise has an 11-12 record (.478) in World Series play.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. New York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_528710310" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-528710310 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-493765.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="523" /> The Yankees captured their 25th title with a win over Atlanta in 1999. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to the MLB postseason, you have the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-best-mlb-teams-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">New York Yankees</a> and everyone else. The club has won an astonishing 27 World Series titles and 40 AL pennants since its founding in 1903. In every era, there was an impossibly legendary player: Ruth in the '20s; Gehrig in the '30s; DiMaggio in the '40s; and Mantle (plus Berra) in the '50s and early '60s. Each won more titles individually than most MLB teams combined.

By the 1990s, a group of wisely drafted and immensely talented players ushered in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-what-made-the-yankees-so-great-in-the-late-90s.html/" target="_blank">a new Yankees dynasty</a>, and that team won four titles in five years between 1996 and 2000. Recent Yankees teams have not had the same epic force, but the 2009 title proved the club is never too far from a championship. It's hard to imagine any team ever catching up the Bronx Bombers' title count. Since its first World Series appearance in 1921, New York is 27-13 against the National League (.675).

		<description><![CDATA[The Chicago Cubs haven't won a World Series in 108 years, but there are 7 reasons why we believe they will finally win the Commissioner's Trophy in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Cubs-Sign-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CHICAGO, IL - OCTOBER 22: Chicago Cubs fans hold a sign after the Chicago Cubs defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-0 in game six of the National League Championship Series to advance to the World Series against the Cleveland Indians at Wrigley Field on October 22, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois.

You could have made a case for any number of teams in Major League Baseball to be serious contenders to win the World Series in October this season. For most of the year, you could have not-so-quietly whispered that you thought this season might finally be the one that saw the end to the most well known (and still active) curse in professional sports history.

That's right, the Chicago Cubs, who have famously not won baseball's most prestigious championship since 1908 -- even played in one since 1945 -- had <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-the-2016-world-series.html/">as strong a case as anybody</a>, even if you were too superstitious to say it. In fact, you didn't have to say anything if you didn't want to --  among the many great reasons to like the Cubbies, they were at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-national-league-power-rankings.html/">top of our National League power rankings</a>. and now, here they are, with just the Cleveland Indians standing in their way. Here are seven more reasons why the Cubs will win the World Series this year.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Intelligent manager and front office</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Theo-Epstein-Chicago-Cubs.jpg" alt="Theo Epstein (R), President of Operations for the Chicago Cubs, talks with head football coach Jim Harbaugh of the University of Michigan before the game between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on July 27, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. | Jon Durr/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Theo Epstein talks with Jim Harbaugh of the University of Michigan before the game between the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs | Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cubs were long known as an extremely regressive organization with rumors once circulating that their scouts had no access to data and did not know how to use Microsoft Excel or an email account. Those stories are as recent as five years ago, but now the Cubs are a leader in their industry concerning data, technology, and finding market inefficiencies. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-5-best-managers-in-baseball.html/">Manager Joe Maddon</a> and team president Theo Epstein are well-respected, intelligent experts, and they’ll team up to bring the Cubs to the promised-land.

<h2>2. World Series experience</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-531635150.jpg" alt="CHICAGO, IL - MAY 15: Starting pitcher Jon Lester #34 of the Chicago Cubs looks for the signals against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Wrigley Field on May 15, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)" width="757" height="488" /> Jon Lester looks for the signals against the Pittsburgh Pirates | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

While the team is youthful, the Cubs have a surprising amount of World Series experience in their dugout. Jon Lester, John Lackey, and David Ross won the World Series with the Boston Red Sox; Lester won it with them twice. Ben Zobrist won the World Series last season with the Kansas City Royals. Maddon took the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays to the World Series, and Jason Hammel played a role on that team as well. Experience is another notch in the Cubs' belt concerning a potential World Series win this year.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Great starting pitching</h2>
[caption id="attachment_581473" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-581473" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jake-Arrieta-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Reasons the Chicago Cubs Win World Series" width="757" height="504" /> Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs is pumped up | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cubs have great, deep starting pitching. Jake Arrieta has struggled a bit recently, but he still has a 2.42 ERA in 583 innings since the start of the 2014 season and pitched well against the San Francisco Giants in the NLDS. Lester has been fantastic in a Cubs uniform as well, with a 2.89 ERA in 407 2/3 innings since joining the Cubs last year. Kyle Hendricks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-most-underrated-starting-pitchers-in-baseball.html/">is the unsung hero of the pitching staff</a>, leading all of Major League Baseball in ERA this season at 2.13 and tossing 7 1/3 shutout innings in the clinching Game 6 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. That’s a tough top-three for a playoff series, and don’t forget John Lackey and all of his playoff experience, too.

<h2>4. The kids can play</h2>
[caption id="attachment_581473" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-581473" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-540263646.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Reasons the Chicago Cubs Win World Series" width="757" height="504" /> Albert Almora Jr. (C) of the Chicago Cubs celebrates with Dexter Fowler (L) and Jason Heyward after a 4-3 victory against the Washington Nationals on June 14, 2016 | Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

Outside of the normal names you recall with the Cubs, they have several additional young players who show abilities to play well at the major league level. Willson Contreras, a catcher who they’ve also played in the outfield a bit, had a .845 OPS and 12 home runs in 76 games played since coming up with the Cubs in June. He also hit a big home run off Clayton Kershaw in Game 6 of the NLCS.

Albert Almora Jr., who made the postseason roster after spending most of the season at Triple-A, is just 22 years old and provided 0.7 WAR in only 47 games. Javier Baez, who played all over the field in a super-utility role, had 3.4 WAR with 14 home runs, including two game-winning homers — and he’s only 23 years old. Did we mention that he was the NLCS co-MVP with Lester? Baez is just one of the kids who is playing a major role.

<h2>5. Shutdown relief</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Aroldis-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CHICAGO, IL - OCTOBER 22: Aroldis Chapman #54 of the Chicago Cubs reacts after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-0 in game six of the National League Championship Series to advance to the World Series against the Cleveland Indians at Wrigley Field on October 22, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)" width="757" height="504" /> Aroldis Chapman reacts after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-0 in game six of the National League Championship Series| Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

The Chicago Cubs had some struggles in middle relief earlier this year, but they’ve seemingly fixed that with a flurry of moves. They’ve added left-handers Mike Montgomery and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-desperate-cubs-great-reliever.html/">Aroldis Chapman</a>, and those guys have played a major role in the ‘pen. The Cubs are nearly unbeatable when they enter the eighth inning or later with a lead, which means the Indians will pretty much have to get at their starting pitchers in the World Series or risk having the game end early.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Top of the lineup</h2>
[caption id="attachment_581675" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-581675" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-493293704.jpg" alt="MLB: 7 Reasons the Chicago Cubs Win World Series" width="757" height="484" /> Dexter Fowler runs the bases during Game 2 of the 2015 MLB National League Championship Series | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Few teams can match the greatness that the Chicago Cubs have at the top of their lineup this season. With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-biggest-bargain-free-agent-signings.html/">Dexter Fowler</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-best-players-under-age-25.html/">Kris Bryant</a>, Anthony Rizzo, and Zobrist, the Cubs have four of the top 40 hitters in baseball, according to WAR. They also combined for 102 home this year, which is excellent. Bryant is likely to be named the National League MVP, after hitting 39 homers with 121 runs scored and 102 RBI, while putting together 7.7 WAR. With other quality hitters hiding in the lineup as well, the Indians will have a rough time dealing with that top-four of the Cubs.

<h2>7. World Series odds</h2>

The biggest reason to believe that the Cubs are going to win the World Series this season? The odds say they have the best chance. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/coolstandings.aspx" target="_blank">According to Fangraphs</a>,  the Cubs are favored at a 64.5% chance over the Indians at 35.5% (they’ve been the frontrunners since July, with a  18.5% chance — still better than all other teams in Major League Baseball at the time). The odds don’t always tell you what’s going to happen, and even 64.5% is no sure thing, but with the best record in baseball, their pitching, their defense, their management, and their hitting, it’s hard to bet against the Cubs. the Chicago Cubs have a 47.7% chance of winning it all (back in July, they were still in front, with a  18.5% chance -- still better than all other teams in Major League Baseball at the time). The odds don’t always tell you what’s going to happen, and just under 50% is no sure thing (but neither was a one-in-five shot), but with the next closest team coming in at just 34.7%, it’s hard to bet against the Cubs.

		<description><![CDATA[The Chicago Cubs are the best team in baseball, so it's time to start looking ahead. Who do they want to play in the NLDS?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/chicago-cubs/">Chicago Cubs</a> are beginning to run away with the best record in baseball, sitting at 97-55 coming into play on Friday (as of publication). That places them at 8 games ahead of the next closest team, the Washington Nationals, which almost completely assures that they’ll have the home-field advantage in the NLDS. All contenders <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-concern-national-league-contender.html/">come with their share of concerns</a>, but for the Cubs the biggest question may have to do with who they end up drawing in the first round of the postseason. So who do the Chicago Cubs want to face in the playoffs? Here is the case for each of their four likely opponents.
<h2>Miami Marlins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657984" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657984" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-538280616.jpg" alt="MLB: Who Do the Chicago Cubs Want in the Playoffs?" width="757" height="488" /> Jose Fernandez of the Miami Marlins pitches during a game against the New York Mets | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

The Marlins are still close -- albeit on the outside -- in the wild-card chase. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-marlins-survive-losing-stanton.html/">Losing Giancarlo Stanton</a> for the season won’t help their chances, but at this point anything is possible. Should they make it to the wild-card game and then into the NLDS, the Chicago Cubs would match up against a young, inexperienced team with a thin pitching staff beyond ace Jose Fernandez, who would presumably pitch, leaving him only really available for Game 3 of the series.

Miami is nothing special in the run-scoring department, either, ranking No. 11 in the National League despite having several hitters in the regular lineup with individual good seasons. Seven of their eight starters this season -- counting those on the disabled list -- have an OPS over .750. Considering all the facts, the Marlins might be one of the more ideal matchups for the Chicago Cubs in the postseason.

<h2>Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_678182" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-678182" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-546620198.jpg" alt="MLB: Who Do the Chicago Cubs Want in the Playoffs?" width="757" height="475" /> Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers (C) looks on prior to the 87th annual MLB All-Star Game on July 12, 2016 | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

The Dodgers are currently <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-dark-horse-world-series-contenders.html/">leading the NL West</a>, but there are two scenarios in which the Chicago Cubs could play them in the NLDS. First, the Dodgers could fall out of the division lead and end up a wild card, and second, the Cubs could hit a skid that lands them just the second-best record in the National League. If this scenario shakes out, it’s probably one of the better options for the Cubs as well -- at least based on what we know now.

The Dodgers have had a slew of pitching injuries, with Clayton Kershaw <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dodgers-surged-without-clayton-kershaw.html/">not having pitched</a> since late June and no official timetable for when he may return. Rich Hill just came off the disabled list -- finally -- and they’re still waiting on Brett Anderson, Scott Kazmir, and Brandon McCarthy. There’s a decent chance that should the Dodgers end up playing the Cubs, they won’t have their full complement of pitchers available.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>St. Louis Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680335" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680335" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Aledmys-Diaz-St.-Louis-Cardinals.jpg" alt="MLB: Who Do the Chicago Cubs Want in the Playoffs?" width="757" height="505" /> Aledmys Diaz of the St. Louis Cardinals celebrates after hitting a walk-off single against San Diego Padres | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

Facing the St. Louis Cardinals would be a rematch of last year’s NLDS, which the Cubs won 3-1. The Cardinals have experienced a rough time with the pitching this year, getting a good year from starter Carlos Martinez but not much from anybody else. They’ve had injuries to their position players and poor years from Kolten Wong and Randal Grichuk, but somehow Brandon Moss and Jedd Gyorko have combined for 47 home runs in less than 700 plate appearances.

Facing the Cardinals doesn’t seem like an ideal matchup. Outside of the team’s familiarity with each other (the Cardinals at leading the season series, 7-6), there’s the fact that the Cards have recently called up pitching prospects Luke Weaver and Alex Reyes. A rotation featuring those two, plus Martinez and veteran Adam Wainwright, could be the kind of "lightning in the bottle" that a clearly inferior team like the Cardinals could use to beat the Chicago Cubs in the postseason. As fun as seeing these rivals play in the postseason again might be, it’s not ideal.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>San Francisco Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_606044" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-606044" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SF-Giants-World-Series.jpg" alt="MLB: Who Do the Chicago Cubs Want in the Playoffs?" width="757" height="505" /> Buster Posey and Madison Bumgarner of the San Francisco Giants celebrate after defeating the Kansas City Royals during the 2014 World Series -- a more successful time for the Giants | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Another less-than-ideal matchup for the Chicago Cubs would be the San Francisco Giants. As of right now, the Giants would play against the Cardinals in the wild-card game with the winner heading to Chicago. That likely means that Madison Bumgarner would have pitched already and wouldn’t be able to go again until Game 3. But they also have Johnny Cueto on their pitching staff, meaning that the Giants could throw Cueto and Bumgarner in three of the five potential games in a series against the Cubs.

And that’s not what you want. Toss in the fact that former Cubs pitcher Jeff Samardzija -- likely out for some sort of revenge for being traded two seasons ago -- would be another pitcher they’d face, and this series has all kinds of potential for disaster. It’s also worth pointing out that it’s an even year, meaning the Giants are on schedule to win another World Series trophy this season; they’ve won it every even year going back to 2010. Of all the potential teams that the Cubs could face in the NLDS this season, the Giants are the worst possible matchup.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/" target="_blank">MLB</a> season is long and arduous. It's a 162-game marathon filled with doubleheaders, rain delays, a questionably slower pace, and more low-scoring affairs than most sports fans can handle. It's fair to say that not everyone can handle the commitment it takes to be a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/green-bay-packers-best-fans-nfl.html/"><em>true</em> fan</a> of the sport.

Of course, when the postseason rolls around and you just so happen to have a horse in the race, then that pretty much changes everything. Now that we're heading into the home stretch of the year, we can almost see the finish line that is playoff baseball.

With 10 games or so left to play in the regular season, a handful of teams have emerged as legitimate title contenders -- and the oddsmakers have taken notice. As we inch closer to the most exciting part of a Major League Baseball season, here's a look at who Vegas is picking to win the 2016 World Series.
<h2>7. Toronto Blue Jays</h2>
[caption id="attachment_571840" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-571840" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jose-Bautista_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x421.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="498" /> Joey Bats has the Blue Jays feeling excited | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +1400

Although the Toronto Blue Jays are just 5-5 in their last 10 games, they still have a reason to be excited as we get closer to the month of October. With 10 games left on their schedule, the Blue Jays, led by MVP candidate Josh Donaldson (.284 batting average, 35 home runs, and 94 RBIs and and Cy Young Award hopeful J.A. Happ (20-4, 3.28 ERA), have a 83-69 record and sit atop the AL <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/standings/_/view/wild-card/group/league">Wild Card standings</a>. If this group can finish the season out strong, anything is possible come playoff time.

<h2>6. Cleveland Indians</h2>
[caption id="attachment_670121" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-670121" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-545729802-640x408.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, OH - JULY 9: Jose Ramirez #11 of the Cleveland Indians celebrates as he runs out a RBI single to tie the game during the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Progressive Field on July 9, 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +900

The Cleveland Indians are only 6-4 in their last 10 games, but that doesn't change the fact that they enter the home stretch of the regular season season as one of the best teams in all of baseball. With 10 games remaining on their schedule, the Tribe are 89-63, hold a plus-108 run differential, have the sixth-lowest <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2016-standard-pitching.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7" target="_blank">team ERA in the majors</a> at 3.79, and are seven games up in the Central Division. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but it's not out of the question that the city of Cleveland could be looking at another pro sports title in the near future. How nuts would that be?

<h2>5. Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657957" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657957" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-541906316-640x413.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 20: Clayton Kershaw #22 of the Los Angeles Dodgers reacts to his wild pitch during the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals at Dodger Stadium on June 20, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +800

The Los Angeles Dodgers may have had their ups and downs throughout the 2016 season, but they're making moves at just the right time. With nine games left on their schedule, the Dodgers are 87-66, hold the fourth-lowest team ERA in the bigs at 3.66, and have a six-game lead atop the NL West division. Los Angeles certainly isn't the favorite to win the World Series this year, but it'd be foolish to overlook such an experienced group. We'll known soon enough if the Dodgers have enough firepower to make things interesting in the postseason.

<h2>2. (tie) Boston Red Sox</h2>
[caption id="attachment_640533" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-640533" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-530879412-640x401.jpg" alt="BOSTON, MA - MAY 11: Jackie Bradley Jr. #25 of the Boston Red Sox returns to the dugout after hitting a two-run home run in the eighth inning during the game against the Oakland Athletics at Fenway Park on May 11, 2016 in Boston, Massachusetts.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +550

The Boston Red Sox are the hottest team in Major League Baseball. This group is 8-2 in its last 10 games, including an eight-game winning streak, have outscored its opponents by 188 runs on the year, and with nine games remaining on the schedule, hold the best record in the AL East at 89-64. Boston has chosen the perfect time to start playing its best ball of the year. and that should pay dividends in the postseason. The Red Sox are a team to be feared.

<h2>2. (tie) Texas Rangers</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adrian-Beltre-Ian-Desmond-Texas-Rangers.jpg" alt="Adrian Beltre #29 of the Texas Rangers is congratulated by Ian Desmond #20. | Rich Schultz/Getty Images" width="757" height="578" /> Adrian Beltre #29 of the Texas Rangers is congratulated by Ian Desmond #20 | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +550

Even with 5-5 mark in their last 10 games, the Texas Rangers remain a force to be reckoned with in the American League. As we head into the final stretch of the year, the Rangers hold a 90-63 record overall, are 50-25 at home, sit nine games up in the AL West, and have a <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2016-standard-batting.shtml#teams_standard_batting::17" target="_blank">team batting average</a> of .264 (tied for the third best in the bigs). Given the level of talent and experience on this roster, if the Rangers are able to stay the course heading into the postseason, the rest of Major League Baseball better watch out.

<h2>2. (tie) Washington Nationals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_548592" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-548592 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bryce-Harper-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-e1437138145225.jpg" alt="Bryce-Harper-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-e1437138145225.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Bryce Harper has the Nationals fans thinking World Series | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +550

Despite going <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings" target="_blank">5-5 in their last 10 contests</a>, the Nationals, with a 89-63 record, hold a more-than-comfortable 8.5-game lead atop the NL East standings. On top of that, the Nats have the second best ERA (3.43) in baseball, have outscored their opponents by 152 runs on the year, and still have, despite an underwhelming season (by his standards), easily one of the best and most exciting players in Major League Baseball in Bryce Harper, a one-man wrecking ball who can turn the tides with a single swing of the bat. The Nationals have a history of faltering in the postseason. Maybe 2016 is the year they finally get over the hump. Hey, crazier things have happened.

<h2>1. Chicago Cubs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_556591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-556591 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cubs-Jon-Durr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jon Durr/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> These Chicago Cubs are good | Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +240

After a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-cubs-hot-start-has-some-historical-comparisons.html/" target="_blank">historic start to the 2016 season</a>, the Chicago Cubs, despite coming back down to Earth during the middle of the season, have distinguished themselves as the best team in Major League Baseball.

With 10 games to play, the Cubbies are 97-55, hold a plus-239 run differential, boast the lowest team ERA (3.09) in baseball, have already clinched the NL Central division, and feature a ridiculously explosive lineup led by superstars Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo. And, of course, we can't forget about Chicago's ace -- and reigning NL Cy Young Award winner -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/jake-arrieta/" target="_blank">Jake Arrieta</a>; a man who's somehow managed to raise the bar in 2016

As the team that continues to hold the best record in Major League Baseball, it's no surprise folks in Vegas see the Cubs -- curse and everything -- as the frontrunners to win the 2016 World Series. Now let's see if they have what it takes to make that dream a reality.

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds crazy, but trading Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout to the Phillies makes sense for both teams. Here are 5 reasons why.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_528710622" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-528710622 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-533631114.jpg" alt="5 Reasons the Angels Should Trade Mike Trout to the Phillies" width="800" height="502" /> Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim hits a single against the Baltimore Orioles in May 2016. | Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images[/caption]

“Batting third for the Phillies and playing center field, No. 27, Mike Trout.” Yes, every long-suffering Philadelphia Phillies fan is sitting on the edge of his or her seat hoping that the summer trade deadline brings an early holiday gift in the form of Angels superstar, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-best-players-under-age-25.html/" target="_blank">Mike Trout</a>. Preposterous? Maybe. Out of the question? No.

Currently, the 24-year-old outfielder is batting .316 with 18 home runs and 59 RBIs. You can also add MVP and Rookie of the Year trophies and five straight all-star appearances to Trout's resume. Through his first four full seasons, he was No. 1 in Wins against Replacement (WAR), which clearly means… <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-mike-trout-hardest-player-to-replace.html/" target="_blank">He’s irreplaceable</a>.

However, in the world of baseball, being irreplaceable means a team going nowhere -- aka the Angels -- can ask another team for a bundle to part with the young star. One player bringing in a handful of high-potential minor leaguers can spell the difference between making the playoffs in two years and waiting a decade for a return to prominence. Here are five reasons why the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim should trade Mike Trout to the Phillies.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>1. Awful farm system</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_602429" align="alignnone" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-602429 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LA-Angels-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1454707510721.jpg" alt="5 Reasons the Angels Should Trade Mike Trout to the Phillies" width="757" height="504" /> Los Angeles Angels teammates | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

According to <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/" target="_blank">Baseball America</a>, the Los Angeles Angels have the worst-ranked farm system of the 30 major league ball clubs. On the other hand, the Philadelphia Phillies have the eight-ranked system, using a number of trades and smart drafts to move up 14 rungs on the minor league organizational chart.

The Angels top prospect is catcher Taylor Ward, batting .246 for Inland Empire of the California League. The top pitcher in the Angels farm system is lefty Nate Smith, who plays for the Salt Lake City Bees. In the 2016 Future Game, Smith got battered with four hits in one inning of pitching, giving up two runs. A finesse pitcher with a below-average fastball, Smith is, at best, a back of the rotation starter.

The Phillies are loaded with prospects who could make Angels fans forget Mike Trout -- well, maybe in a few years. While J.P. Crawford may be untouchable, others who could proudly wear an Angels uniform include Nick Williams, Roman Quinn, and Cornelius Randolph. Toss in a current top-flight starter such as Maikel Franco, and you may have a deal.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>2. Trout’s a local boy</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_528710622" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-528710622 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-533133572.jpg" alt="5 Reasons the Angels Should Trade Mike Trout to the Phillies" width="800" height="502" /> Mike Trout returns to the dugout after scoring. | Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images[/caption]

Mike Trout grew up a Phillies fan in Millville, N.J., just 41 miles from Citizens Bank Park. It’s more likely he attended games at (the demolished) Veterans Stadium, which was next door to CBP. Trout’s family still lives in New Jersey.

<a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-05-14/news/49823828_1_mike-trout-jeff-trout-roy-hallenbeck" target="_blank">His first game in Philadelphia</a> since joining the majors was proclaimed Millville Night and 4,000 of his friends and neighbors came to cheer him on. In 2008, when Trout was a senior in high school, he and his friends went to the Phillies World Series parade and walked from the stadium to City Hall.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>3. Mike </strong><strong>Scioscia as Phillies manager</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_465882" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-465882" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mike-Scioscia.jpg" alt="5 Reasons the Angels Should Trade Mike Trout to the Phillies" width="757" height="480" /> Mike Scioscia | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Yes, it’s true that Mike Scioscia has a long-term contract with the Angels, but after a disastrous season in 2016, the Angels might be willing to part ways with the best manager the team has ever had. Heck, they were willing to get rid of Josh Hamilton in the middle of his crazy contract.

Like Trout, Scioscia is a local Philadelphia boy, having grown up in Upper Darby, Pa. Both the Phillies and Angels should be in the market for new skippers in 2017 as the teams are in varying stages of rebuilding. Clearly Pete Mackanin, the current Phillies manager, is not a long-term solution. Scioscia heading to the Phillies would be close to the equivalent of Joe Maddon managing the Cubs.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>4. Trout is a National League player</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_528710622" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-528710622 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Mike-Trout-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Reasons the Angels Should Trade Mike Trout to the Phillies" width="800" height="502" /> Mike Trout at the All-Star Game | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

The National and American Leagues differ in that the Senior Circuit puts a premium on power, speed, and fielding while the American League tends to focus strictly on power. Even though Trout has cut back on his running game (he has no one behind him to protect him), he is the ultimate 30-30 man.

Over his short career, Trout averages 34 home runs and 28 stolen bases per season. Trout will have good company as an NL power-speed guy with the likes of the entire Pirates outfield, any number of Cubs players, Curtis Granderson, and MVP Bryce Harper.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>5. It’s cheaper to live in Philadelphia</strong></h2>

Mike Trout’s current salary of $15.25 million will go much further in the Philadelphia Metro area than in Orange County, Calif. Homes in Philadelphia are about half the price of Anaheim and a dozen eggs are $1 cheaper in the City of Brotherly Love. <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/" target="_blank">Bankrate.com</a> says that Trout could take a 20% pay cut in Philadelphia and maintain his current standard of living.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_584558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584558" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-480707592.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="464" /> James Shields during an MLB game on June 19, 2015 | Christian Petersen Getty Images[/caption]

Trading season is just about a month away, with the MLB non-waiver trade deadline coming on July 31. We’ve already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-relievers-available-trade-deadline.html/" target="_blank">covered the best relievers</a> who might be available for contenders to browse on the open market, but another big need for many teams is starting pitchers.

The San Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox, Texas Rangers, and Baltimore Orioles could all use at least one more starting pitcher to make a push for the playoffs, and there are likely more teams looking for pitching as well.

The Chicago White Sox jumped the market on pitching, acquiring James Shields from the San Diego Padres in exchange for a couple of minor leaguers. The attitude of the Padres shows just how the market may be opening up, <a href="http://www.todaysknuckleball.com/inside-baseball-with-jon-heyman/30-name-players-traded/" target="_blank">according to FanRag Sports’ Jon Heyman</a>:
<blockquote>When the Padres were talking about a James Shields trade with the White Sox, they threw out a few more names. Actually, more than a few. "They’re offering everybody," is the way one club official with a different team that’s recently dealt with the Padres put it. That may be an exaggeration, but the point is, the Padres are open for business. "I’m always going to listen on anybody. You’ve got to,’" Padres general manager A.J. Preller said.</blockquote>
So who can we expect to be dealt? Here are our top five starting pitchers who could be available before the trade deadline.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Andrew Cashner, San Diego Padres</h2>
[caption id="attachment_556801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-556801" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GettyImages-484166912.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="489" /> Andrew Cashner of the San Diego Padres delivers to home plate against the Colorado Rockies on August 15, 2015. | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

Andrew Cashner is almost always the subject of trade speculation due to his electric arm and the perpetual state of awfulness the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-teams-nobody-cares-about-anymore.html/" target="_blank">Padres are stuck in</a>.

The 29-year-old has supplied San Diego with a 3.62 ERA and solid peripheral numbers over the last five years, and he is set to hit free agency at the end of the season. Cashner's problem: He always struggles to stay healthy. Cashner strained his neck in a recent start, necessitating him to being placed on the disabled list.

It doesn’t figure to be a long stay, but when combined with his up-and-down performance this year, his history of injuries, and the fact that he can walk away at the end of the season, you wouldn’t expect the Padres to get a whole lot for Cashner. Even still, they’re in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-padres-pathetic-teams-chairman-says.html/" target="_blank">complete sell-off mode</a>. So if Cashner is able to pitch, expect them to move him.

<h2>4. Jake Odorizzi, Tampa Bay Rays</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584558" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jake-Odorizzi-J.-Meric-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="464" /> Pitcher Jake Odorizzi of the Tampa Bay Rays smiles in the dugout on May 25, 2013. | J. Meric/Getty Images[/caption]

The Rays are in the tightly bunched AL East, so they are still within reasonable distance of the division lead and a potential wild-card berth. The problem is that there are a lot of teams in front of them, and it will difficult for them to make a run.

If they decide in the next month that they’re sellers, the first name on the list <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-most-underrated-starting-pitchers-in-baseball.html/" target="_blank">should be Jake Odorizzi</a>. Tampa Bay reportedly had discussions with a few teams regarding him last offseason -- including a rumor that they wanted to swap him for Javier Baez of the Cubs -- but settled on opening the season with the right-hander.

Odorizzi has performed well this year, posting a 3.79 ERA in 14 starts. He’s just 26 years old, but he’ll enter arbitration next year and the Rays have plenty of starting pitchers -- including a young left-handed stud named Blake Snell, who is sliding into the rotation in the majors right now. With the Rays' small budget and chances of making the playoffs getting slimmer, the team would be wise to deal Odorizzi for a prospect haul right now.

<h2>3. Rich Hill, Oakland A’s</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584558" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Rich-Hill-Oakland-Athletics.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="464" /> Rich Hill of the Oakland Athletics pitches against the New York Yankees on April 21, 2016. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

Rich Hill is an interesting story. A left-hander with a big, breaking curveball and a decent fastball, he set records in the minor leagues for strikeouts. He also struggled with walking people, but he seemed to have everything figured out in 2007, when he was 11-8 with a 3.92 ERA in 195 innings for the Chicago Cubs.

But Hill lost control and only made 18 starts with a 6.87 ERA and 6.8 BB/9 over the next two seasons. From there, he bounced between the minors and the major leagues, only appearing in relief roles with several different teams -- tossing 75 2/3 innings over five seasons. But last year, at 35 years old, the tall lefty put it together again.

Hill made four starts with the Boston Red Sox late in the season, striking out 11.2 batters per nine innings with just 1.6 BB/9 and a 1.55 ERA. He signed with the Oakland A’s in the offseason on a one-year deal and started 11 games with a 2.25 ERA and good peripheral numbers. The A’s may not get a ton in return for a 36-year-old on a one-year deal, but they would be fools not to move him.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Julio Teherán, Atlanta Braves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_556801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-556801" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/454269722.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="489" /> Julio Teherán of the Atlanta Braves pitches in the first inning against the New York Mets on August 27, 2014. | Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

The Braves are in the midst of a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-just-how-bad-is-the-atlanta-braves-offense.html/" target="_blank">massive rebuild</a>, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-tanking-mlb-teams-that-have-become-an-embarrassment.html/" target="_blank">probably won't contend</a> for a playoff spot until 2018 at the earliest. Julio Teherán, their young, 25-year-old ace pitcher who's signed through 2020, could become available for the right price. Of course, that price would probably be expensive. Despite a down year last season, Teherán has a solid 3.31 ERA over the last four years with the Braves.

Atlanta has all the leverage here. With Teherán locked in long term, they could decide to wait until the offseason if they can’t get a package of prospects they like in return. Failing that, they could try again next year at the trade deadline. Suffice to say, there’s a good chance Teherán will remain in Atlanta. But that doesn’t mean he won’t be available.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Sonny Gray, Oakland A’s</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589618" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589618" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-487326054.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Starting Pitchers Who May Be Available for Trade" width="757" height="478" /> Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics pitches against the Houston Astros on September 8, 2015. | Jason O. Watson/Getty Images[/caption]

Another name who may remain in his current location is Sonny Gray. The A’s young ace is in a similar position to Odorizzi; he doesn’t make a ton of money, but he will soon enough. He also pitches in a small market that struggles with their ability to pay their best players, and seems <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-how-the-dodgers-can-move-on-from-iwakuma-and-chapman.html/" target="_blank">destined to go elsewhere</a>.

Gray is also eligible for arbitration next year, which means the A’s will have to either budget a huge raise for him or deal him now. The problem is that Gray is having a down season. He has a 5.54 ERA in 12 starts with a 3.6 BB/9, which is much higher than he posted earlier in his career.

At just 26 years old, there is still a lot to like about this player, and a team that needs pitching -- both in the short- and long-term -- would do well to call up Billy Beane in Oakland. That all said, the A’s could wait until the offseason to deal him, too. So like Teherán, it’s no sure bet that Gray will go anywhere right now.

		<description><![CDATA[The St. Louis Cardinals are out of prospects, out of star power, and already nine games back in the division. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_630109" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-630109" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jeremy-Hazelbaker-St.-Louis-Cardinals.jpg" alt="MLB: The Cardinals Are Already in Big Trouble This Season" width="757" height="547" /> Jeremy Hazelbaker of the St. Louis Cardinals watches his first career home run during the sixth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates | Joe Sargent/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/st-louis-cardinals/" target="_blank">St. Louis Cardinals</a> have had quite the run of success since the turn of the century. Since the year 2000, they’ve made the playoffs in 12 of 16 seasons and have won 90 or more games in all but six seasons. But after seriously dominating for nearly two decades, the Cardinals are starting to hit some hard times. The good news? <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-braves-are-setting-a-new-standard-for-tanking.html/" target="_blank">Things could be worse for Cards fans</a>.

But that doesn’t mean they’re in for a fun season this year -- or beyond. For the longest time, they’ve enjoyed some of their great players, such as Chris Carpenter, Yadier Molina, and Matt Holliday, supplemented by nobodies and guys named Skip, Buck, Bo, and Stubby. They prided themselves on being the masters of finding talent where there was none and using it to put them over the top.

This is why Pujols could leave and go to Los Angeles. It’s why they traded for Jason Heyward, and then allowed him to sign with the rival Chicago Cubs. They’ve replaced Heyward with no-name rookie Jeremy Hazelbaker, and so far this season Hazelbaker has produced with the bat -- although he’s hitting only .191/.255/.447 in his last 51 plate appearances, which lends to the idea that he’s coming back down to earth.

The problem for the Cardinals? They no longer have the star power. Matt Carpenter is having a fine season, with an .842 OPS so far. Even Molina is having a bounce-back year with the bat, hitting .300/.397/.400. But their best pitcher of the last decade, Adam Wainwright, will be 35 this year and has been rocked early in the season, posting a 6.30 ERA in his first seven starts. The replacement for Lackey, Mike Leake, has been awful early in his Cardinals career too (a 6.06 ERA). The pitching, in general, has been shaky at best.
<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_603185" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-603185" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-492503134.jpg" alt="MLB: The Cardinals Are Already in Big Trouble This Season" width="757" height="467" /> The Cardinals try to steal a run during game four of the National League Division Series at Wrigley Field on October 13, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Last year, the Cardinals had a team 2.94 ERA with a 3.47 FIP. Their FIP rose just a bit, to 3.73 as a team this year, but the ERA took a massive jump to 3.92. The worst part? The rotation has remained healthy so far, with even Jaime Garcia staving off any potential shoulder injuries. The pitching depth in St. Louis is extremely lacking, so any injuries in the starting rotation this season will be problematic.

So here the Cardinals are, having received what is likely the best Hazelbaker will ever produce, an amazing start to Almedys Diaz’s career, and production from Garcia, still sitting at 16-16 and nine games behind the Cubs in the division. The Cards aren’t just dealing with a good Cubs team, they’re dealing with a team that's off to a historically great start.

St. Louis is just 5-11 against teams that are over .500 this season, while the Cubs are 9-1 by comparison. The Cubs did all this after losing Kyle Schwarber -- their starting left fielder and all-time playoff home run leader -- in the third game of the season. Chicago got absolutely nothing out of Heyward thus far, as well as any reasonable amount of offense from the catcher position.

However, their young players have stepped up, leading the way on a 24-6 assault on Major League Baseball. And the Cubs' core, made up almost entirely of players in their early to mid-20s, isn’t going anywhere. This team will be a force to be reckoned with for years. So the Cardinals are in trouble.

They don’t have a ton left in the farm system, having graduated Stephen Piscotty, Randal Grichuk, Kolten Wong, and Diaz in recent seasons. They don’t have a deep farm system, although they have a solid top-pitching prospect in Alex Reyes. But he probably won't even make it to the big leagues for another year, and even then we don’t know what he'll look like -- he’s young and has walk issues.

All great things come to an end, and it seems like this applies to the Cardinals' reign of terror in the NL Central division. That’s not to say they won’t find ways to be competitive, but with an aging core, a mediocre roster, and a massive hole in the division behind the Cubs -- seriously they’re closer to the last place Cincinnati Reds than they are to the Cubs -- St. Louis is in for a run of mediocrity for the rest of this season -- and possibly beyond that.

		<description><![CDATA[Here are 3 revelations from Gordon's 80-game ban for PED use.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_521115896" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-521115896 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-521115896.jpg" alt="MLB: The Surprising Twists of Dee Gordon's PED Suspension" width="800" height="502" /> Dee Gordon runs the bases at Nationals Park | Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

Not even a calendar week in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2016-mlb-season/" target="_blank">2016 MLB season</a> passed between performance-enhancing drug suspensions handed down by the league offices. On April 22, Toronto's Chris Colabello received an <a href="http://m.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article/173879446/blue-jays-colabello-suspended-80-games" target="_blank">80-game ban</a> for steroid use, and the Blue Jays player fit the mold we had come to expect; someone who never succeeded in the big leagues used artificial help to make his name.

By April 29, news was circulating about the 80-game PED suspension <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/175200718/mlb-suspends-marlins-dee-gordon-80-games" target="_blank">handed to Dee Gordon</a>, the 2015 NL batting champ who signed a long-term deal with the Marlins prior to this season. Thin and fleet in a uniform that never seems to fit him, Gordon is a long way from the Bash Brothers. In fact, there several surprising things about this latest violation of the league substance abuse policy. We'll start with the usual motivation.
<h2>Gordon already made his money</h2>
You can see why a player struggling to make a career in the Major Leagues would do everything he could to have a good walk year. After all, the difference amounts to millions of dollars. With the Gordon suspension, you have to wonder what the circumstances were the previous year when he had by far the best showing of his career. (The Dodgers traded him for a prospect before the 2015 season.)

Now that we are into the 2016 season, those concerns were ostensibly gone. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-were-the-marlins-smart-to-sign-dee-gordon-to-an-extension.html/" target="_blank">$50 million he was guaranteed</a> over the next five years made Gordon a man who would never have to worry about money again. His kids and grandkids could do the same, if he played his cards right. The shocking part is he had that cushion and still wanted to be better than he thought he could be without PEDs.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>He played the clueless card</h2>
[caption id="attachment_73871368" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-73871368 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GettyImages-522498810.jpg" alt="MLB: The Surprising Twists of Dee Gordon's PED Suspension" width="800" height="502" /> Dee Gordon at Marlins Park | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

All sports fans yearn for the player who will admit he or she was using drugs to get an edge one way or another. Per MLB.com, Colabello gave the classic denial. "I would never, have never, will never compromise the integrity of baseball," he said. "Ever. In my life. And whether that means taking a performance-enhancing supplement, I just wouldn't do it." The problem is he did it.

Gordon said more or less the same thing. "Though I did not do so knowingly, I have been informed that test results showed I ingested something that contained prohibited substances," he said in a statement following his suspension. Here are the consequences: Gordon, a well-liked player in and around the league, takes a hit for his silly denial.
<h2>Blame the singles hitter</h2>
If baseball fans had to bet who was on the juice, most would guess a slugger of the Colabello sort or a power <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-and-steroids-3-lessons-from-jenrry-mejias-lifetime-ban.html/" target="_blank">pitcher on the fringes of the bullpen</a>. Singles hitters with speed would end up somewhere near the bottom of the list, even when they win batting titles and swipe 58 bags a year. What Gordon's suspension says is everyone has an incentive.

A-Rod had an incentive when he had that record contract and when he wanted to prove himself later in his career; Jenrry Mejia had incentive though he was risking a lifetime ban, which he got; and everyone in between has some benefit they can grasp. With the punishment amounting to a half year's salary, there is not much risk for players already set for life.

		<description><![CDATA[Here are the 3 key rule changes fans will see in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_608217" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-608217" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-492200898.jpg" alt="in game two of the National League Division Series at Dodger Stadium on October 10, 2015 in Los Angeles, California." width="757" height="484" /> Sean M.

Anyone who saw Chase Utley <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-3-crushing-dodgers-blunders-in-nlds-loss-to-the-mets.html/" target="_blank">slide in the 2015 NLDS</a> probably realized it was a historic event. Other than immortalizing the ex-Phillie in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-3-players-with-chase-utley-in-the-dirty-slide-hall-of-fame.html/" target="_blank">Dirty Slide Hall of Fame</a>, the broken leg suffered by the Mets' Ruben Tejada forced MLB officials to consider changing the rule governing approaches to second base. Indeed, an alteration of the rule has been worked out with the player's union and will take effect on Opening Day 2016 (that was yesterday, for those keeping score at home).

Baseball's front office and player's association didn't stop there, however. The two bodies collectively addressed the "neighborhood play" middle infielders use at second base, and the pace of play got its own tweaking. If you followed the changes in home plate collisions and between-innings breaks in recent years, you know how these rules have an instant impact. Here are the three key changes you'll see in baseball games this season.
<h2>1. Timed meetings on the mound</h2>
The time-honored tradition of managers or pitching coaches gathering on the mound to discuss matters will be set to a timer beginning in 2016. No longer will the umpire decide when enough is enough before breaking up the party. According to the rule change, these powwows now have a maximum duration of 30 seconds.

In <em><a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-greatest-baseball-movies-ever-made.html/" target="_blank">Bull Durham</a></em>, Kevin Costner and teammates famously discussed wedding presents and other essential topics in the gathering with their pitching coach. If that's what players on a losing team are up to on some meaningless August evening, they better prepare their answers before stepping on the bump.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_608211" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-608211" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-488745702.jpg" alt="PITTSBURGH, PA - SEPTEMBER 17: Chris Coghlan #8 of the Chicago Cubs slides into Jung Ho Kang #27 of the Pittsburgh Pirates resulting in injury in the first inning during the game at PNC Park on September 17, 2015 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Justin K. Aller/Getty Images)" width="757" height="462" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>2. Severe slides and neighborhood play: out</h2>
The biggest change comes for takeout slides at second base."Rolling block" slides resembling tackles are banned, as are kicks or swipes above the knee (seen above by Chris Coghlan in the end to Jung Ho Kang's 2015 season).

According to <a href="https://twitter.com/MLB_PR/status/702907797235744769" target="_blank">the revised rule</a>, the player has to begin sliding before touching the base; has to be able to touch the bag with his hand or foot; must be able to hold the base upon completion; and cannot change directions to make it nastier on the infielder. Runners going from home to first would be called out on interference if the rule is broken.

While these measures serve to protect, a separate rule change on the neighborhood play will actually put more infielders in harm's way. Instead of being able to mock the tag at second in order to avoid a runner barreling into the base, infielders must now definitively touch second to record the out. In sum, infielders now have to touch or the runner will be safe, and runners have fewer weapons to deploy in the takeout slide.
<h2>3. Breaks between innings shortened again</h2>
Last year, MLB installed clocks to limit the breaks between innings to two minutes and 30 seconds. According to officials, this change knocked a healthy six minutes off the average game time in 2015. Buoyed by that success, MLB and the player's union agreed to knock another 20 seconds off the break between innings, shaving it to 2:10. Now players, broadcasters, and grounds crew members will have to hustle back to their places in a flash -- almost a minute faster than they did in 2014.

What will happen to the "YMCA" presentation by the Yankee Stadium grounds crew? How many verses of "Sweet Caroline" does that allow at Fenway? What about "God Bless America," "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," and every other odd between-inning ritual performed on summer nights at the ballpark? We'll have to keep an eye on it, baseball fans. For now, we only know times are a-changing in the grand old game.

		<description><![CDATA[Will the Miami Marlins be in the NL East race? Will Clayton Kershaw finish outside the top three for NL Cy Young? Here are 5 MLB bold predictions for 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_838774" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-838774 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Clayton-Kershaw_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="511" /> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

Time has officially run out for MLB’s 32 teams to make <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-pitchers-winning-the-rotation-battles-this-spring.html/" target="_blank">one last Spring Training impression</a>, and rosters are gradually taking shape. Before the weekend is out, Adam Wainwright and Francisco Liriano will toe the rubber on the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/schedule/index.jsp#date=04/03/2016" target="_blank">afternoon of April 3</a>, and the St. Louis Cardinals and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-3-encouraging-signs-from-pittsburgh-pirates-camp.html/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> will officially kick off the 2016 regular season. Before the real action begins though, we have to play the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-hitters-who-could-bounce-back-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">prediction game</a>.

In that spirit: we are going to preview both high-profile teams and players as well as under-the-radar ones. Since Opening Day is just days away, we feel pretty confident in knowing how each 25-man roster will play out and therefore we can make some early estimations concerning how the season may go. Here are five bold predictions for the 2016 season.
<h2>1. The Blue Jays will be out of the AL East race by September</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692333" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692333" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/493792795-640x433.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="512" /> Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]

Probably more so than any other division in baseball, the American League East will be anybody’s to win in the upcoming season. As we approach April, one squad that we are not feeling is the defending-champion Toronto Blue Jays. Led by a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/year/2015/seasontype/2" target="_blank">nearly unstoppable offense</a>, Manager John Gibbons’ squad had a solid first half before taking off after the All-Star break and holding off the New York Yankees for the crown.

It has been pointed out tons of times already, but the man who led the charge last summer — lefty ace David Price — is no longer with the club and will be missed sorely. Simply put, the Jays will have to rely heavily on the young, unproven arm of Marcus Stroman to replace Price. Even if he is magically able to duplicate that success, there is not enough strong depth in the <a href="http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=tor" target="_blank">starting rotation</a>.

The bullpen has question marks and the offense, while lethal, will not be able to carry the club for an entire season. If we had to put money on it, we would pick Price’s new team, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-has-the-red-sox-rotation-actually-improved.html/" target="_blank">the Boston Red Sox</a>, and the underrated Baltimore Orioles as the co-frontrunners for the division title. Pin the Jays for a battle with the Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays to avoid the AL East cellar.

<h2>2. The Marlins will be an NL East contender</h2>
[caption id="attachment_897247" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-897247" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-491196266-640x426.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="504" /> Brian Garfinkel/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2016, the Miami Marlins will be an NL East contender. The keyword there is contender. It would be ballsy — to say the least — to predict a team other than the New York Mets or Washington Nationals to capture the division, but we could definitely see Miami being in the running for the postseason come mid-September. Looking at the experience and talent on each of the group’s five teams, it is obvious that the bunch is extremely top-heavy.

We fully expect Don Mattingly’s new team to feast on the underwhelming pitching staffs of the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies all year long, and with the way that baseball schedules work out, they will play almost a quarter of their 162 regular-season games against this pair. Even when they square off against the Mets and Nats, given the front half of their <a href="http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=mia" target="_blank">starting five and a lineup</a> that oozes with potential, we give Miami a fighting chance to be competitive with the top dogs.

New York’s young guns and Washington’s trio of Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, and Gio Gonzalez garner <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-starting-rotations-for-2016.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">most of the headlines</a>, but the top two of Wei-Yin Chen and Jose Fernandez could rival those groups for the strongest front lines in the quintet. The bullpen could be shaky, but with a lineup catapulted by spark plug Dee Gordon and filled with sluggers like Christian Yelich, Giancarlo Stanton, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-fantasy-preview-5-hitters-with-big-upside-in-2016.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Justin Bour</a>, this team should be able to provide ample run support.
<h2>3. Clayton Kershaw will finish outside the top three in NL Cy Young voting</h2>
[caption id="attachment_739169" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-739169" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Clayton-Kershaw-640x440.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="520" /> Victor Decolongon/Getty Images[/caption]

Los Angeles Dodgers southpaw <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kershcl01.shtml" target="_blank">Clayton Kershaw</a> is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-5-best-starting-pitchers-in-baseball.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">best pitcher</a> in baseball. Sure, Jake Arrieta and Dallas Keuchel are the reigning Cy Young award winners, and Zack Greinke arguably had a better 2015 season than his former teammate, but carrying the most consistent dominance of the decade still makes Kershaw the man to beat.

With that being said, we feel that there is a decent shot that the 28-year-old not only fails take home the NL hardware this year, but that he finishes outside of the top three vote-getters. This is not to say that Kershaw will struggle in 2016 — in fact we could see one of his best season’s yet — but the competition will be fierce in the senior circuit for the pitcher’s top prize.

Among the challengers, who should be up to the task of matching Kershaw start for start, are Scherzer, Fernandez, any one of the Mets’ gauntlet of starters, Arrieta, Gerrit Cole, Greinke, and Madison Bumgarner. That is an <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2015.shtml#NLcya" target="_blank">absolutely stacked field</a> of contenders and despite the lefty’s historic career, we predict that the odds will not be forever in his favor.

<h2>4. The Astros will have the best record in the American League</h2>
[caption id="attachment_936100" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-936100" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-490146002-640x398.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="470" /> Eric Christian Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Considering the fact that the Houston Astros were a playoff team in 2015 and nearly won the AL West, this prediction may not come as a huge shock. However, with the reloaded Red Sox and defending World Series-champion Kansas City Royals expected to be strong contenders for the AL pennant, some baseball pundits may overlook Houston.

Not only do they have a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-can-astros-carlos-correra-win-al-mvp-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">young MVP candidate in Carlos Correa</a>, but the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14936299/mlb-projected-lineups-all-30-teams#alwest" target="_blank">projected starting lineup</a> should be strong from top to bottom. The success of the starting pitching will hinge largely on the ability of Keuchel to show that 2015 was no fluke, but even behind the reigning AL Cy Young award winner, <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=hou" target="_blank">this unit</a> has quality arms in 19-game winner Collin McHugh, veteran Doug Fister, and innings-eater Scott Feldman.

The Astros’ bullpen may be the team’s greatest asset heading into the spring, as new stud closer Ken Giles will be joined by a potentially elite group consisting of Luke Gregerson, Will Harris, Tony Sipp, and Pat Neshek among others. The balance of Houston’s roster could easily propel them to the top of the AL in 2016.
<h2>5. The Cardinals will miss the playoffs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_718545" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-718545" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457273030-640x426.jpg" alt="MLB: 5 Bold Predictions for the 2016 Season" width="757" height="504" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

It is always tough to predict the field of postseason teams before a season even begins, as underachievers and surprises are bound to happen every year. For the past five campaigns (and <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/" target="_blank">12 out of 16 times</a> since 2000), we have been able to pencil the St. Louis Cardinals into the tournament thanks to consistent greatness. Though they only have a pair of World Series titles to show for their year-in and year-out dominance since the turn of the millennium, it would be hard to argue that St. Louis has not been the NL team of the century thus far.

Here is arguably our most bold prediction on this list: The Cards will miss the playoffs in 2016. Simply put, the NL Central is stacked (at least at the top of the division). The Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates are expected to be real championship contenders this season, and mathematically the division cannot produce more than three playoff teams in the field. True, it just happened in 2015, but we fully expect the NL to be stronger as a whole this time around.

The Marlins, Mets, and Nationals should be strong teams in the East, while the fight between the Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, and Arizona Diamondbacks could definitely produce two postseason teams. Though we expect St. Louis to be in the mix, we feel that their offense could falter and the seemingly strong <a href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=stl" target="_blank">starting rotation</a> on paper just has too many injury concerns.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_915041" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-915041" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Todd-Frazier-e1455293699106.jpg" alt="Jared Wickerham/Getty Images" width="757" height="484" /> Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

What’s fun about <a title="fantasy baseball" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/fantasy-baseball/" target="_blank">Fantasy Baseball</a>? If everyone could agree on one thing, it would probably be the joy of outsmarting the opposition. Whether you get the better of computer projections, draft rank experts, or your league opponents, proving you have the horse-sense to take a team all the way is thrilling. Those of you who find the <a title="Fantasy Baseball Preview: 5 MLB Pitchers With Big Upside in 2016" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/fantasy-baseball-preview-5-mlb-pitchers-with-big-upside-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">players with upside</a> and leave behind those who underachieve are the ones who get it done.

Of course, that’s easier said than done. You have to leave behind the statistics on occasion to follow a hunch, and the biggest challenge comes in the first few rounds of the draft. Your restraint on a big-name pick could end up being the difference in your league’s final standings. To that end, we present five players presenting real risk in the top 50 of this 2016’s draft rankings. Before you hang your hopes on these individuals, double-check the numbers.
<h2>1. Todd Frazier</h2>
We’re <a title="MLB: What Todd Frazier Means for the White Sox" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-what-todd-frazier-means-for-the-white-sox.html/" target="_blank">Todd Frazier</a> fans and love the steady power progression over the last few years, culminating in the career-high 35 HR and 43 2B in 2015. That’s a lot of pop, but there is some reason for concern in his splits. His second half (.220/.274./.390) was a steep drop off his monster first-half pace.

There is another big disparity in his home/away splits, with the meat of his production (i.e., an OPS that’s 150 points higher) coming at Great American. He won’t have such a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor" target="_blank">hitter-friendly home park</a> on Chicago’s South Side this season. Matt Carpenter or Adrian Beltre could be better picks at No. 5 or No. 6 among third basemen.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Miguel Cabrera</h2>
[caption id="attachment_843029" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-843029 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Omar-Vizquel-Jon-Durr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&lt;&gt; at Wrigley Field on August 19, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois." width="757" height="504" /> Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

<a title="Miguel Cabrera" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/miguel-cabrera/" target="_blank">Miggy’s</a> combination of bat control, eye, approach, and power still has no equal in the game. However, the man is clearly aging. Though he turns 33 in mid-April, Miguel Cabrera will play in his 14th MLB season this year. Anyone who watched him over the last few years has seen the creakiness, and while he won the batting title again<em> </em>in 2015, his HR (18) and 2B (28) totals were among his career worst.

Maybe good health and a deeper lineup with <a title="MLB: Does Justin Upton Make the Tigers the AL Central Favorites?" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-does-justin-upton-make-the-tigers-the-al-central-favorites.html/" target="_blank">J-UP aboard</a> could return Cabrera to 2013 levels, but Father Time is <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/164329798/ian-desmond-set-for-next-chapter-of-career" target="_blank">rarely so kind</a> to ballplayers. We would go for him in the early 20s of a draft rather than the average ranking (11th) we see across the board.
<h2>3. Troy Tulowitzki</h2>
Entering his 11th season, Tulo has definitely earned the “fragile" label. He hasn’t played more than 128 games or hit over 30 HR since 2011, and he’ll enter 2016 at age 31. Granted, Toronto has a great hitter’s park and he’ll be in one of the deepest lineups in baseball, but the rankings that have him in the top 20 are far too bullish on <a title="Troy Tulowitzki" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/troy-tulowitzki/" target="_blank">Tulowitzki</a>. His offensive stats were barely above the league average (102 OPS+) last season. We see him as more of a sound pick around the 60th spot in the draft.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Corey Kluber</h2>
[caption id="attachment_945718" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-945718" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-491180814.jpg" alt="Boston Red Sox v Cleveland Indians" width="757" height="504" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Talk about getting burned by a great player. Following his 2014 Cy Young campaign, Corey Kluber led the AL with 16 losses, and he didn’t pitch much worse than he did the year before. Besides leading the league with 4 CG, he posted a 1.05 WHIP and 2.97 FIP with 245 SO. No, that doesn’t sound like 16 losses to us, either.

The Klubot’s chief disadvantage is his team. You don’t know if the Indians will score 10 runs or none on any given day, and we don’t see that situation changing much in 2016. We would prefer playing it safer with lower picks like <a title="MLB: 5 Reasons Dallas Keuchel Deserves the 2015 AL Cy Young" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-5-reasons-dallas-keuchel-deserves-the-2015-al-cy-young.html/" target="_blank">Dallas Keuchel</a> or Matt Harvey, two pitchers more likely to collect valuable wins.
<h2>5. Carlos Gonzalez</h2>
Like former teammate Tulo, CarGo is a baffling Fantasy performer. Those who stuck with him in 2015 following his first-half funk (13 HR, 35 RBI in 82 G) were treated to a fat second half (27 HR, 62 RBI in 71 G). So which one will you get, and will you already be in a hole your team can’t climb out of by the All-Star break? These questions should give you pause when drafting him anywhere below 50th. Finally, he remains a trade candidate for <a title="MLB: What’s Wrong With the Colorado Rockies in 2016" href="http://www.wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-whats-wrong-with-the-colorado-rockies-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">a weak Colorado team</a>. His road splits leave something to be desired.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_793092" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-793092 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Max-Scherzer-e1430147334407.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="546" /> Win McNamee/Getty Images[/caption]

So much could change between now and April 3, when the 2016 MLB season is <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/148055820/major-league-baseball-reveals-2016-schedule" target="_blank">tentatively scheduled to begin</a>. It’s already been a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/?ref=TN" target="_blank">hectic offseason</a> with mammoth player signings and mega-trades seemingly happening every other day. As of this week though, some teams are clearly ahead of the game, stuffing their Christmas stockings with plenty of strong arms for next year. MLB.com’s Paul Casella <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/160033952/top-5-pitching-rotations-during-mlb-offseason" target="_blank">recently revealed</a> his top five pitching rotations in baseball, ranking them based on the collective WAR for the current projected starting group. So we decided to tackle the task, too (although we base our list on personal opinion).

Casella’s list is somewhat similar to ours, as we both have the same top three rotations (although our No. 1 and No. 3 group have swapped positions). While his list includes the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians at No. 5 and No. 4 respectively, we did not include them in our countdown. The Dodgers and Indians, along with the St. Louis Cardinals, were strong candidates for inclusion, but just missed the cut. Before we unveil the rankings, here are a few interesting notes regarding our selections:
<ul>
	<li>Four of the groups are from the National League and just one is from the American League.</li>
	<li>Three of the teams on the list made the playoffs last year (one made the World Series, one lost in the NLCS, and one lost in the ALDS).</li>
	<li>Three of the five teams have either lost one noteworthy member of their 2015 rotation or added a marquee arm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. San Francisco Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828406" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-828406" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-478916856-640x410.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="485" /> Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 rotation</span>: Madison Bumgarner, Johnny Cueto, Jeff Samardzija, Jake Peavy, Matt Cain
<span style="text-decoration: underline">X-Factor</span>: Samardzija

Whether or not the San Francisco Giants can continue their <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SFG/" target="_blank">crazy pattern</a> — alternating seasons of missing the postseason and then winning the World Series — will hinge largely on the success of the <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=sf" target="_blank">starting pitching</a>. This group, which already <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/pitching/year/2015/seasontype/2" target="_blank">ranks ninth</a> in baseball in ERA, figures to be even better in 2016 with the additions of Cueto and Samardzija. You basically know what you’re going to get with Bumgarner, one of the most reliable aces of the past few seasons. Cueto is still on the right side of 30, coming off a season where he played an instrumental role in the Kansas City Royals’ championship.

The Giants are banking on Samardzija’s ability to forget about his underwhelming 2015 campaign in Chicago and rekindle his magic with a return to the NL. San Fran will have options for the fourth and fifth starters, as Peavy and Cain represent proven veterans whose careers are slowing down, but they still have the experience. Mr. No-No Chris Heston is also a more youthful, intriguing option for the back end of the group.

<h2>4. Houston Astros</h2>
[caption id="attachment_840995" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-840995 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Dallas-Keuchel-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="460" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 rotation</span>: Dallas Keuchel, Collin McHugh, Mike Fiers, Lance McCullers, Scott Feldman
<span style="text-decoration: underline">X-Factor</span>: McCullers

The Houston Astros stunned the world last season as they controlled the AL West for much of the year, ultimately making the playoffs as a wild card. They advanced to the ALDS before bowing out — but it’d be hard to find anyone who had this team in the elite eight before 2015 began. Obviously, much of their Cinderella run can be attributed to the performance of AL Cy Young award winner Keuchel, but this was a <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=hou" target="_blank">solid rotation</a> all-around too.

Unlike San Francisco, Houston will likely trot out a similar starting five next season and should be confident in Keuchel’s ability to repeat at least some of last season’s success. McHugh should be in the prime of his career right now, at 28 years old; he is coming off back-to-back great seasons (earning 30 combined wins). After spending the first four-and-a-half years of his career in Milwaukee, Fiers adjusted well to his move to Houston and could be a solid No. 3. At 22, McCullers is the X-factor and will improve the rotation significantly — if he can build on his solid rookie year in 2015. Feldman and Brad Peacock could battle it out for the last spot in the rotation, but for now we give the edge to Feldman.

<h2>3. Chicago Cubs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_867790" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-867790" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jake-Arrieta-Justin-K.-Aller-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 rotation</span>: Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta, John Lackey, Kyle Hendricks, Jason Hammel
<span style="text-decoration: underline">X-Factor</span>: Arrieta

The Chicago Cubs have been <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-cubs-complete-their-holiday-wish-list-with-jason-heyward-deal.html/" target="_blank">mighty busy this offseason</a> and may not be done yet. While this team is stacked with fresh faces in the infield and outfield, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=chc" target="_blank">their starting rotation</a> is full of veterans. That’s not to say that these five are over the hill; in fact they’re far from it. Starting with the Cubs, these last three rotations have the greatest potential to be truly elite next year, in our opinion.

Making an absurd amount of money and having played in Boston and now Chicago, Lester is hard to pin as underrated. But when discussing stud lefties like Clayton Kershaw, David Price, and Bumgarner, Lester’s name seems to come up less frequently (along with Chris Sale). It may seem odd to call the reigning NL Cy Young award winner, Arrieta, the X-factor for this rotation, but we want to make sure that he isn’t another flash in the pan, like Brandon Webb or Pat Hentgen.

At 37 years old, Lackey seems to get better and better and is hoping to continue his NL Central dominance after spending a season and a half with the Cardinals. Hendricks is clearly the youngster of the group and fits the bill as a prototypical fourth starter, a guy who can eat up innings and throw lots of strikes. Hammel went 10-7 with a 3.74 ERA in 2015, pretty darn good for a No. 5 starter.

<h2>2. New York Mets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_818336" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-818336 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-475564902.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="531" /> Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 rotation</span>: Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey, Steven Matz, Zack Wheeler/Bartolo Colon
<span style="text-decoration: underline">X-Factor</span>: Harvey

After 2015’s incredible run to the World Series, everybody knows about the New York Mets’ impressive starting rotation. They have barely done anything this offseason — and can you blame them? Barring injury, we’d be shocked to see this group of five change much before spring training. DeGrom is projected to be the No. 1, and after his masterful playoff performances, he’s earned it.

It’s tough to say who manager Terry Collins will slate as the second starter, but <a href="http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=nym" target="_blank">MLB.com’s Mets depth chart</a> currently has Syndergaard occupying that spot. The right-hander may get overshadowed a bit by deGrom and Harvey, but he’s a solid No. 2. Speaking of Harvey, we put him as our X-factor for the Mets' rotation. Let’s see if the outspoken hurler can increase his workload in 2016, his second season removed from Tommy John surgery.

Matz could probably be a two starter in many other rotations, but the Mets like him fine where he is, and if any of the top three guns get hurt, Matz should slide up a rung. The No. 5 spot in New York could be a toss-up between Wheeler (who is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-players-poised-for-a-comeback-in-2016.html/2/" target="_blank">recovering from TJ surgery</a> and may be able to pitch by June) and the veteran fan-favorite Colon. Either way, the Mets should be fine as far as pitching is concerned.

<h2>1. Washington Nationals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_686650" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-686650" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/453356766-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Photo by Kevin Liles/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 rotation</span>: Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez, Tanner Roark, Joe Ross
<span style="text-decoration: underline">X-Factor</span>: Strasburg

Yes, the Washington Nationals lost Jordan Zimmermann to the Detroit Tigers and yes, they are projected to still <a href="http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=was" target="_blank">have the best rotation</a> in baseball. It all starts with one of the filthiest, most dominant pitchers in the game, Scherzer. He’s about as good of a No. 1 option as you’re going to get.

One could say that Strasburg has been the X-factor of the Nationals rotation throughout pretty much his entire career. When you have that much raw talent and are injured as much as Strasburg has been in his still young stages, that’s what’s going to happen. After injuries plagued much of the first half of his season, Strasburg dominated in rehab outings with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs and continued his dominance at the major league level at the tail-end of the season.

Gonzalez is an underrated pitcher and a terrific candidate to lead this group as a No. 3. The back-end of the rotation is where it gets dicey. With the departure of Zimmermann, Roark likely becomes a figure in the rotation. The 29-year-old has spent his three seasons in the bigs in and out of the bullpen, making 12 starts in 2015. Ross is the other piece, along with infielder Trea Turner who came over to D.C. from San Diego in the Steven Souza/Wil Myers three-team trade. Ross showed great poise and promise in the second half of 2015 with the Nationals.

		<description><![CDATA[From the Chicago Cubs to the Toronto Blue Jays, there will be many loaded lineups for the 2016 MLB season. Here are the top five projected ones.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_848731" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-848731 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Donaldson-and-Tulowitzki-Tom-Szczerbowski-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="521" /> Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Continuing our series of way-too-early projections for the 2016 MLB season, today we look at which teams could have the top lineups. First, we broke down who we thought at this point, was slated to have the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-starting-rotations-for-2016.html/" target="_blank">best starting five</a> for the season, with the Washington Nationals taking the top spot. Then, the New York Yankees earned our No. 1 position for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-bullpens-for-2016.html/" target="_blank">potential best bullpen</a>.</p>
<p>So, the task of starting with all 30 MLB teams and selecting just five for this countdown was difficult. We took many factors into account. The group&#8217;s 2015 performance, their off-season additions and subtractions, and of course, early stat projections came into play. While we utilized many sources to make our final rankings, one of the more helpful tools was the work conducted at <a href="http://www.rotochamp.com/" target="_blank">RotoChamp.com</a>. The site, which does &#8220;projections, lineups, rankings, and web app for (fantasy) draft prep and in-draft help" has their latest 2016 regular season statistical estimations for every single roster in the big leagues.</p>
<p>In terms of which particular statistics we looked at, the ones commonly viewed as vital to an offense&#8217;s success (AVG, HR, RBI, SB, OBP, SLG, OPS) were important. While it is still January and many more moves and changes will be made to these lineups, we based our top five on not only who makes up the starting nine, but where they are currently estimated to hit in the lineup. Before we unveil the list, here&#8217;s an overview of some interesting facts about these rankings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three of the teams did not make the top five for either the starting rotation or bullpen list.</li>
<li>One team in this countdown was in the top starting rotation list and the other made the bullpen group.</li>
<li>Two of the teams are from the American League and three are from the National League.</li>
<li>Three of the teams made the 2015 postseason; one lost in the NLDS, one lost in the ALCS, and one lost in the NLCS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_873249" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-873249" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-492086862-640x401.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="474" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 lineup</span>: RF Yasiel Puig, 2B Chase Utley, 1B Adrian Gonzalez, LF Andre Ethier, SS Corey Seager, 3B Justin Turner, C Yasmani Grandal, CF Joc Pederson</p>
<p><a href="http://rotochamp.com/baseball/TeamPage.aspx?TeamID=LAD&amp;StatType=RotoChamp" target="_blank">This starting nine</a> (eight without the pitcher) has few, if any holes. It&#8217;s got sufficient power with Puig, Gonzalez, and Pederson, loads of veteran leadership with Gonzalez, Ethier, and Utley, and a nice mix of youthful talent with Puig, Seager, and Pederson. What prevents this group from ranking any higher though are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-5-ways-the-dodgers-have-gotten-worse-during-the-offseason.html/" target="_blank">the question marks</a>.</p>
<p>Can Puig stay healthy and revert back to his 2014 form? Does Utley have anything left? Is this the year when Gonzalez finally starts slowing down? Will highly-touted studs, Seager and Pederson, pan out? Our best guess is that most of these questions will be answered sooner rather than later. If some of the starters fall apart, the team has a decent bench consisting of Carl Crawford, Scott Van Slyke, and Trayce Thompson among others.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Colorado Rockies</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_856017" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-856017" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Nolan-Arenado-Colorado-Rockies-v-San-Diego-wjO95YRDIEll.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="549" /> Denis Poroy/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 lineup</span>: CF Charlie Blackmon, SS Jose Reyes, RF Carlos Gonzalez, 3B Nolan Arenado, LF Corey Dickerson, 2B DJ LeMahieu, 1B Mark Reynolds, C Nick Hundley</p>
<p>Obviously, the Colorado Rockies&#8217; status on this list is largely based on the fact that right fielder Gonzalez is still with the team. If CarGo <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-trade-rumors-will-the-angels-get-carlos-gonzalez.html/" target="_blank">ends up being traded</a> before Opening Day, Colorado likely gets the boot off of the rankings. However, even without their star hitter, the <a href="http://rotochamp.com/baseball/TeamPage.aspx?TeamID=COL&amp;StatType=RotoChamp" target="_blank">Rockies lineup</a> is pretty solid. It starts with Blackmon at the top, a 29-year-old left-handed bat who broke out in a big way in 2015. He posted a stat line of .287/.347/.797 and had plenty of speed to burn with his 43 steals.</p>
<p>If Reyes is healthy, he&#8217;s still very capable of getting hot for weeks at a time, as evidenced by his 111 total bases and 82 hits in just 69 games with Toronto before moving to Colorado last year. Backing up Gonzalez is the Rockies&#8217; MVP from 2015, Arenado. The 24-year-old had a monster season and along with Dickerson, showcases some serious pop in the middle of this lineup. LeMahieu mans second base and Hundley is slated for the starting catcher&#8217;s job, both of whom sandwich new acquisition Reynolds in the seven spot. Reynolds should be able to produce big power numbers while calling Coors Field home.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Baltimore Orioles</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_706490" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706490" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/452504800-640x382.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="453" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 lineup</span>: LF Nolan Reimold, 2B Jonathan Schoop, 3B Manny Machado, CF Adam Jones, 1B Mark Trumbo, C Matt Wieters, DH Caleb Joseph, SS J.J. Hardy, RF Jimmy Paredes</p>
<p>Like the Rockies, the Baltimore Orioles <a href="http://rotochamp.com/baseball/TeamPage.aspx?TeamID=BAL&amp;StatType=RotoChamp" target="_blank">projected lineup</a> could very well take a significant hit in the next few weeks. Slugging first baseman/designated hitter Chris Davis, who represents the team&#8217;s best pure power threat, is a free agent and may be on the move this month. Right now, the departure of Davis appears to be a bit more likely than that of CarGo. However, the O&#8217;s should be able to sustain losing the big lefty bat.</p>
<p>Along with their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-bullpens-for-2016.html/4/" target="_blank">stellar bullpen</a>, Baltimore&#8217;s bats are balanced and dangerous. The team has options in the outfield and thus, at the top of their starting nine. Reimold can play outfield but also has enough production to be a designated hitter. Schoop has really come on in his first two full seasons in MLB, setting the table nicely for the middle of this crew. The three-four combination of Machado and Jones is both salivating for O&#8217;s fans and scary for the rest of the AL East.</p>
<p>Trumbo will enter his first season in Baltimore and provides both majestic power behind Machado and Jones, and plenty of versatility in the field. Wieters is a walking injury, but at this point is about on par with the catching options currently with division-rivals Boston and Tampa Bay. Hardy has been a constant force in all parts of the Orioles&#8217; lineup for a few years now, and we don&#8217;t expect that to change any time soon. Even without Davis, this team should be able to get close to their <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting/sort/homeRuns/order/true#" target="_blank">third-place HR ranking</a> from a season ago.</p>

<h2>2. Chicago Cubs</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_870886" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-870886" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Javier-Baez-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 lineup</span>: 2B Ben Zobrist, CF Jason Heyward, 1B Anthony Rizzo, 3B Kris Bryant, LF Kyle Schwarber, RF Jorge Soler, C Miguel Montero, SS Addison Russell</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been lots of talk about how the Chicago Cubs&#8217; pitching staff seems to be one of the best this year. With Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta, and John Lackey at the front, this talk is legitimate. What we&#8217;re most curious about is how <a href="http://rotochamp.com/baseball/TeamPage.aspx?TeamID=CHC&amp;StatType=RotoChamp" target="_blank">this young lineup</a> will respond to rising expectations. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-did-the-cubs-help-or-hurt-their-2016-world-series-chances.html/" target="_blank">Significant upgrades</a> at second base and in center field put this unit on pace to be the best group in the National League for the coming season. We love the idea of the Zobrist/Joe Maddon reunion and enough cannot be said about the value of Zobrist&#8217;s ability to play multiple positions.</p>
<p>After a quick stint in St. Louis, Heyward will now move to both a new city and a new position. At least on offense, we don&#8217;t see him having much trouble adjusting to a new ballpark. The big, young bats of Rizzo, Bryant, and Schwarber have mega-potential and we predict their continued growth in 2016. You could certainly do worse than Soler, Montero, and Russell as your six through eight hitters, and Maddon&#8217;s bench including Chris Coghlan, David Ross, and the promising Javier Baez should be among the best in the league too.</p>

<h2>1. Toronto Blue Jays</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_669887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-669887" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/488072915-640x407.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="481" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 lineup</span>: LF Dalton Pompey, 3B Josh Donaldson, RF Jose Bautista, 1B Edwin Encarnacion, SS Troy Tulowitzki, DH Chris Colabello, C Russell Martin, CF Kevin Pillar, 2B Ryan Goins</p>
<p>Stacked. That is likely one of the first words that enters your brain when thinking about the Toronto Blue Jays&#8217; offensive onslaught. Up and down <a href="http://rotochamp.com/baseball/TeamPage.aspx?TeamID=TOR&amp;StatType=RotoChamp" target="_blank">this entire lineup</a>, there is something special at every stop. The team will bring back a similar cast of characters as a year ago &#8212; a season that brought them to the ALCS &#8212; and their batting statistics were quite impressive.</p>
<p>Led the league <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/batting" target="_blank">by a wide margin</a> in runs scored with 891? Check. Finish No. 1 in doubles at a staggering 308 two-baggers? You betcha. Pace MLB with an impressive 232 long balls? Yep. We could continue listing all of the offensive statistics that this group led the league in, but that may take all night.</p>
<p>With the recent Ben Revere trade to the Washington Nationals, Pompey will attempt to step up as the engine that gets this lineup going. The Donaldson/Bautista/Encarncion/Tulowitzki two through five production is unmatched. Martin is still producing big time, not only as the starting catcher, but as a strong force at the bottom of this powerhouse. Maybe Canada should be worried a bit about the starting rotation after the loss of David Price, but their lineup should be the best of them all again.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox have recently added elite closers to their bullpen for 2016. Here are the top five projected units for next season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_879007" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-879007" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-493991958-640x401.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="474" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s been a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/?ref=TN" target="_blank">crazy off-season</a> for Major League Baseball with a bevy of free-agent signings and numerous blockbuster trades. Mega-deals for stud starters <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-why-david-price-alone-cant-save-the-red-sox.html/" target="_blank">David Price</a> and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-zack-greinke-deal-sets-the-bar-at-34-million-a-year.html/" target="_blank">Zack Greinke</a> have garnered most of the headlines, but there have been many crucial pickups by way of the bullpen arms as well. From former Philadelphia Phillies closer Ken Giles <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14332470/philadelphia-phillies-trade-ken-giles-houston-astros" target="_blank">going to the Houston Astros</a> to Craig Kimbrel <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/157272300/craig-kimbrel-traded-to-red-sox-from-padres" target="_blank">moving to the Boston Red Sox</a>, a handful of teams will need to adjust to new ninth-inning options in 2016.

Of course, the biggest domino of them all <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14454106/reds-deal-closer-aroldis-chapman-yankees" target="_blank">fell earlier </a> as the Cincinnati Reds traded lefty flamethrower Aroldis Chapman to the New York Yankees for four minor league players. The deal has not come without plenty of controversy though, as Chapman is still <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2015/12/30/new-york-council-speaker-says-yankees-wrong-acquire-aroldis-chapman-cincinnati-reds/78085946/" target="_blank">in the midst</a> of a domestic violence investigation. We recently took a look at our <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-starting-rotations-for-2016.html/" target="_blank">top five projected starting rotations</a> for next season, so now it’s time to give our opinion on the top projected bullpens in baseball for 2016.

Certainly, injuries and/or more off-season moves could affect these rankings, but this is what we have for now. The fact that teams like the Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers — with elite closers Mark Melancon and Kenley Jansen in the fold, respectively — were left off the list (and the honorable mentions, too), speak to how difficult of a task it was to just pick five.
<h2>Honorable mentions: Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants</h2>
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Houston Astros</h2>
[caption id="attachment_899496" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-899496" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-490574424-640x405.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="479" /> Drew Hallowell/Getty Images[/caption]

<i>*Note: The picture above shows recently-acquired pitcher Ken Giles, who is projected to be the new Houston Astros closer.</i>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 bullpen</span>: Ken Giles (closer), Luke Gregerson, Tony Sipp, Will Harris, Josh Fields</h2>
Like the Yankees, the Astros <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14332470/philadelphia-phillies-trade-ken-giles-houston-astros" target="_blank">enhanced their already formidable bullpen</a> with a trade this month, adding Giles in a deal with the Phillies. The right-hander took over the closer’s role after Philadelphia parted ways with enigmatic reliever Jonathan Papelbon late in the 2015 campaign. Though the Phils’ status as one of the worst teams in baseball limited Giles’ save opportunities last season, he proved to be reliable with 15 conversions and a sparkling 1.80 ERA.

The Giles pickup moves last year’s Astros closer, Luke Gregerson, back to his more suitable setup role. The righty excelled as the ninth inning man last year though, notching 31 saves and posting a solid 3.10 ERA. Tony Sipp combines with Gregerson to form a nice righty/lefty setup duo, and he is coming off a solid season as well. Aside from the top three, Will Harris, Josh Fields, and submarine pitcher Pat Neshek <a href="http://houston.astros.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=hou" target="_blank">bring plenty of solid depth</a> to this unit. Interestingly, the Astros are the only team in the bigs who crack both our top projected rotations and top projected bullpens, as they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-top-5-projected-starting-rotations-for-2016.html/3/" target="_blank">were No. 4 among starters</a>.

<h2>4. St. Louis Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706372" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706372" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456170902-640x453.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="537" /> Norm Hall/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 bullpen</span>: Trevor Rosenthal (closer), Kevin Siegrist, Seth Maness, Jonathan Broxton, Tyler Lyons</h2>
As was the case with the Astros, the St. Louis Cardinals make the cut over the likes of the Red Sox and San Francisco Giants <a href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=stl" target="_blank">simply due to depth</a>. At the top of their relief corps is one of the best closers in the MLB, Trevor Rosenthal. The young right-hander is just 25 years old and throwing absolute gas on a consistent basis. That should scare the rest of the National League. Then you have Kevin Siegrist, one of the more underrated setup men in baseball. After some ups and downs over his first two seasons, the lefty put it all together in 2015, posting a 7-1 record and 2.17 ERA in 81 games (half of the Cards’ 162 games.)

Seth Maness is another St. Louis reliever who should be entering the prime of his career. His past success indicates that he should bounce back from his recent mediocre output. Jonathan Broxton is clearly not what he once was in Los Angeles, but the big guy provides intrigue in the middle of this group and can still strike out plenty of hitters. The Cardinals relievers <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2015.shtml" target="_blank">ranked first in all of baseball</a> in wins above average for their position with a stunning 4.4 mark in 2015 — and they should be able to continue that success this year.

<h2>3. Baltimore Orioles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_888564" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-888564" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-477618356-640x419.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="496" /> Mitchell Layton/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 bullpen</span>: Zach Britton (closer), Darren O’Day, T.J. McFarland, Brian Matusz, Jason Garcia</h2>
In all honesty, if the Baltimore Orioles had not <a href="http://www.camdenchat.com/2015/12/14/10147932/orioles-news-darren-oday-contract-signed" target="_blank">re-signed setup man Darren O’Day</a>, they would not be in this countdown. What O’Day brings to the table is immensely important to the Orioles bullpen success. First though, they feature one of the best little-known closers in the majors with Zach Britton. The southpaw has been with the O’s for his entire career, but began his baseball journey as a starter. After struggling in his first three seasons, Britton was moved to the closer position before the 2014 season and has been terrific ever since. He has two straight seasons of ERAs under 2 and has 73 combined saves as well.

Back to O’Day, the man with the quirky delivery complements Britton nicely and has been everything that Baltimore could have asked for since he came over from the Texas Rangers before the 2012 season. His career 1.01 WHIP is astonishing. T.J. McFarland is another lefty in this bullpen and <a href="http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=bal" target="_blank">will look to recover</a> from a somewhat rough 2015. Similar to Britton, Brian Matusz came to Baltimore as a starter and faltered, but has been electric as a reliever. He has been sharp for a while now, performing well in the middle relief and setup roles.

<h2>2. Kansas City Royals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_877649" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-877649" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Wade-Davis-League-Championship-Toronto-Blue-tI_oeWeWgK9l.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 bullpen</span>: Wade Davis (closer), Kelvin Herrera, Luke Hochevar, Joakim Soria, Brian Flynn</h2>
The defending World Series champions are projected to have the second-best bullpen in all of baseball in 2016, according to our rankings. Despite the late season loss of former closer Greg Holland to injury, his shoes were admirably filled by Wade Davis, a key cog in the Kansas City Royals’ championship. Davis saved 17 games in 18 chances and his WHIP of 0.79 was minuscule.

Behind Davis <a href="http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=kc" target="_blank">in this group</a> is the dominant, filthy arm of Kelvin Herrera. The young stud consistently hits in the upper 90s on his fastball and is one of the more difficult relievers to figure out. Luke Hochevar and Joakim Soria both provide veteran leadership on this club and are also coming off of great 2015 seasons. KC’s relief crew ranked third in all of baseball last season with their 4.1 wins above average mark. If they are going to make a serious bid at a repeat this year, expect their bullpen to be a critical part of that success.

<h2>1. New York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_779280" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-779280" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/110106343-640x456.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="540" /> J. Meric/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline">Projected 2016 bullpen</span>: Aroldis Chapman (closer), Andrew Miller, Dellin Betances, James Pazos, Branden Pinder</h2>
The <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/team/depth_chart/index.jsp?c_id=nyy" target="_blank">projected Yankees bullpen</a> for 2016 is the definition of an embarrassment of riches. As of now, they have three elite arms among their relievers, guys who could be closers on any other team and be pretty darn good at it. Let’s start with the newest member of the Yanks, Chapman. Arguably the best closer in baseball, we all know about how filthy the lefty’s stuff is. His resume speaks for itself, and barring any possible suspension stemming from the domestic violence investigation, Chapman should continue his utter dominance in the Bronx.

As if they needed another strong candidate for the ninth-inning position, the Yankees have two more in Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances. Miller is probably the second-most un-hittable lefty of all relief pitchers after Chapman and the only things that can hold the lanky hurler back are injury and control issues. Betances burst onto the scene over the past two years. His numbers back up the wide-ranging repertoire of pitches. If Betances is now the seventh-inning guy for the Bombers, the rest of MLB needs to be on high alert from the sixth frame onward.

The relatively low-profile arms of James Pazos and Branden Pinder round out MLB.com’s projected top five pitchers in the Yankees bullpen, but they should have some depth in their rotation too — if they decide to hang onto Ivan Nova. The Yankees <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/pitching/sort/savePct/type/expanded/order/true" target="_blank">ranked second in baseball</a> in save percentage last season, and they should be at or near the top again in 2016.

		<description><![CDATA[Max Scherzer just signed a massive deal with the Washington Nationals. How does it compare to the contracts received by other elite pitchers in baseball?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_720289" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-720289 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456758278.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/wsh/washington-nationals" target="_blank">Washington Nationals</a> made a major splash in the free agency pool back in January by signing <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/scherma01.shtml" target="_blank">Max Scherzer</a> to a massive <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12190547/max-scherzer-closing-new-multiyear-contract" target="_blank">seven-year deal, worth a reported $210 million</a>. Not only were the Nationals a contender to win the World Series, with a powerful lineup and top-notch rotation, but this move easily made them an early-season favorite for the title.

Scherzer, a former Cy Young winner, was suddenly receiving the type of money that is usually reserved for the best of the best at the pitcher position. Time will see if he proves to be a worthwhile investment, although the Nats currently sit in first place of the NL East.

With that being said, let’s look at how the deal stacks up to the biggest contracts for a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball history.

&nbsp;

<h2>5. Felix Hernandez, Seattle Mariners</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748315" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-748315 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Felix-Hernandez-Seattle-Mariners.jpg" alt="Jeff Gross/Getty Images" width="757" height="520" /> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

&nbsp;

Contract: 7 years, $175 million

<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hernafe02.shtml" target="_blank">Felix Hernandez</a> is one of the best hurlers in Major League Baseball, and the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/sea/seattle-mariners" target="_blank">Seattle Mariners</a> made sure to pay him accordingly. At 28-years-old, King Felix is still on the better side of 30, and the Mariners have him locked up until 2019 (with a team option for 2020). He has certainly rewarded their faith in him by posting ridiculous numbers. In 2014, Hernandez finished the year with an American League (AL) leading 2.14 ERA (earned run average), to go along with 248 strikeouts. He also finished sixth in the AL in WAR (wins above replacement) with a total of 6.7, and second in the league in Cy Young voting.

Hernandez has already been worth the money for the Mariners.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Justin Verlander, Detroit Tigers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_724940" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-724940 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456592018.jpg" alt="Rob Carr/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

Contract: 7 years, $180 million

The <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/det/detroit-tigers" target="_blank">Detroit Tigers</a>' ace may have seen a decline in his numbers over the past few years, but there is no doubt that he has earned top-dollar. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/verlaju01.shtml" target="_blank">Justin Verlander</a> is an absolute workhouse, and has led the American League in innings pitched a total of three times in his career. There was a span of time where Verlander was practically un-hittable. From 2009-2012, he led the AL in strikeouts three-out-four years, and in 2011 he was one of the best players in baseball. Period. Just Verlander was rewarded with multiple honors that year, including the AL Cy Young, AL MVP, Major League Player of the Year, and the AL pitching title.

<h2>3. C.C. Sabathia, New York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748410" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-748410 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/C.C.-Sabathia.jpg" alt="Mike McGinnis/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

Contract: 8 years, $186 million

<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sabatc.01.shtml" target="_blank">C.C. Sabathia</a> signed with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees" target="_blank">New York Yankees</a> back in 2009 and, although he hasn’t been the same pitcher he was when he signed the deal (injuries have certainly played a factor), the New York faithful will always be grateful for his contribution to the Yankees. Now 34, Sabathia was an absolute monster on the mound and, for a while, was the guy you’d want pitching if the game was on the line. No matter what happens for the rest of his career, the fact remains, the Yankees would never have won the World Series in 2009 without C.C. Sabathia.

<h2>2. Max Scherzer, Washington Nationals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706327" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706327 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Max-Scherzer-640x411.jpg" alt="Source: Leon Halip/Getty Images" width="757" height="486" /> Source: Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

Contract: 7 years, $210 million

<a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/scherma01.shtml" target="_blank">Max Scherzer</a>'s  deal puts him second on the list of the all-time biggest contracts for a starting pitcher in MLB history. At $210 million, it’s time for Scherzer to prove that he can be “the man." Yes, the Nationals have a stacked rotation, but for this kind of money, they’re expecting him to be lights out. And, over the past two seasons he has been, especially in 2013. That season he went 21-3, with a 2.90 ERA, and earned his first Cy Young Award. If the Washington Nationals get that guy, it’ll have been worth writing that fat check.

<h2>1. Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>

Contract: 7 years, $215 million

Los Angeles Dodger <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kershcl01.shtml" target="_blank">Clayton Kershaw</a> is hands down the best pitcher in baseball. He is more than deserving of the biggest contract for a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball history. Honestly, the numbers don’t do his dominance justice. But, just so you can see why he got this deal, let’s take a look at just a few of Kershaw’s accomplishments. In his career so far, Kershaw has already won three Cy Young awards and an MVP. He’s led the National League in WAR for the past three years in a row, and also had the lowest ERA in the league for the four straight, including two seasons with an ERA under 2.0.

Simply put, this is Clayton Kershaw’s world, and we’re all just living in it.

		<description><![CDATA[For the first time since money was printed, the Yankees will not have one of the highest-paid MLB players.  Here are the 8 biggest earners of 2015.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are no <a title="New York Yankees" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/new-york-yankees/" target="_blank">New York Yankees</a> on this list. For that reason, this article was subject to an endless run of fact-checking and levels of editorial scrutiny never before seen in the history of Sports Cheat Sheet. After months of painstaking research and consultation with legal, we have confirmed none of the eight highest-paid <a title="Major League Baseball" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/major-league-baseball/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> players will wore a Yankees uniform over the recently concluded 2015 MLB season.

Before the Steinbrenner family can file an appeal and retroactively overpay <a title="James Shields" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/james-shields/" target="_blank">James Shields</a> just because, we submit the top MLB player salaries for 2015. Only the annual salaries are used, so contracts with huge average amounts that are deferred to later dates (we’re looking at you, <a title="Max Scherzer" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/max-scherzer/" target="_blank">Max Scherzer</a>) are not included.
<h2>4. Robinson Cano, Seattle Mariners (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_749962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749962 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456027904.jpg" alt="Oakland Athletics v Seattle Mariners" width="757" height="561" /> Stephen Brashear/Getty Images[/caption]

Cano used to be a Yankee, then something strange happened. When it came time for him to get his nine-figure contract, the Yankees weren’t the ones pitching him the highest number. Despite New York’s seven-year, $175 million offer, Cano had a Rodney Dangerfield moment and declared he “<a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/12/13/robinson-cano-yankees-trade-barbs-about-disrespect/" target="_blank">didn’t get respect</a>" from his old team. The All-Star second baseman packed his bags and headed out to Seattle, where he received a 10-year deal valued at <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/seattle-mariners/robinson-cano/" target="_blank">$24 million</a> per year.

So far it’s worked out fine. Despite a big drop in home runs (the Yankee Stadium effect), the 32-year-old Cano maintained his imposing presence in the batting order and came in fifth in American League MVP voting in 2014. While his value is sure to decline as he approaches 40 at the same annual salary, Seattle was comfortable paying for short-term performance.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Prince Fielder, Texas Rangers (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_749986" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749986 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/486252309.jpg" alt="Houston Astros v Texas Rangers" width="757" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Prince Fielder certainly strikes a Ruthian figure in the batter’s box, and the slugging <a title="Texas Rangers" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/texas-rangers/" target="_blank">Rangers</a> first baseman gets paid on the same scale the Babe did in his day. Texas didn’t sign him to his nine-year deal worth $214 million (Detroit did that), but they will be responsible for about $20 million of his annual salary (<a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/texas-rangers/prince-fielder/" target="_blank">$24 million</a> in 2015) until the end of his contract after the 2020 season.

So far, that trade has been a bust for the Rangers. The 30-year-old Fielder only played 42 games (3 HR, 16 RBIs) for Texas in 2014 before going on the disabled list for the rest of the season following <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/10990604/prince-fielder-texas-rangers-neck-surgery" target="_blank">neck surgery</a>. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Felix Hernandez, Seattle Mariners (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750019" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750019 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/455002360.jpg" alt="Houston Astros v Seattle Mariners" width="757" height="584" /> Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

Also in the $24 million club (tied for fifth through eighth place in MLB salary for 2015) is Felix Hernandez, ace extraordinaire for Seattle. Hernandez, who did not feel disrespected by Seattle’s offer of $175 million for seven years, will be paid handsomely for his exquisite work on the mound through the 2019 season. This contract is one of those “worth every penny" deals thus far. The 28-year-old known as “King" Felix led the AL with <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hernafe02.shtml" target="_blank">34 starts and a 2.14 ERA</a> in 2014. He easily could have won the <a title="AL Cy Young Award" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/al-cy-young-award/" target="_blank">Cy Young Award</a>, but was edged by Cleveland’s <a title="Corey Kluber" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/corey-kluber/" target="_blank">Corey Kluber</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Albert Pujols, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750037" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750037 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456707410.jpg" alt="Division Series - Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim v Kansas City Royals - Game Three" width="757" height="504" /> Ed Zurga/Getty Images[/caption]

Big Albert Pujols found his power returning in 2014, when he slugged 27 HR and 37 2B for the Angels. The 35-year-old first baseman/DH will make $24 million in 2015, then his salary will increase every season until he makes <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/los-angeles-angels/albert-pujols/" target="_blank">$30 million in 2021</a>, the final year of his $240 million contract. Pujols will be 41 years old when his deal expires, so there ought to be a lot of anxiety in the <a title="Los Angeles Angels" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/los-angeles-angels/" target="_blank">Angels</a> organization over its value in the coming years. This deal may give A-Rod’s a run for its money as worst of all time.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Cliff Lee, Philadelphia Phillies (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750059" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750059 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/452996926.jpg" alt="Philadelphia Phillies v Washington Nationals" width="757" height="504" /> Jonathan Ernst/Getty Images[/caption]

With Roy Halladay, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt, and Cliff Lee under contract in 2011, the Phillies assembled <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/hotstove10/columns/story?id=5920160" target="_blank">a rotation for the ages</a> and planned on winning several World Series with these aces up their sleeve. It didn’t quite work out that way, and the team is still crippled by several huge contracts. Lee’s <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/cliff-lee/" target="_blank">$120 million over five years</a> ($25 million in 2015) is one of those deals that has started to burden Philadelphia and its much-maligned GM Ruben Amaro, Jr. In his 13th season at age 36, Lee managed just 13 starts in 2014 before departing with an elbow injury. Reports say he will be healthy for the 2015 season, when Phillies management will try to shop him on the trade market.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Ryan Howard, Philadelphia Phillies (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750096" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750096 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/492489581.jpg" alt="Philadelphia Phillies v Miami Marlins" width="757" height="505" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Speaking of awful contracts, the <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/philadelphia-phillies/ryan-howard/" target="_blank">five-year extension worth $125 million</a> given to Ryan Howard may go down as the worst in MLB history. Here’s how the deal has played out so far:
<ul>
	<li>2012: 14 HR, 56 RBIs, 99 SO, .219 BA in 71 games ($20 million)</li>
	<li>2013: 11 HR, 43 RBIs, 95 SO, 266 BA in 80 games ($20 million)</li>
	<li>2014: 23 HR, 95 RBIs, 190 SO, .223 BA in 154 games ($25 million)</li>
</ul>
Of the statistics worth noting, Howard’s 190 SO in 2014 were the most in the National League. The 35-year-old first baseman will make $25 million in both 2015 and 2016, which made GM Ruben Amaro publicly say the team would be <a href="http://www.nj.com/phillies/index.ssf/2014/12/ryan_howard_trade_rumors_ruben_amaro_jr_says_it_would_be_best_if_phillies_move_on_from_first_baseman.html" target="_blank">better off without him</a>. Good times!<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Justin Verlander, Detroit Tigers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750106" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750106 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456599736.jpg" alt="Division Series - Detroit Tigers v Baltimore Orioles - Game Two" width="757" height="504" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

If there ever a sure thing, it would seem like Tigers ace Justin Verlander was the guy. He had followed up a Cy Young/MVP season in 2011 (24-5, 2.40 ERA) by placing second in AL Cy Young voting in 2012 (17-8, 2.64 ERA). Even though he was signed through 2015 with a (bargain) five-year, $80 million deal, the Tigers decided to go ahead and lock him down with a <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/21969872/tigers-justin-verlander-agree-to-contract-extension-through-2019" target="_blank">five-year extension worth $140 million</a> before the start of the 2013 season. The deal was immediately praised as “<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/justin-verlander-s--180-million-contract-a-savvy-investment-for-tigers-203513113.html" target="_blank">a savvy investment</a>" by Yahoo Sports, which marveled at the Tigers’ astute reckoning of the game’s one pitcher “who warrants a contract like this." Here’s how it worked out in the short term:
<ul>
	<li>2013:  13-12, 3.46 ERA, 218.1 IP, 217 SO ($20 million)</li>
	<li>2014: 15-12, 4.54 ERA, 206.0 IP, 159 SO ($20 million)</li>
</ul>
Over 2015 , the 31-year-old Verlander will make <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/detroit-tigers/justin-verlander/" target="_blank">$28 million</a>, and he will earn the same salary annually through the 2019 season. Just when you thought there was a sure thing, this happened.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750150 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456809952.jpg" alt="Division Series - Los Angeles Dodgers v St Louis Cardinals - Game Four" width="757" height="497" /> Photo by Pool/Getty Images[/caption]

We’ve seen how long-term, big-money deals have worked out for teams, but we’d take the bet on <a title="Clayton Kershaw" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/clayton-kershaw/" target="_blank">Clayton Kershaw</a>, too. The Dodgers dished their southpaw ace <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers/clayton-kershaw/" target="_blank">$215 million over seven years</a>, making him the first with an average salary over $30 million. Kershaw responded with one of the all-time-great seasons in 2014, posting a 21-3 record with a 1.77 ERA. He was rewarded for his effort with both the NL Cy Young Award and the MVP. In 2015, he will earn $30 million, tops in Major League Baseball.

Why is Kershaw the one worth the money? It comes down to age. Each of the disastrous contracts on this list were given to a player at or near the age of 30. (Max Scherzer, who just signed a <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/22/details-of-max-scherzers-seven-year-210-million-contract-with-the-nationals/" target="_blank">seven-year deal worth $210 million</a>, turned 30 in July 2014.) When Kershaw’s deal expires, the lefty will be only 32. Los Angeles paid for their ace in his peak years.

		<description><![CDATA[Some of MLB's most popular players called it quits after the 2015 season. Here are 5 we'll miss in 2016 and beyond.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_886412" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-886412 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-182445148.jpg" alt="San Diego Padres v San Francisco Giants Barry Zito" width="800" height="550" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

With the <a title="2015 MLB season" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2015-mlb-season/" target="_blank">2015 MLB season</a> officially wrapped, we’re taking some time to salute some of the departing figures who announced their retirement from baseball. Among them, you will find World Series winners, symbols of Moneyball at its best, and one of the biggest wisecrackers of his generation. Here are five departing players we’ll miss on the diamond in 2016 and beyond.
<h2>1. Barry Zito</h2>
Zito might not top some Giants fans’ lists for fond farewells, but the lefty accomplished plenty in his 15-year career, including the 2002 Cy Young award and a clutch 2012 World Series win for <a title="San Francisco Giants" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/san-francisco-giants/" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> in Game Five against Detroit. That appearance must have felt especially triumphant after being left off the 2010 postseason roster by the club. Zito ended up beating Justin Verlander in Game One by tossing 5.2 innings of one-run ball, giving the Giants a lead they never relinquished in the Series.

The Giants bought out Zito at the end of 2013 in order not to exercise the option on his seven-year, $126-million deal that was criticized so often. In the end, Zito closed his career 165-143 with a 4.04 ERA. His postseason numbers were stellar: 6-3, 2.83 ERA, 1.21 WHIP. His best playoff performances came for the Giants in 2012. We join many others who’ll miss the crafty lefty who was a key figure in Oakland’s Moneyball movement.

Besides, how many big-leaguers <a href="http://www.csnbayarea.com/giants/barry-zito-content-surf-now-not-ready-retire" target="_blank">surf Maui and California</a>? Zito does, so say hi if you see him paddling out to a lineup near you. Check out <a href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/barry-zito-retirement-baseball/" target="_blank">his heartfelt retirement announcement</a> on Players Tribune as well.

[<em>Editor's note: The original article stated Zito won Game Five of the 2012 World Series. He won Game One.</em>]

<h2>2. Torii Hunter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_886434" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-886434 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-491321054.jpg" alt="Kansas City Royals v Minnesota Twins" width="800" height="497" /> Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

Did anyone bring more smiles to baseball fans than Torii Hunter? Even in his <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-torii-hunter-retires-20151105-story.html" target="_blank">retirement announcement</a>, he was the same joyful figure who could be seen robbing home runs and delivering snappy quotes after the game. A nine-time Gold Glove winner in the outfield, there was no one better at tracking down line drives than Hunter in his prime. He appeared in five All-Star Games and ended with a .277 average, 2,452 hits, and 353 home runs across 19 years in the game.

Hunter was a driving force behind then Twins teams that made four playoff appearances in five years in the early 2000s. (He finished sixth in MVP voting in 2002.) Though he never made it past the ALCS with the Twins, Angels, or Tigers, Hunter hit .274 with 20 RBI in 48 postseason games.

However, throw the impressive numbers and endless list of awards out the window for a minute. Torii Hunter was one of the funniest players of his (or any) generation, and his brilliant smile and constant wisecracks will be sorely missed.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Aramis Ramirez</h2>
[caption id="attachment_886499" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-886499 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-104426218.jpg" alt="St. Louis Cardinals v Chicago Cubs" width="800" height="532" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Across 18 years with the Pirates, <a title="Chicago Cubs" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/chicago-cubs/" target="_blank">Cubs</a>, and Brewers, Ramirez was a terror for NL Central pitching wearing any uniform. On top of a 2010 Silver Slugger award, he appeared in three All-Star Games and finished in the top 20 in MVP voting five times. He finished with a .283 average, 386 HR, and 2,303 hits in 2,194 games.

Ramirez will be best remembered for his peak years playing for Chicago, where he slammed 38 HR and notched 119 RBI in 2006. A native of the Dominican Republic, Ramirez actually <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14061454/aramis-ramirez-retires-18-seasons-major-league-baseball" target="_blank">told ESPN</a> he wants to go play for the Tigres de Licey in the D.R. Winter League this year. He may have retired from Major League Baseball, but he’s far from done in the game.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Tim Hudson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_886528" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-886528 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-491192206.jpg" alt="Colorado Rockies v San Francisco Giants" width="800" height="518" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Speaking of <a title="Moneyball" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/moneyball/" target="_blank">Moneyball</a>, Hudson was one of the reasons Billy Beane was able to launch his successful teams on a shoestring budget. Between Mark Mulder, Zito, and Hudson, the Oakland pitching under team control in the early 2000s could tangle with any club. Hudson ended up pitching for 17 years for the A’s, Braves, and Giants, compiling spectacular numbers along the way.

We’ll start with his 222-133 record (a .625 winning percentage, 59th all-time) and 3.49 ERA. Going back, Hudson finished fifth in Rookie of the Year voting in 1999 and second in Cy Young voting in 2000 with an AL-best 20 wins. Though he did not have a great World Series, he was instrumental in the Giants championship run of 2014.

Like some of the other members of this year’s retiring class, Hudson projected humility, grace, and class on the field. His presence will be missed by fans of his team and the opposition alike.

[<em>Editor's note: The original article incorrectly stated Hudson was Rookie of the Year in 1999. He finished fifth in voting that year.</em>]

<h2>5. Jeremy Affeldt</h2>
[caption id="attachment_886534" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-886534 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GettyImages-491322972.jpg" alt="Colorado Rockies v San Francisco Giants" width="800" height="515" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Speaking of key cogs in the three San Francisco <a title="World Series" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/world-series/" target="_blank">World Series</a> of recent years, you can’t forget Jeremy Affeldt, the southpaw who spent most of his 14-year career as a reliever. From 2009 to 2015, Affeldt was the guy Bruce Bochy called on to get the tough outs in late innings out of the bullpen. He ended up 43-46 with a 3.97 ERA in 774 games.

However, the regular season stats are largely irrelevant when considering Affeldt. His 0.86 ERA in 33 postseason appearances gets to the heart of the matter. In fact, Affeldt did not allow a single run in 21 postseason games (22.0 IP) for San Francisco across the 2012 and 2014 playoffs. We’re guessing Giants fans will recall those clutch performances whenever they think of the tall lefty who called it quits after the 2015 season. That’s <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Jeremy-Affeldt-retirement-ceremony-6549626.php" target="_blank">how Bochy thought of Affeldt</a> when saying goodbye.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_475066" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ortiz-Triple-AAA-stint-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-475066" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ortiz-Triple-AAA-stint-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ortiz-Triple-AAA-stint-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="523" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Pitchers don’t like being shown up at home plate. Over the course of Major League Baseball history, batters would often find a pitch buzzing past their heads if a pitcher thought he took his time watching a home run leave the park. In other instances, a <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v17526209/must-c-confrontation-guillen-taunts-weaver-tossed" target="_blank">confrontation might erupt</a> before the batter even makes it around the bases. The game’s best hitters fail about 70 percent of the time, so pitchers certainly have a point.

Baseball’s unwritten rules have been revised in recent years. Because of the high value of contracts and stern directives from MLB headquarters, players risk long suspensions and public chastising for risking their safety while making tens of millions of dollars. Hot-dogging has also become more commonplace in general in this “gentleman’s game.”

Take the home run trot, for example. The sort of slow jog around the bases that used to clear benches barely gets a few bats of the eye in today’s game. Judging by the <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/category/tater-trot-tracker" target="_blank">Wezen-Ball Tater Trot Tracker</a> — a brilliant service that times home run (or “tater”) trot times —  it’s getting worse. Here are the six slowest home run trots in recorded history, or what metric creator Larry Granillo describes as the “Tater Trot Tracker era.”

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">6. Hanley Ramirez (30.3 seconds)</strong></h2>
<iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=22751355&amp;topic_id=6479266&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb"></iframe>

The date was July 1, 2012. At the plate was Hanley Ramirez, then a member of the Florida Marlins. Han-Ram connected on a curveball from Philly’s Antonio Bastardo and sent it flying over the left-field fence. Ramirez’s shot amounted to little more than insurance runs for the Marlins, but the extended home run trot was <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/tater-trot-tracker-tater-trot-tracker/2012-tater-trot-tracker-leaders.html" target="_blank">the second longest of 2012</a>, according to Tater Trot Tracker.

Clocking in at 30.3 seconds, Ramirez puts on a textbook display of how to make a home run trot last long. He starts with a prolonged hold of the bat while watching the ball take flight before breaking into a very slow jog around the horn. To put himself in the running for the all-time record, Hanley actually stops jogging and walks the last few steps before touching home plate.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. David Ortiz (30.59 seconds)</h2>
<iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=8316537&amp;topic_id=6479266&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb"></iframe>

Pitchers are quite familiar with the home run protocol of David Ortiz. Known for both his extended watching of well-struck balls as well as general slowness in rounding the bases, Ortiz is a perennial leader on the Tater Trot Tracker board. Even for him, Ortiz’s performance in 2013 was over-the-top: the Tater Trot Tracker clocked the Red Sox DH with seven of <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/tater-trot-tracker-tater-trot-tracker/2013-tater-trot-tracker-leaders.html" target="_blank">the year’s 10 slowest trots</a>.

This 30.59-second trot from May 25, 2010, put Ortiz in elite company. For starters, it was the first time a non-injured player had broken the mark of 30 seconds in the era of recorded times. It was also a Tater Trot record that held for nearly three full seasons. More on that later.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">4. Miguel Cabrera (30.94 seconds)</strong></h2>


On the night of August 23, 2013, Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera unloaded on a pitch from the Mets’ Daisuke Matsuzaka at Citi Field. The path of the ball headed toward the left-field foul pole, causing Miggy to watch while he began his slow home run trot.

By the time it had ended, he had spent 30.94 seconds on the base paths for one of the longest trots in recorded history, though it was only second on the list of 2013′s <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/tater-trot-tracker-tater-trot-tracker/trot-times-for-the-weekend-of-august-25-2013.html" target="_blank">most time-consuming trots</a>. In defense of Cabrera’s trot, the slugger was suffering from injuries that forced him to jog at a slow pace, even on balls in play. Cabrera doesn’t top many MLB showboat lists. He doesn’t have to — at his elite level, his gaudy stats speak for themselves.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">3. Todd Helton (31.54 seconds)</strong></h2>
<iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=27176385&amp;topic_id=6479266&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb"></iframe>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em">The Colorado Rockies legend takes third place here, which marks Helton as the only U.S.-born player on the list. After driving a Matt Cain pitch toward the right-field foul pole on </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">May 16, 2013</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">, it took Helton 31.54 seconds to round the bases and cross home plate. Tate Trot Tracker celebrated the occasion by <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/tater-trot-tracker-tater-trot-tracker/welcome-to-the-30-second-club-todd-helton.html" target="_blank">welcoming Helton to the 30-second club</a>. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em">In all fairness, the hit joined a few others on the list as a shot that could have gone foul. Helton was also slowed by nagging injuries that forced him to run at a snail’s pace. Notably, he keeps his head down as a symbol of respect until he crosses home plate. Since he wasn’t placed on the disabled list for an injury suffered during or after the home run swing, he’s forced to land at third place for longest trot in the era of tracking.<!--nextpage--></span>
<h2>2. Bobby Abreu (31.56 seconds)</h2>
<iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=25174925&amp;topic_id=6479266&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb"></iframe>

On September 29, 2012, at Dodger Stadium, Bobby Abreu had a pitch buzz past him, nearly drilling the veteran hitter in what appeared to be his last hurrah in the Major Leagues. Abreu cracked a pitch later in an at-bat that headed toward the right-field foul pole. Was it the last home run Abreu would ever hit? Considering the fact he didn’t play in 2013 and was cut by the Phillies in 2014 Spring Training, it may very well have been Abreu’s last tater.

“Bobby’s gonna enjoy the ride,” Vin Scully noted sweetly as Abreu trotted around the bases. At a recorded time of 31.56 seconds, it represented a record that stood for the entire 2013 season among players not injured on the swing.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. David Ortiz (32.94 seconds)</h2>
<iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=31954343&amp;topic_id=6479266&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb"></iframe>

Then there was the home run trot slow enough that it seemed like it went ’round the world. Ortiz claimed the <a href="http://wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/david-ortiz-sets-the-record-for-slowest-tater-trot.html" target="_blank">all-time Tater Trot record </a>on April 9, 2014, with a shot that cleared Fenway’s Pesky Pole for a go-ahead home run. When it was all said and done, Ortiz not only broke 32 seconds but came close to reaching the once-farcical mark of 33 seconds in setting this record.

It’s unsurprising to find Ortiz claiming two of top six spots in the list of longest recorded home run trots. In 2013, he held seven of the top 10 spots, according to the Tater Trot Tracker. Pitchers certainly notice the designated hitter’s snail pace around the bases. <span style="line-height: 1.5em">During the 2013 MLB playoffs, Rays ace David Price <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2013/10/david_price_says_ortiz_was_slow_out_of_the_box.html" target="_blank">called out Ortiz</a> for his slow trot following an ALDS home run: </span>“[Ortiz] stares at it to see if it’s fair or foul, I’m sure that’s what he would say, but as soon as he hit it and I saw it I knew it was fair. Run.”

Though Price was criticized by the media and later apologized for his comments, there were probably dozens of pitchers screaming “Amen!” from their respective locations around the world. In a game where Bob Gibson used to throw at batters for taking too big a swing, it seems pitchers have lost their right to remind hitters of the rules, let alone enforce them.

Who will be the first hitter to break 33 seconds on a home run trot? A betting man might wager it will happen in 2015.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_549912" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-549912" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-481342962-640x411.jpg" alt="Bryce Harper reacts to striking out." width="757" height="486" /> Bryce Harper and the Nats are still searching for that elusive title. | Mitchell Layton/Getty Images[/caption]

Much was made of the Kansas City Royals’ long postseason drought as KC made it to the playoffs -- in 2014 -- for the first time since 1985. This franchise clearly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-longest-losing-streaks-in-sports-history.html/">knew how to lose</a>. And yet, at least the Royals <em>won</em> the Series in 1985. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for every organization in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/mlb/">Major League Baseball</a>.

For eight different MLB clubs -- more than a quarter of the league -- World Series glory has been nothing but a pipe dream. To put that into perspective, even the Cubs managed to recently <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-biggest-blunders-2016-world-series.html/">overcome a miserable 108-year curse</a>. These eight franchises, well, they'd give anything for that sort of luck.

With that, here's a look at each of the eight MLB ball clubs that have never won it all, in order from newest team to oldest. Which one will finally break through first, and how many more years will it take?

<h2>1. Tampa Bay Rays</h2>
[caption id="attachment_656100" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-656100" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Tim-Beckham-Tampa-Bay-Rays-640x409.jpg" alt="Tim Beckham of the Tampa Bay Rays slides in safely with a triple." width="757" height="484" /> The Rays consistently fall face-first. | Mike Carlson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Rays can almost be forgiven for not earning a championship yet, since the team <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TBD/">didn’t begin play until 1998</a>. The franchise didn’t make the postseason once in its first decade of existence, but since changing its name from Devil Rays to Rays, the team has qualified for the playoffs four times in nine years. (Coincidence? You be the judge.) The highlight of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/sports-teams-that-need-to-relocate.html/">Rays’ existence</a> to date was a 2008 trip to the World Series. Sadly, Tampa Bay fell short, losing in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Colorado Rockies</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Mark-Reynolds-Colorado-Rockies.jpg" alt="Mark Reynolds of the Colorado Rockies heads back to the dugout after striking out." width="757" height="517" /> Another strike out for the Rockies. | Dylan Buell/Getty Images[/caption]

The Colorado Rockies are also one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-ways-for-the-colorado-rockies-to-contend-in-2017.html/">newer additions</a> to Major League Baseball, joining the league in 1993. However, they’ll always be compared to the Marlins, who started play in the same year and have two rings to show for their troubles. Colorado has only made the playoffs three times in 24 seasons, most notably winning the National League pennant in 2007. The Rockies’ success ended abruptly there, though, as Boston made quick work of them <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/12-mlb-teams-that-made-the-world-series-as-a-wild-card.html/">in a World Series sweep</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Seattle Mariners</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679463" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679463" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-537776326-640x401.jpg" alt="Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners walks off the field." width="757" height="474" /> It's not easy being a Mariner. | Stephen Brashear/Getty Images[/caption]

The Seattle Mariners began play in 1977 and have, by and large, been underwhelming in their 40 seasons of existence. Seattle has only made the playoffs four times in that span, and is still looking for the first World Series appearance in franchise history. The Ms <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/teams-won-100-games-no-world-series.html/">won a whopping 116 games</a> in 2001, tying an MLB record. However, Ichiro Suzuki, Bret Boone, and company couldn’t get past the Yankees in the ALCS, bowing out in five games. The Mariners haven’t returned to the postseason since.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Washington Nationals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_701145" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-701145 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-527696382.jpg" alt="yan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals in action." width="757" height="505" /> The Nationals are super frustrating. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Besides Seattle, only one other franchise has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-3-cities-that-could-use-a-world-series-title.html/">never even made the World Series</a>, and it’s the Washington Nationals. The team, which began as the Montreal Expos in 1969, struggled mightily from the outset, only qualifying for the playoffs once in 36 years during its time in Canada. Since moving to Washington, D.C. in 2005, the Nats have been slightly more respectable, making it to the postseason three times in the last five years (2012–16). Of course, not only have they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-world-series-droughts-cubs-indians.html/">failed to win the big one</a>, but they haven't even managed to advance past the Division Series.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. San Diego Padres</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642288" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wil-Myers-San-Diego-Padres-640x440.jpg" alt="Wil Myers of the San Diego Padres walks back to the dugout after striking out." width="757" height="520" /> The Padres need help. | Dylan Buell/Getty Images[/caption]

The Padres have won the pennant twice in five postseason appearances since starting play in 1969, advancing to the World Series both in 1984 and 1998. The Tigers beat the ’84 Padres team in five games, and the Yankees swept the ’98 club out of the playoffs. That means <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-best-ballparks-watch-game.html/">San Diego</a> is still looking for world championship No. 1 <span class="s1">-- </span>and it doesn’t look like it’s coming anytime soon. The Padres haven't been to the playoffs since 2006.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Milwaukee Brewers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671858" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671858" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Chris-Carter-Milwaukee-Brewers-640x426.jpg" alt="Chris Carter of the Milwaukee Brewers swings at a pitch." width="757" height="504" /> Swing and a miss for the Brewers. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

The Milwaukee Brewers <span class="s1">-- </span>or Seattle Pilots, as they were known in the team’s 1969 inaugural season <span class="s1">-- </span>have played in both the American League and National League, but still haven’t won a World Series. The highlight of Milwaukee’s four trips to the playoffs was in 1982, when the Brewers represented the AL in the Fall Classic. The St. Louis Cardinals edged Milwaukee in seven games to keep the Brew Crew title-less. The Brewers played 25 more seasons before even getting a sniff of the playoffs again (in 2008).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Houston Astros</h2>
[caption id="attachment_694416" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-694416 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-526025918.jpg" alt="Colby Rasmus of the Houston Astros walks off the field." width="757" height="507" /> The Astros can't get over the hump. | Stephen Brashear/Getty Images[/caption]

The Houston Astros, which came into existence as the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, have made the World Series just one time in 55 years. That happened in 2005, when a rotation of Roy Oswalt, Andy Pettitte, and Roger Clemens lifted the ‘Stros to the National League pennant, capping off a run of six playoff appearances in nine years. Ultimately, the Astros couldn’t get past the White Sox that season (or even win a single game in the World Series). Houston fans will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-weaknesses-houston-astros-must-fix-to-contend-2017.html/">hope for better things</a> in the future now that the team has found a new home in the American League.

<h2>8. Texas Rangers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_698157" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-698157" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-600178606-640x355.jpg" alt="Adrian Beltre of the Texas Rangers falls down." width="757" height="420" /> The Texas Rangers consistently fall short. | Brandon Wade/Getty Images[/caption]

The oldest MLB ball club to never win a championship is the Texas Rangers. The Rangers, who began play in 1961 as the then-Washington Senators, just completed their 56th season of ring-less existence. The club went 35 years without making the playoffs at all, but they've been to the postseason eight times since 1996. That includes two consecutive American League pennants, as the Rangers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/texas-rangers-win-2017-world-series.html/">made it to the World Series</a> both in 2010 and 2011. The second of those trips is by far the most painful, since Texas came within a single strike of eliminating the Cardinals in six games but couldn’t close the deal.

It’s no longer <a title="10 of the Most Unforgettable Moments in Derek Jeter’s Career" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/10-of-the-most-unforgettable-moments-in-derek-jeters-career.html/" target="_blank">Derek Jeter’s</a> world, one where other ballplayers just live. With No. 2 retired from the game and a crop of fresh-faced superstars dominating <a title="10 Most Unbreakable Records in Major League Baseball History" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/10-most-unbreakable-records-in-major-league-baseball-history.html/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> in 2015, jersey sales are skewing toward the young and mighty, according to the sales stats posted on MLB.com.

With the departure of Jeter, the shortstop position and the Yankees as a whole departed from the top 20 jerseys based on sales from Opening Day through the All-Star Game. As is to be expected the (soon to be former) World Series Champion <a title="San Francisco Giants" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/san-francisco-giants/" target="_blank">San Francisco Giants</a> continue to appeal to fans looking to don a player’s replica uniform.

Here are the 10 best-selling jerseys of MLB players in 2015.
<h2>10. Anthony Rizzo, Cubs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828284" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828284 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-479812648.jpg" alt="St Louis Cardinals v Chicago Cubs - Game One" width="800" height="501" /> Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

With the signing of Jon Lester, the arrival of manager Joe Maddon, and the promotion of <a title="5 Reasons why Kris Bryant is the Real Deal" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/5-reasons-why-kris-bryant-is-the-real-deal.html/" target="_blank">Kris Bryant</a>, we have entered a new era of Chicago Cubs baseball. First baseman Anthony Rizzo is the anchor of the lineup with his 16 HR, 25 2B, .287 average and .916 OPS. He’s the only first baseman in the top 10 and one of two North Siders to make it into the top 20 of jersey sales for 2015. With Rizzo’s power and overall offensive game, we expect to see him here for years to come.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. David Ortiz, Red Sox</h2>

While he had a slow start to the 2015 season, Boston’s <a title="David Ortiz" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/david-ortiz/" target="_blank">David Ortiz</a> continues to be the face of the organization along with Dustin Pedroia (who just missed this list at No. 11). Ortiz has hit 7 HR over his last 30 games, boosting his homer count to respectability despite career lows in batting average (.231), on-base percentage (.322), and slugging (.430). In what’s becoming <a title="MLB: 7 Reasons the Red Sox Are Falling Apart This Season" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-7-reasons-the-red-sox-are-falling-apart-this-season.html/" target="_blank">a lost season for the Red Sox</a>, Ortiz’s hold on jersey buyers remains undiminished.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Matt Harvey, Mets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828309" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828309 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-477363548.jpg" alt="Toronto Blue Jays v New York Mets" width="800" height="492" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

<a title="MLB: Is Matt Harvey or Jacob deGrom Best of the Mets?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-is-matt-harvey-or-jacob-degrom-best-of-the-mets.html/" target="_blank">Jacob deGrom</a> might be the best Mets pitcher in 2015, but <a title="MLB: Is Matt Harvey’s Honeymoon With Mets Fans Over?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-is-matt-harveys-honeymoon-with-mets-fans-over.html/" target="_blank">Matt Harvey</a> is still the rock star and most talked about figure suiting up in Flushing. No. 33’s season stats may not be as eye-popping as his breakout campaign of 2013, but Harvey’s eight wins and a 3.19 ERA will do. As he continues to settle in following his <a title="MLB: 5 Reasons Matt Harvey’s Comeback Has Been a Bumpy Ride" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-5-reasons-matt-harveys-comeback-has-been-a-bumpy-ride.html/" target="_blank">comeback from Tommy John surgery</a> and rehab, expect Harvey’s star to continue rising. He’s certainly no stranger to publicity.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Mike Trout, Angels</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828333" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828333 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-481164156.jpg" alt="Boston Red Sox v Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim" width="800" height="508" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Considered by many to be the heir apparent to Derek Jeter as the face of MLB, <a title="MLB: Is Nolan Arenado On the Same Level as Mike Trout or Bryce Harper?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-is-nolan-arenado-on-the-same-level-as-mike-trout-or-bryce-harper.html/" target="_blank">Mike Trout</a> is somehow not cracking the top five in jersey sales this season. The Millville Meteor is likely to get a bump following his All-Star Game MVP turn and continued dominance of the league, but for now he’ll have to settle for seventh place on the 2015 list. His show-stopping walkoff versus the Red Sox and red-hot Angels run are a few reasons we expect Trout sales to spike.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Hunter Pence, Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828339" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828339 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-479840468.jpg" alt="New York Mets v San Francisco Giants" width="800" height="513" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Giants home uniform might top the list of best-looking MLB jerseys, and Hunter Pence’s No. 8 looks awfully good in black with orange trim on the eggshell-white background. Bonus points on this model for the classic, no-name style of San Francisco’s home jersey. Of course, Pence’s place on the list comes from the right fielder’s contributions to the 2012 and 2014 World Series teams. Pence also has <a href="http://m.mlb.com/cutfour/2014/08/06/88251502/photos-the-11-best-hunter-pence-troll-signs-ranked" target="_blank">a wacky sense of humor</a> and eccentric approach at the plate and in the batter’s box, adding to his fan-favorite status. (Our favorite troll of No. 8: “Hunter Pence whispers ‘sorry’ when he catches a fly ball.")

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Bryce Harper, Nationals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828388" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828388 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-481342962.jpg" alt="Los Angeles Dodgers v Washington Nationals" width="800" height="514" /> Mitchell Layton/Getty Images[/caption]

There is no MLB player getting on base and slugging like Bryce Harper in 2015, as his world-leading 1.152 OPS would attest. Harper is hitting .333 with 27 HR and 21 2B this magical season. He’s getting on base nearly once every two plate appearances and he has a shot at walking (70 BB) more than he strikes out (76 SO) by year’s end. You can’t count him out for any milestone if this run keeps up, including the Triple Crown. Expect his jersey to continue flying out of stores.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828374" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828374 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-481256504.jpg" alt="Los Angeles Dodgers v Washington Nationals" width="800" height="497" /> Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

Clayton Kershaw wasn’t originally selected to the NL All-Star team, but the southpaw rightfully ended up on the squad in Cincinnati for his fifth straight Midsummer Classic appearance. In his last two starts, Kershaw has been his old, impossibly dominant self with 0 ER, 27 SO, and 0 BB over 17 IP (both wins, one a complete-game shutout). After an uneven start to 2015, Kershaw looks ready to reprise his epic 2014 campaign, when he won both the Cy Young Award and National League MVP. Expect No. 22 to remain a hot jersey at concessions stands.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Buster Posey, Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828395" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828395 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-479062266.jpg" alt="Colorado Rockies v San Francisco Giants" width="800" height="491" /> Don Feria/Getty Images[/caption]

It might not have the same amount of white space as the Pence No. 8, but Buster Posey’s home jersey is another bit of sartorial splendor. Posey, the rock on which three Giants World Series Championships were built, remains one of the game’s most popular players as he has another productive campaign (.318 BA, 66 RBI) for San Francisco. He’s also one of the few players currently walking (36 BB) more than he strikes out (32 SO).<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kris Bryant, Cubs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828400" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828400 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-476907382.jpg" alt="David Banks/Getty Images" width="800" height="502" /> David Banks/Getty Images[/caption]

<a title="Kris Bryant" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kris-bryant/" target="_blank">Kris Bryant</a> took the baseball world by storm with his epic performance in Spring Training, and after his April callup the Cubs rookie has not disappointed (12 HR, 54 RBI, .816 OPS). Fans buying Bryant jerseys know they have a player who will be wearing that uni for years ahead as he stays under Chicago club control. With the Cubs leading the race for the second NL Wild Card, Bryant might also find himself in the postseason his first year in The Show.<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 1. Madison Bumgarner, Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_828406" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-828406 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-478916856.jpg" alt="Madison Bumgarner" width="800" height="513" /> Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

In a showcase of baseball’s best, Madison Bumgarner looked like he was playing on another level as he dismantled the Royals and won the 2014 <a title="Madison Bumgarner: Greatest Pitcher in World Series History?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/madison-bumgarner-greatest-pitcher-in-world-series-history.html/" target="_blank">World Series MVP</a>. That performance, along with another strong showing in 2015 (10 W, 3.19 ERA, 124 SO, 24 BB), has kept the Giants ace leading the pack in jersey sales. Everyone wants to rock MadBum’s No. 40 and, as with the other Giants jerseys, we recommend it in the San Francisco home white.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_851546" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-851546" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4924843591-e1400685640484.jpg" alt="Jared Wickersham/Getty Images" width="757" height="426" /> Jared Wickersham/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>There&#8217;s oftentimes little use in trying to make even analogous comparisons between the lives of athletes and the world the rest of us live in. There are few functional metaphors that can be found to relate anything we do to any aspect of their work, or personal, lives.</p>
<p>Baseball, for its part, comes the closest – they even call their starting position players &#8220;everyday players," because for the better part of six months (and seven if a team makes the playoffs), those players can expect to show up to the ballpark just about every single day having a game to play. If there&#8217;s one type of athlete who – in addition to having the good sense and tact to not tell you how much harder than you they work – can relate to your daily and weekly grind, it&#8217;s a baseball player.</p>
<p>Just as we have regular functions we&#8217;re supposed to execute – we type, for instance – everyday players on the baseball diamond are out there with the general expectation that they&#8217;ll field at least adequately and, more importantly, will hit well enough to justify their spot in the lineup. Doing a decent enough job to record a solid overall batting average is commendable, but there&#8217;s something extra special about guys who can go on elongated hitting streaks, getting on base via at least one hit, day in and day out.</p>
<p>Thus far in 2015, four hitters have reached the 20 game mark for such a streak. Although, crucially, it should be mentioned that not a single one has made it even halfway to Joe DiMaggio&#8217;s historic 56 game mark, it&#8217;s still nothing to sniff at. So, without further ado, let&#8217;s take a look at the guys who have gone on the longest streaks at the plate this season.<br />
<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Jason Kipnis (20 games from June 3 through 26)</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_851548" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-851548" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/452407244.jpg" alt="Duane Burleson/Getty Images" width="757" height="426" /> Duane Burleson/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Indians&#8217; second baseman was a one-time leader in the race for the American League batting title, overlapping with the rise of Cleveland in the chase for the second Wild Card spot. Incidentally, the two slipped a bit at roughly the same time. Nonetheless, however, the future appears bright in Cleveland &#8212; and a big reason why is young, talented fixtures like Kipnis.</p>
<h2>3. Nelson Cruz (21 games from July 21 through August 11)</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re fairly certain that Cruz would trade this hitting streak to be back in Baltimore – albeit making less money – and possibly competing for a Wild Card spot. While the Orioles are as sad as they&#8217;ve been since 2011, it goes without saying that the departure of their 40 home run man from last season did them no favors. As for Cruz and his new team, the Mariners, they went just 11-10 during this particular stretch and find themselves in <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings" target="_blank">a position</a> of the standings that&#8217;s been familiar for them over the past decade.<br />
<!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Troy Tulowitzki (21 games from June 15 through July 9)</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_851547" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-851547" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CITY-BASE-superJumbo.jpg" alt="Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Accomplished while still a member of the Colorado Rockies, this streak was a solid run for one of the game&#8217;s best shortstops who, up until his trade to Toronto, was having one of the best seasons of his career. In a second half where just about everything else they&#8217;ve touched has turned to gold, Tulowitzki has barely registered as an above replacement-level player. For Jays fans, here&#8217;s hoping he can rediscover the form he found in the early summer for what now seems to be an inevitable postseason run.</p>
<h2>1. Edwin Encarnacion (26 games from July 26 through August 31)</h2>
<p>Other Blue Jays hitters have understandably received quite a bit of attention from baseball writers and the media, but one thing that neither Jose Bautista nor Josh Donaldson can match is the just recently concluded streak that their teammate Edwin Encarnacion went on. Perhaps the most impressive, if random, aspect of the power-hitting designated hitter&#8217;s streak? He&#8217;s a career .265 hitter who&#8217;s sporting a .267 average this season as well.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Horrified by Deflategate? Here are the tales of 7 MLB pitchers that make such the NFL's tales of cheating seem amateur.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_802684" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802684 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/452892468.jpg" alt="2014 Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony" width="757" height="489" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

All around the world, <a title="How Should the NFL Punish Tom Brady and the Patriots?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/how-should-the-nfl-punish-tom-brady-and-the-patriots.html/" target="_blank">NFL fans are debating</a> whether the Patriots intentionally underinflated footballs in hopes of gaining a competitive edge. In about as many places on planet earth, former and current Major League Baseball pitchers are chuckling to themselves as they think about how they’ve defaced the ball to gain an advantage over the years — some of them en route to <a title="Good, Bad, and Ugly Calls By the MLB Hall of Fame Committees" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/good-bad-and-ugly-calls-by-the-mlb-hall-of-fame-committees.html/" target="_blank">Hall of Fame</a> careers.

The difference is how proud the pitchers are of their expertise in doctoring the baseball and (often) how good they were at getting away with their trickery. (Anyone who questions that fact can refer to Gaylord Perry’s “autobiographical confession" titled, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Spitter-An-Autobiographical-Confession/dp/0841502994" target="_blank">Me and the Spitter</a>.)</em>

They loved being the masters of deception, and getting the batter to think a spitball was coming was almost as good as throwing one. But lubing up a baseball with Vaseline and other less wholesome fluids really just scratches the surface, so to speak. Tales of filing, scuffing, and otherwise doctoring balls are as old as the game itself. (In fact, spitballs were legal in baseball until the 1920 season, after which <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Spitball" target="_blank">17 spitball specialists</a> were grandfathered in and allowed to continue with the trick pitch.)

Anyhow, as the NFL circus surrounding Deflategate continues, we take a look back at the most brazen, the craftiest, the best and worst cheaters in the history of Major League pitchers. Here are seven tricksters who make modern ball doctoring seem like child’s play. They are ranked in no particular order.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Joe Niekro</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzxrKO-yVV8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

“What did they find in [Niekro’s] pocket?" announcers asked. Well, that was an emery board the Twins right-hander casually tossed to the side while being stripsearched on the mound. They also retrieved some sandpaper. Unfortunately for Niekro, an umpire caught one of the flying objects on the way out of his pocket and ejected him. Major League Baseball suspended him 10 games for the incident, but it was nearing the end of Niekro’s 22-year career in which he won 221 games for seven different teams.

It’s hard to say which is funnier — the look of persecution on Niekro’s face during the search or the argument after he’s caught. Either way, there is clearly no shame involved. Umpire Dave Phillips’s <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-08-28/sports/8703050510_1_emery-board-joe-niekro-umpires" target="_blank">comments after the game</a> reveal how prevalent trickery was at the time (1987).

“[T]ampering with baseballs has become so blatant, so abusive," Phillips told The Chicago Tribune after the incident. “You’ll be watching a guy pitching in a normal way, and all of a sudden his fastball moves in — how should we say? — an extraordinary way." For his part, Niekro got a real kick out the affair and appeared on “Late Night With David Letterman" a few days later operating a power sander. No, he did not apologize and go directly to rehab.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Kevin Gross</h2>
[caption id="attachment_802717" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802717 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2435443.jpg" alt="Kevin Gross winds back to pitch" width="757" height="461" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

When Joe Niekro was busted for his paraphernalia in 1987, it marked the first time a pitcher had been suspended since the great Gaylord Perry in 1982 (more on His Eminence later). Then Kevin Gross of the <a title="Phillies" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/phillies/" target="_blank">Phillies</a> was nabbed just a week following the Niekro incident. In this case, Gross had pasted a piece of sandpaper to his glove for the game against the Cubs and was casually scuffing pitches when he deemed the situation worthy.

According to a contemporary report in the L.A. Times, Cubs manager Gene Michael <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-11/sports/sp-881_1_umpires" target="_blank">suspected Gross was doctoring the ball</a> on numerous occasions during the season and had waited for the appropriate moment to demand the umpires check him. It came when Andre Dawson stepped to the plate. “I thought he’d have one scuffed for Andre," Michael said.

Gross had been struggling in the 1987 season, which proved to be his worst to date in what became a 15-year MLB career. He was suspended 10 games and had his glove confiscated. Gross’s final season was 1997, when he finished with a 142-158 record (4.11 ERA). Examples like this one are useful to remind baseball fans it’s not always <a title="Barry Bonds" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/barry-bonds/" target="_blank">Barry Bonds</a> doing the cheating. What about the average struggling pitcher looking for a lift? What about the ones who were never caught?

<h2>3. Whitey Ford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_802739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802739" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/96268599.jpg" alt="Vincent Laforet/Getty Images" width="757" height="498" /> Vincent Laforet/Getty Images[/caption]

“The Chairman of the Board" bore a nickname previously reserved for Sinatra and led the Mantle-era Yankees to nine World Series titles, amassing a winning percentage of .690 (236-106), best of any 20th century pitcher.  Ford was also a master trickster both on and off the mound. Stories from Jim Bouton’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ball-Four-RosettaBooks-Sports-Classics-ebook/dp/B00CME4ROM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432054917&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ball+four" target="_blank">Ball Four</a> </em>broach the subject from many angles, including Ford’s advice to Bouton to “get a tan" before leaving Florida if he wanted to convince management he was in shape after Spring Training.

Bouton also told of Whitey’s elaborate scuffing procedures, which involved battery mate Elston Howard scraping the ball on the ground before throwing it back to the mound. In a book titled, “Slick," Ford told of even more schemes he would use to trick hitters, including the formulation of “mud balls" and having a ring custom-made especially for doctoring the baseball.

Ironically, the book was released in the summer of 1987, just before Gross and Niekro were busted for their respective schemes. In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/21/sports/scouting-ford-defends-doctoring.html" target="_blank">an article in the New York Times</a> upon his book’s publication, Ford defended doctoring the baseball because of the high salaries pitchers stood to earn, which were about 10 times that of Ford’s in his day.

“If the money had been as good in those days as it is now, I’d have pitched into my 40s like a lot of players are doing today," Ford told the Times. “And I would have used whatever help I needed to get batters out."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Gaylord Perry</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/64AkdlETbgo" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

If there were one towering figure in the game’s past — a Babe Ruth of MLB cheaters — it would have to be Gaylord Perry, a pitcher who posted 314 wins and ended his ride in the MLB Hall of Fame. Perry’s <em>Me and the Spitter</em> may still be the definitive work in the confessional trickster genre, and there is little reason to believe any stories are false.

“I reckon I tried everything on the old apple but salt and pepper and chocolate sauce topping," he said.  Vaseline was Perry’s preferred lube, but he was by no means limited to this substance. Manager Gene Mauch once said Perry should have a tube of KY Jelly attached to his plaque in Cooperstown. <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/quoperry.shtml" target="_blank">Baseball Almanac</a> quotes a few treasures from Perry’s life with the spitball that sum things up nicely.

“I’d always have it (grease) in at least two places in case the umpires would ask me to wipe one off," Perry wrote. “I never wanted to be caught out there with anything, though. It wouldn’t be professional."

“Greaseball, greaseball, greaseball, that’s all I throw [Rod Carew], and he still hits them. He’s the only player in baseball who consistently hits my grease. He sees the ball so well, I guess he can pick out the dry side."

Perry was only caught and suspended once for doctoring the ball in his 22-year career. It was his second-to-last season in the Majors, and the punishment lasted 10 games. With everyone aware Perry could throw the spitball at any moment, he wielded the threat as successfully as the pitch, and made sure to run his finger across his brow before every pitch. Was it coming? Hitters never knew.<!--nextpage-->.
<h2>5. Preacher Roe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_802776" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802776 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/51663826.jpg" alt="Dodgers' Preacher Roe" width="757" height="494" /> Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

Gaylord Perry was in many ways the spiritual heir to Preacher Roe, the Brooklyn Dodgers star who led the “Bums" to three pennants, including a 22-3 campaign in 1951. Roe became known as both a master spitballer and a master of deception, deploying the fake spitball to great success the way Perry did later.

He also matched Perry in pure brashness, publishing an article in Sports Illustrated titled “The Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch" just one year after his retirement. The New York Times detailed Roe’s stance on the spitter in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/sports/baseball/11roe.html" target="_blank">its 2008 obituary</a> on the late pitcher.

“It never bothered me none throwing a spitter," Roe said. “If no one is going to help the pitcher in this game, he’s got to help himself." Roger Kahn’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Summer-Harperperennial-Modern-Classics-ebook/dp/B004JN1DGY/ref=pd_sim_351_1?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1TJF2MF1KCKJ4PV9E8GZ" target="_blank">Boys of Summer</a> </em>also detailed Roe’s techniques of throwing the fake spitter.

“He’s waiting for that good hard drop," Roe told Kahn. “I touch the visor and throw a big slow curve. He was so wound up he couldn’t swing. But he spit at the ball as it went by."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Mike Scott</h2>
[caption id="attachment_802794" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802794 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/94732675.jpg" alt="Houston Astros - Mike Scott" width="757" height="488" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Upon further investigation, umpire suspicions of trickery in the 1980s appeared firmly grounded in reality. Case in point was the 1986 postseason that ended in the memorable World Series between the Mets and Red Sox. In that year’s NLCS, allegations surfaced that the Astros’ Mike Scott was scuffing the baseball against New York, but the Mets’ Keith Hernandez said the suspicions were there the entire year.

“We knew this during the season because when you’re [the] home team, every foul ball that goes up to the screen and gets rolled back down, the bat boy collects it," <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/25882718/network-recalls-1986-postseason" target="_blank">Hernandez explained to MLB Network</a>. “It doesn’t go to the visitor’s side, it goes to the home team’s side, so we knew." (As an aside, the allegations were coming from a Mets team that openly admitted using cocaine and various other drugs.) Scott didn’t exactly deny it.

“They can believe whatever they want to believe," Scott later said. “Every ball that hits the ground has something on it … I’ve thrown balls that were scuffed but I haven’t scuffed every ball that I’ve thrown." It probably was no coincidence that umpires cracked down on pitchers the following season.

<h2>7. Don Sutton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_802797" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802797 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/72317517.jpg" alt="Baseball Pitchers" width="757" height="488" /> Stephen Dunn /Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

In the cheating pitchers’ hall of fame, Don Sutton deserves a place near Gaylord Perry for his enduring success (23 years) and sparkling win total (326, 14th all time). Though accused of doctoring baseballs throughout his career, Sutton was only caught with a scuffed model once, in 1978. The league handed him a 10-game suspension but, after threats of lawsuits, curiously dropped the ban.

Accusations continued for years, so much so that Sutton began playing games with both hitters and umpires who thought they could catch him. It never happened. In 1982, Sutton told the Washington Post’s Thomas Boswell just how much fun he was having with the routine.

“I ought to get a Black &amp; Decker commercial out of it," Sutton said."The only fun I get now is hiding dirty notes in my uniform pockets for the umpires to find when they search me." After that quip, everyone began calling him “Black &amp; Decker."Suton was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1998, but still refused to (fully) admit to anything from his playing days. He came close in <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/48446770/barry-m-bloom-don-sutton-never-shy-about-voicing-his-opinion" target="_blank">an interview with MLB.com</a> that year.

The exchange went like this:
<blockquote><b>MLB.com</b>: Did you cheat?

<b>Sutton</b>: No, I never got caught cheating.</blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807122" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-474149870.jpg" alt="Rob Foldy/Getty Images " />

It’s widely accepted that hitting a baseball is the toughest job in professional sports. Those who are successful about three times out of 10 are the best in the league. Everyone else simply tries to keep up with the filthy stuff featured by so many of today’s <a title="Major League Baseball" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/major-league-baseball/" target="_blank">Major League</a> pitchers.

Over the past 15 years, the number of pitchers throwing 100 miles or better has grown to unprecedented proportions, and the numbers are getting more intimidating by the year. (For evidence, see the eight pitchers who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-mlb-pitchers-throwing-100-mph-or-faster-in-2014.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">broke 100 miles per hour</a> in 2014.) Hitters have been having a historically bad time catching up to pitchers in recent years. Now, with even more lethal arms coming out of MLB bullpens, hitters who don’t get their hits off starters early are in for a long night at the ballpark.

Here are the eight MLB pitchers who have thrown pitches clocked at 100 miles per hour or faster in 2015, listed in ascending order to the fastest thrown this season. The numbers come from Pitch f/x data, considered the most accurate system of measurement and one that often downgrades stadium radar-gun readings.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>8. Kelvin Herrera, Royals</h2>
Returning to the century club for the fourth straight year is Kelvin Herrera, the <a title="Royals" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/royals/" target="_blank">Royals</a> reliever who in 2012 uncorked a pitch clocked at 102.8 miles per hour. His velocity isn’t quite on that level in 2015, but he has tossed a four-seam fastball measured at 100.0 miles per hour this season. He holds a 2.12 ERA and 9.5 strikeouts per nine innings (SO9) through 17 IP.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>7. Kevin Gausman, Orioles</h2>
Baltimore’s Kevin Gausman has been on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis for much of the 2015 season, but before he went down he hurled a pitch clocked at 100.3 miles per hour. Before the injury, Gausman sported a 4.50 ERA and 9.8 SO9 in 12.0 innings of relief work for the <a title="Orioles" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/orioles/" target="_blank">Orioles</a>.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_807125" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-807125 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-474432340.jpg" alt="Justin K. Aller/Getty Images" width="757" height="493" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>6. Gerrit Cole, Pirates</h2>
Gerrit Cole has thrown faster before, but the Pirates right-hander is back in the century club in 2015 after throwing a fastball clocked at 100.3 miles per hour. In 10 games started (GS) for Pittsburgh, Cole is 7-2 with a 2.11 ERA and 9.8 SO9. Through 64.0 IP, Cole has 70 SO this season.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>5. Blake Treinen, Nationals</h2>
<a title="Nationals" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/nationals/" target="_blank">Nationals</a> reliever Blake Treinen joined the century club with an unusual pitch in 2015. Instead of the usual heater, Treinen actually cracked triple digits throwing a sinker that left his hand at 100.3 miles per hour. He has a 3.60 ERA and 9.4 SO9 in 2015. So you want to be a Major League hitter, folks? Imagine a sinker coming in at 100 miles per hour out of the hand of a 6-foot-5 pitcher. Good luck with that.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>4. Trevor Rosenthal, Cardinals</h2>
Trevor Rosenthal of <a title="St. Louis Cardinals" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/st-louis-cardinals/" target="_blank">St . Louis</a> returns to the century club for the fourth straight year in 2015, this time with a four-seam fastball clocked at 100.4 miles per hour. The Cardinals’ closer has been particularly nasty in this season, checking in with a 0.77 ERA, 14 saves, and 9.6 SO9.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>3. Nathan Eovaldi, Yankees</h2>
The Yankees’ Nathan Eovaldi leads <a title="MLB: Which Team Needs Cole Hamels the Most?" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports-2/mlb-which-team-needs-cole-hamels-the-most.html/" target="_blank">MLB</a> starters with an average velocity of 95.8 miles per hour for his fastball. With a straighter fastball than most pitchers on this list, Eovaldi doesn’t get the same type of swings and misses as the rest. He has posted a 4.13 ERA and 6.8 SO9 in 2015. Nonetheless, the fastball clocked at 100.6 miles per hour put him in the century club for the third straight year, and it was the right-hander’s fastest pitch to date.<!--nextpage-->

<h2>2. Arquimedes Caminero, Pirates</h2>
Prior to 2015, Arquimedes Caminero’s fastball velocity maxed out at 98.4 miles per hour, but he’s been eating his Wheaties this year. Already, Caminero has uncorked a four-seamer clocked at 101.1 miles per hour. Through 23 appearances, he has a 3.63 ERA and 10.1 SO9 for the <a title="Pirates" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/pirates/" target="_blank">Pirates</a>.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_807119" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-807119 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-473780676.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons Getty Images " width="757" height="480" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>1. Aroldis Chapman, Reds</h2>
Once we get to the <a title="Aroldis Chapman" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/aroldis-chapman/" target="_blank">Aroldis Chapman</a> page, we realize we are in an entirely different class of what Springsteen would call “speed-ballers." Chapman hit 102.8 with a four-seam fastball in 2015, and we expect him to break that mark at some point in the season. (He has hit 105 miles per hour in the past and 103.8 miles per hour in 2014.) How does that speed work for the Reds’ closer? Quite well, thank you. Chapman has a 1.69 ERA and 36 SO in 21.1 IP. That’s a filthy 15.2 So9.

		<description><![CDATA[Whether or not Pete Rose should be reinstated remains one of baseball's most contentious controversies.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_506998" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/03/Pete-Rose-Christopher-Pasatieri-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-506998" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Pete-Rose-Christopher-Pasatieri-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="571" /></a> Christopher Pasatieri/Getty Images[/caption]

2015 marks the twenty-sixth year that Pete Rose has been banned from baseball — one of the sport’s greatest controversies, and in many respects, one of its most disappointing revelations. Rose, arguably one of the greatest ever to play the game, has long been tainted after being charged with gambling and allegedly betting on his own team.

Despite Rose’s serious violation of a bevy of Major League Baseball rules and regulations, many fans — and Rose himself — believe he should be reinstated and allowed a place in the Hall of Fame: The two seemingly go hand in hand, as the Hall of Fame added a clause to its eligibility rules in 1990, stating that players who were on the ineligible list could not be considered as candidates.

We’ve compiled six key facts surrounding Rose’s ban. [Update: and now that Rose <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12494312/pete-rose-makes-formal-request-mlb-commissioner-rob-manfred-lift-life-ban" target="_blank">has sent a formal request to the MLB's new commissioner</a> to ask for reinstatement, we thought it was high time to revisit them]
<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_519576" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rose-Don-emmert-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-519576 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rose-Don-emmert-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="541" /></a> Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong> 1.</strong> On August 24, 1989 — nearly twenty-five years ago — Commissioner Bart Giamatti, after an in-house investigation, announced that Rose, baseball’s all-time hits leader and one of history’s greatest players, was banned for life for gambling on baseball. “The banishment for life of Pete Rose from baseball is the sad end of a sorry episode,” Giamatti said in a statement. “One of the game’s greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Despite his firm stance on the matter, Giamatti is credited with facilitating an agreement that “ended” the betting scandal and allowed Rose to voluntarily withdraw from the sport, avoiding further punishment. The next two commissioners, Fay Vincent and Bud Selig, have upheld this ban.

<strong>2.</strong> “The Dowd Report,” the result of an investigation by lawyer John M. Dowd, set out to prove that Rose did in fact bet on baseball games. In his research, Dowd found that Rose was betting on approximately five to ten games every day in basketball, football, hockey and baseball, at about $2,000 a game. In one month, Rose lost more than $67,000, and he was often deeply in debt to bookies — at one point, he owed a Staten Island bookie $200,000. Dowd handed over his research to Giamatti in May 1989. It was comprised of 225 pages and seven volumes of exhibits, which included bank and telephone records, alleged betting records, and transcripts of interviews with Rose and other witnesses.

<strong>3.</strong> Rose, who holds more records than any other player in the history of major league baseball, became the first person banned from the game since 1943. He left the game as the all-time Major League leader in hits (4,256), games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053), and outs (10,328). An incredibly dynamic player, Rose is also the only player in major league history to play more than 500 games at five different positions. In response to Giamatti’s ban, Rose insisted at the time that, “I don’t think I have a gambling problem at all.”

&nbsp;

<strong>4.</strong> Despite Rose’s continued denials on various levels of the charges against him, he voluntarily accepted a permanent place on baseball’s ineligible list; and critics say he has not really “fought” the charges. According to baseball’s rules, Rose could have applied for reinstatement after one year, but waited to apply until 1992 and 1997. Critics point out that had Rose had nothing to hide, then he would have had no reason to remain silent and accept an agreement to voluntarily withdraw from the sport. Commissioners Vincent and Selig have never responded to Rose’s reinstatement efforts.

<strong>5.</strong> Rose denied betting on baseball until an admission in 2004, when he finally came clean and said he bet without knowing how drastic the penalties would be. “You don’t think you’re going to get caught,” Rose told <em>ABC News</em>. “I think what happens is you’re, at the time, you’re betting football and then, then what’s after football is basketball and obviously the next thing that follows is baseball. It’s just a pattern that you got into.”

<strong>6.</strong> In simple language, the ban on Rose means he can’t appear at any official Major League Baseball functions. He also can’t take part in any pre- or post-game festivities involving the Cincinnati Reds (where he played and managed for 25 seasons) or in Philadelphia, where he played for five seasons with the Phillies. Still, Rose has been allowed a few exceptions, including an on-field appearance to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of his record-setting hit (No. 4,192), which broke Ty Cobb’s previous record.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The 2014 World Series will be a matchup of two wild-card teams, the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals. How many times has a wild card won it all?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_712890" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-712890 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/453447334.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="421" /> Ed Zurga/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants both entered the 2014 postseason at the end of September as wild-card teams. By mid-October, each club had won its respective pennant. The American League champion Royals and National League champion Giants will face off in the World Series starting Tuesday night, which guarantees that baseball&#8217;s last team standing will have come from the unassuming beginnings of the wild-card game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time since baseball expanded to two wild-card teams in each league in 2012 that a team has advanced from the relatively new wild-card game all the way to the Fall Classic, but it ensures a sixth World Series champion will come from the wild-card ranks since that invention first appeared in the MLB playoffs in 1995.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the previous five wild-card teams to win baseball&#8217;s biggest prize, listed in chronological order. (All stats and records are from <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com" target="_blank">Baseball-Reference.com</a>.) Will it be the Giants or Royals that join this exclusive club in the next two weeks?</p>

<h4>1997 Florida Marlins</h4>
<p>The first wild-card team to win the World Series was the 1997 Florida Marlins. Jim Leyland&#8217;s team went 92-70, finishing the regular season nine games behind the Braves in the National League East, but eliminated Atlanta in six games in the NLCS. In the World Series, Florida and Cleveland alternated wins in each game, but it was the Marlins that started that trend in Game 1 and finished it with a walk-off win in Game 7. Livan Hernandez won twice for Florida in the Fall Classic as the team captured its first World Series title in only its fifth year of existence.</p>

<h4>2002 Anaheim Angels</h4>
<p>The 2002 World Series pitted two wild-card teams against each other, as the NL&#8217;s Giants battled the AL&#8217;s Angels in an intrastate affair. The Angels weren&#8217;t any sort of significant underdog that year, having won 99 games, but they still finished four games behind the Athletics in the American League West. Anaheim disposed of the Twins in the ALDS and the Yankees in the ALCS to win the pennant. The all-wild-card World Series ultimately went the distance, with Anaheim rallying &#8212; in the year of the Rally Monkey &#8212; to take both Game 6 and Game 7 at home for the series victory.</p>

<h4>2003 Florida Marlins</h4>
<p>The wild card was good to the Marlins once again in 2003, as Florida again went from lowest team on the National League totem pole to champions. The Marlins only won 91 games in the regular season, 10 less than Atlanta, but got hot at the right time in October. Florida came back from down 3-1 in the NLCS to stun the Chicago Cubs &#8212; Steve Bartman may or may not have had something to do with that &#8212; and then knocked out the Yankees in six games to claim the crown. World Series MVP Josh Beckett had an ERA of just 1.10 in two starts for the strong-armed Fish, who also got a pair of victories from Brad Penny against New York.</p>

<h4>2004 Boston Red Sox</h4>
<p>One of the most famous wild-card teams to ever win the World Series has to be the 2004 Boston Red Sox, who not only snapped an 86-year curse (thank you very much, Babe Ruth), but rallied from down three games to none against the dreaded arch-rival Yankees in the ALCS to get there in the first place. Boston had won 98 games in the regular season, three less than the Bronx Bombers, but saved their best for last. Facing elimination, Terry Francona&#8217;s team reeled off eight wins in a row to stun the Yankees, sweep the Cardinals, and go down in Boston history as perhaps the most beloved of all world champs.</p>

<h4>2011 St. Louis Cardinals</h4>
<p>Only one wild-card team in the last decade has won the World Series, and it&#8217;s the 2011 Cardinals. St. Louis won 90 games in the regular season compared to 96 for NL Central champion Milwaukee, but got the best of the Brewers in a six-game NLCS after initially getting past the Phillies in the first round. That set up a championship battle with the Texas Rangers, who had the Cardinals down to their final out and even final strike but couldn&#8217;t close the deal. Series MVP David Freese led the Cards to a comeback extra-innings victory in Game 6, then St. Louis finished off the Rangers with a 6-2 win in Game 7 for just the team&#8217;s second championship since 1967.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_679325" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-679325 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Beijing-Stadiums-Handout-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Handout/Getty Images[/caption]

What is “a baseball city?” For some, the phrase evokes the Bronx or Boston, places that are dripping with baseball history. For others, a baseball city is a spot that has consistently harbored a warm appreciation for the game despite the lackluster showings of local clubs; Chicago is a prime example of this definition. For others still, a baseball city is a place that’s a hotbed of talent, anywhere where the sport is represented most often at the highest level. That’s the definition that we’ll be rolling with today.

A couple quick notes on the data that we’ll be using, <a href="http://sportchart.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">courtesy of <em>Sportchart</em></a>, according to the site, a city’s boundaries were held to a fairly strict standard, so if you don’t see a city like Los Angeles listed (spoiler alert: you won’t) consider that only Los Angeles is being counted, not Greater L.A. Now, on to the list.

<h3><strong>6. Miami, U.S.A. — 8 active players</strong></h3>
Now that the Heat have faded out of the picture, perhaps it’s time for the Miami Marlins to step into the power vacuum and absorb all the limelight? Well, maybe not, but the presence of eight MLB players that all call the Cruise Ship Capital of the World home has got to be a nice boost to local pride.

<h3><strong>5. Maracay, Venezuela — 8 active players</strong></h3>
Baseball is huge in the Southern Hemisphere, and the capital of Aragua — one of the states that make up Venezuela — has the same number of professional representatives as Miami. Historically, Venezuela has sent over 300 players into the MLB.

<h3><strong>4. San Pedro De Macorís, Dominican Republic — 9 active players</strong></h3>
San Pedro De Macorís, the homeplace of Sammy Sosa, now boasts nine active players in the MLB today, and the Dominican Republic has sent over 600 baseball players to the league. Sosa remains, arguably, the most famous, despite his tainted reputation and steroided legacy today.

<h3><strong>3. San Diego, U.S.A. — 10 active players</strong></h3>
California is the leading state in the United States when it comes to professional baseball players, watching more than 2,000 of its native sons go pro — followed by Illinois (over 1,000 players), Pennsylvania (over 1,300), and New York (1,100 plus), and Ohio, which is one shy of a thousand players. Today, though, San Diego takes top honors as the most represented Californian city in the MLB.

<h3><strong>2. Houston, U.S.A. — 15 players
</strong></h3>
Right now, Houston, Texas is the birthplace of the most concentrated batch of American Major League Baseball players in the league today. To play the percentages, 22 percent of American baseball stars come from California (as a state), followed by Texas, with 11.5 percent, and Florida, coming in at an even 10.6 percent.

<h3><strong>1. Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — 18</strong></h3>
The city that’s best represented through the MLB on the world stage is Santo Domingo, which could nearly field a 25 man roster of their own (and, combined with the Domincan Republic’s other representative, they could.) While concerns about baseball’s popularity may be a province of North America’s relationship to the sport, it appears that the further south you go, the more exciting the idea of baseball is.

		<description><![CDATA[Here are eight MLB pitchers who have fired fastballs of 100 mph or faster in 2014.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="MLB" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/category/sports-2/mlb/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> batting averages are at their lowest in 2014 (.252) since 1972, while strikeouts are at their highest rate (7.70 per game) in baseball’s 144 years of recorded history. According to the players, flame-throwing relief pitchers deserve much of the blame. Instead of trying to knock out a team’s starter to get to the soft underbelly out in the bullpen, hitters are wary of the heat they face when managers call in relievers.

Indeed, in efastball.com’s list of pitchers who have thrown <a href="http://www.efastball.com/baseball/stats/fastest-pitch-speed-in-major-leagues/" target="_blank">102 mph or faster</a> in MLB history, sixteen of the twenty-one listed hit their marks in the 2002 season or later. It is no longer a rarity in the game. While most come firing out of the bullpen in setup or closer roles, hitters are unlucky enough to see similar velocities from starters these days (the best averages 96.4 mph at press time).

Here are eight pitchers who have thrown pitches of 100 mph or better in 2014, according to <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/pitch-fx/" target="_blank">PITCHf/x data on Fangraphs.com</a>. Since PITCHf/x is the most scientific testing method, the results sometimes dispute what radar guns say and, in many cases, <a href="http://www.efastball.com/articles/2014/08/cbs-yordano-ventura-did-not-throw-102.8-in-april-2014/" target="_blank">published reports</a> of how fast pitchers have thrown. Stats are current as of August 7, 2014. Pitchers are listed from the “slowest” 100+ mph pitch thrown during the 2014 season to the fastest.

<h4>8. Gerrit Cole, Pirates</h4>
Pittsburgh’s Gerrit Cole went on the disabled list July 5, but not before the right-handed starter joined the century club in 2014 after <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=13125&amp;position=P" target="_blank">hitting 100.0 mph</a> in 2014. That wasn’t the highest velocity the young righty has clocked to date. In 2013, Cole hit 101.0 mph with a fastball. He is averaging 8.19 strikeouts per nine innings (K/9) as a starter in 2014.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>7. Jake McGee, Rays</h4>
Welcome to the 100 Club, Jake McGee. The Rays reliever broke the century mark for the first time ever in 2014 when he clocked <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=7550&amp;position=P" target="_blank">100.2 mph</a> out of the Rays pen. Prior to this season, McGee topped out at 99.1 mph, which he hit in 2013. McGee is sporting a 1.44 ERA with 12 saves in 54 appearances for Tampa in 2014 with 11.70 K/9.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683000" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683000 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/452909306-640x484-2.jpg" alt="New York Yankees v Texas Rangers" width="640" height="484" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>6. Dellin Betances, Yankees</h4>
New York Yankees relievers are leading MLB in strikeouts and are nearing the all-time mark for a bullpen K/9. The lion’s share of that production is coming from David Robertson (14.63 K/9) and stud setup man Dellin Betances. In 50 games in 2014, Betances has devastated opponents with his fastball and curve while posting 13.30 K/9. He has also joined the 100 Club.

Betances <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=6216&amp;position=P" target="_blank">hit 100.4 mph</a> August 2, 2014 in Boston. Fenway Park’s radar gun actually read 101 mph, but PITCHf/x delivered the accurate figure later, which MLB officials confirmed.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683010" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683010 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/453124950-640x426.jpg" alt="Milwaukee Brewers v St. Louis Cardinals" width="640" height="426" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>5. Trevor Rosenthal, Cardinals</h4>
The St. Louis Cardinals’ Trevor Rosenthal is no stranger to the 100 Club. Rosenthal hit 101.4 mph in 2013 and 100.9 in 2012. There has been not let-up in 2014. Though his 3.19 ERA and 1-6 record are down compared to the rest of his career, Rosenthal <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=10745&amp;position=P" target="_blank">hit 100.5 mph in 2014</a>. Whatever the problem is, it isn’t the velocity. He has 35 saves with 11.40 K/9 in his first season as a closer.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683013" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683013 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/452433490-640x433.jpg" alt="Kansas City Royals v Boston Red Sox" width="640" height="433" /> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>4. Yordano Ventura, Royals</h4>
Yordano Ventura has been one of the key pieces of the Kansas City Royals’ success in 2014. In 21 starts, Ventura is 9-8 with a 3.47 ERA and 7.80 K/9. His 96.2 average fastball velocity (96.4 for two-seamers) ranks second-best in MLB among starters behind Garrett Richards. That’s a tall order for batters, especially when <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=11855&amp;position=P" target="_blank">he hits 100.8 mph</a>, as he did earlier in 2014. Ventura nailed his highest pitch speed of 101.9 during his late-2013 debut.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683037" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683037 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/452100982-640x427.jpg" alt="M" width="640" height="427" /> Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>3. Carlos Martinez, Cardinals</h4>
Another flamethrower currently on the shelf, Carlos Martinez has hit <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=10745&amp;position=P" target="_blank">100.9 mph in 2014</a>, his first full MLB season. While control is an issue for Martinez (4.08 BB/9), velocity is not. His highest pitch speed was clocked at 101.3 mph by PITCHf/x in 2013, while he is averaging fastballs of 96.2 mph mph in 2014 (2-4, 4.74 ERA). Martinez is averaging 8.43 K/9.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683039" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683039 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/452080570-640x476.jpg" alt="452080570 (640x476)" width="640" height="476" /> Ed Zurga/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>2. Kelvin Herrera, Royals</h4>
Then there is the 101 Club of 2014. The Royals’ Kelvin Herrera <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=6033&amp;position=P" target="_blank">nailed 101.4 mph</a> earlier this season, which gave him one of the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/like-aroldis-chapman-royals-kelvin-herrera-known-to-bring-heat?ymd=20140801&amp;content_id=87420544&amp;vkey=news_mlb" target="_blank">top 100 fastest pitches</a> of the season (the other 99 belong to <a title="5 Cuban MLB Players Who Are Raising the Bar" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/5-cuban-mlb-players-who-are-raising-the-bar.html/" target="_blank">the Cuban Missile</a>). It’s actually a step down for Herrera. In 2012, he nailed 102.8 mph, according to PITCHf/x. In 48 appearances this season, Herrera has a posted a 1.69 ERA out of the ‘pen with 7.50 K/9.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_683054" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-683054 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/452540108-640x427.jpg" alt="452540108 (640x427)" width="640" height="427" /> Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>1. Aroldis Chapman, Reds</h4>
He may not have thrown the fastest pitch in MLB history (by some standards), but the Reds’ Aroldis Chapman is alone in the 103 club in 2014. In fact, he<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/pitchfx.aspx?playerid=10233&amp;position=P" target="_blank"> hit 103.8 mph</a> in a July contest against Arizona. The Cuban Missile put on a speed clinic that outing, which had disputed results following initial reports <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/reds-closer-aroldis-chapman-threw-15-pitches-at-or-above-101-mph-monday?ymd=20140729&amp;content_id=86822504&amp;vkey=news_mlb" target="_blank">he hit 104 mph</a>. Chapman has an absurd rate of 17.65 K/9 in 2014.

Chapman has the record for fastest pitch of the PITCHf/x era at 105.1 mph (2010), though efastball.com has Bob Feller (in 1946) and Nolan Ryan (in 1974) topping that mark by “artillery” and “Doppler laser radar” testing methods, respectively. The efastball.com measurements will fascinate baseball fans, but the moral of this story is there is no reason to hit the books or search websites to discover 100 mph fastballs. They are being thrown by pitchers on a nightly basis at a Major League Baseball park near you.

If you’d like to study the financing details of a ten-year player contract to find out how much so-and-so will make in 2021, there’s a stat for that. On the other hand, trying to find how much a baseball team’s manager earns is like trying to nab state secrets from a tight-lipped Soviet spy.

Some details have managed to leak out in recent years on the salaries of the game’s high profile skippers. None of them makes even the top ten on the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45edkig/the-highest-paid-coaches-in-american-sports-2013/" target="_blank"><em>Forbes</em> best-paid U.S. coaches</a> list.

When legends Jim Leyland, Bobby Cox, and Tony LaRussa retired, that left job openings at some of the sport’s top franchises. At least for now, baseball team owners are paying enormous sums to ballplayers but are getting the better end of the bargain when it comes to managers. Maybe that’s why teams are not forthcoming when it comes to how much their skippers earn. Based on the evidence at hand, here are the six top-paid managers in baseball for 2014.

<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mattingly.jpg"><img class="wp-image-632850 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mattingly.jpg" alt="Mattingly" width="640" height="427" /></a>
<h4>6. Don Mattingly, Los Angeles Dodgers: $1.5-$1.7 million</h4>
Don Mattingly caught a great deal of flack in 2013 while trying to lead his injury-battered team to the playoffs (which he did). LA wisely resigned the former Yankee captain and rock in the dugout at Dodger Stadium ahead of the 2014 season. While management kept the details of the three-year contract under wraps, estimates based on Mattingly’s previously reported salary put his new deal in the range of $3.5 million to $5 million over the three years.

That puts Donnie Baseball around $1.6 million per year in 2014, making him one of the highest paid managers in the game. He earns about half that just for dealing with <a title="Yasiel Puig" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/yasiel-puig/" target="_blank">Yasiel Puig</a> on a daily basis.

<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Joe-Maddon.jpg"><img class="wp-image-632852 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Joe-Maddon.jpg" alt="Keith Allison via Flickr" width="640" height="549" /></a>
<h4>5. Joe Maddon, Tampa Bay Rays: $2 million</h4>
Many consider Joe Maddon to be the best manager in baseball, but he won’t be paid the most in 2014. That fits in nicely with the Rays philosophy of getting the most out of their buck. <a title="Moneyball" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/tag/moneyball/" target="_blank">Moneyball</a> extends to the coaching staff as well as the players on the field. Maddon signed a three-year extension with Tampa worth approximtely $6 million, or $2 million a year, through the 2015 season.

Since his first two-year contract worth a total of $1.1 million ($550,000 per year) for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, Maddon has gotten a raise at every new contract negotiation. There’s no reason to believe that trend won’t continue once his current contract ends after the 2015 season.

Note: Ron Gardenhire, whose salary is impossible to estimate, probably earns more than Mattingly and Maddon in 2014.

<h4>4. Buck Showalter, Baltimore Orioles $2.6-$2.9 million</h4>
Baltimore had made the excellent draft picks by the time Buck Showalter was hired as manager, but they lacked the leadership and team culture that would turn the quality personnel into a winning baseball team. Showalter seemed to manage that feat overnight when he came on as skipper at the end of the 2010 season. Before the 2013 season, Baltimore extended Showalter’s contract through 2018.

After making $1.5 million per year in his previous deal, Showalter was reportedly going to earn “<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/bal-orioles-buck-showalter-dan-duquette-contract-extensions-20130116,0,2885818.story" target="_blank">somewhat less than $3 million</a> per year through 2018,” according to sources speaking with the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>. In other words, owner Peter Angelos rewarded his talented skipper appropriately.

<h4>3.Terry Francona, Cleveland Indians: $3-4 million</h4>
There is no public acknowledgment that Terry Francona is making over $3 million per year to manage the Cleveland Indians, but the evidence behind this conclusion is convincing. Francona made over $3 million a year managing Boston and had even higher paying options about to go into effect. When he took the job in Cleveland, it was a situation where the team needed him more than he needed the Indians. The estimates of a minimum $3 million per annum ranks Francona in the upper echelon of manager salaries for the 2014 season.

<h4>2. Joe Girardi, New York Yankees: $4 million</h4>
When Joe Girardi took over for Joe Torre in the Bronx at the start of the 2008 season, he had one directive: bring home World Series title No. 27  to the Yankees. Girardi wore the number on his back to remind himself of this goal on a daily basis. In 2009, the Yankees added a twenty-seventh banner to the impossible collection, so Girardi went and changed his number to 28.

It’s this singular focus Yankees brass loves in the former catcher who won championships with the Yankees as both player and manager. The daily grind of press conferences and media blitzes in New York is no cake walk, but Girardi has mastered the art of answering every question while saying very little. Nothing works quite like boring the relentless media to death. This technique has allowed Girardi to keep the focus on the field and give his players the mental space to do their job. He’s paid handsomely for his work at $4 million a year.

<a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mike-Scioscia.jpg"><img class="wp-image-632867 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Mike-Scioscia.jpg" alt="Keith Allison Flickr" width="640" height="406" /></a>
<h4>1. Mike Scioscia, Los Angeles Angels: $5 million</h4>
Angels manager Mike Scioscia was always a skipper whose mark was immediately recognizable when he had the baserunners to execute his aggressive style of play. Since his team has been stocked with slower power hitters in recent years, it’s more difficult to see the Scioscia effect on his team. However, he received the biggest payday in managerial history when owner Arte Moreno gave Scioscia a ten-year deal reportedly worth $50 million.

Signed through the 2018 season, Scioscia has the type of job security that is rare in professional sports. Even if the Angels were unhappy with their manager, firing him would prove so costly it wouldn’t make sense. Scioscia remains one of the most strategically skilled managers in the game. He’s definitely the highest paid.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_634421" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wrigley-Stadium-source-M.janicki-Flickr.jpg"><img class="wp-image-634421 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wrigley-Stadium-source-M.janicki-Flickr.jpg" alt="Source: M.janicki, Flickr" width="640" height="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: M.janicki, Flickr</p></div>
<p>On this day 100 years ago, Chicago&#8217;s Wrigley Field opened to a public ready and eager to enjoy what was undeniably the game that everyone played whenever they had the chance. At least, that&#8217;s the narrative that baseball likes to believe, and the gravity of the sport&#8217;s history &#8212; compared to its upstart contemporaries, the NFL, the NBA, and, because the world is obviously a worse place now than it was in 1914, <a href="http://thebiglead.com/2014/03/07/mls-just-as-popular-as-baseball-with-american-kids-according-to-a-new-poll/" target="_blank">even the MLS</a> &#8211; demands that we pay homage to the cultural fabric of baseball. It&#8217;s why Wrigley became such a national treasure, despite the Cubs&#8217; widely lamented allergy to ultimate success.</p>
<p>It is rightly called the Friendly Confines, and for people who enjoy baseball, Wrigley Field &#8212; along with the the other stadiums that have stood with the MLB for so long &#8212; evokes all kinds of nostalgia, even among those who have only seen it on television or in photographs. Or, in a technological twist worthy of Asimov, YouTube clips.</p>
<p>So, while Wrigley Field will keep on keeping on (and you can read all about how vintage and venerable and lovely it is <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mlb/news/20140423/wrigley-field-100th-anniversary-chicago-cubs/" target="_blank">over at <em>Sports Illustrated</em></a>), here are some other ball parks that will be passing the century mark before squiggly text can run across your screen and say &#8220;100 years in the future&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<div id="attachment_634477" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/O.co-Coliseum-source-Bryce_edwards-Flickr.jpg"><img class="wp-image-634477 size-full" src="http://cdn.wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/O.co-Coliseum-source-Bryce_edwards-Flickr.jpg" alt="Source: Bryce_edwards, Flickr" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Bryce_edwards, Flickr</p></div>
<h3><strong>5. The O.co Coliseum &#8212; September 18, 1966</strong></h3>
<p>This is a bit of a weird one &#8212; as a stadium that featured both NFL and MLB teams, the O.co first opened for a Kansas City Chiefs/Oakland Raiders football game, and it didn&#8217;t see MLB action until 1968 when the Kansas City Athletics moved Northwest and became the Oakland A&#8217;s, playing their first game on April 17, 1968 to a crowd of over 50 thousand, <a href="http://ballparksofbaseball.com" target="_blank">according to a report</a>. The O.co saw the Raiders leave for Los Angeles, and then return in a move that saw the arena expanded into what it looks like today &#8212; more or less. It remains the only professional sports arena to have baseball and football played on the same field, as the Raiders and the A&#8217;s have overlapping seasons. You can see the Raiders playing on the A&#8217;s turf in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAG3SQy8Dss" target="_blank">many of these Terrelle Pryor highlights</a> from the 2013 NFL season (there&#8217;s an especially good one at the 2:40 mark.)</p>
<h3><strong>4. The Angels Stadium of Anaheim &#8212; April 11, 1966</strong></h3>
<p>While the O.co was dealing with the Raiders and waiting for the A&#8217;s to show up, the Angels Stadium has always been for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Built as a way for the Angels to escape cohabitation with the Dodgers at the appropriately named Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim found themselves sharing space for a decade and a half with the Los Angeles Rams. This video tour  does an excellent job of showing the stadium decked out for an afternoon of baseball.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Dodger Stadium &#8212; April 10, 1962</strong></h3>
<p>It was probably pretty easy to figure out that Dodger Stadium was going to be next on this list, what with the Angels having played in it before their own arena was finished in 1966. The largest capacity baseball venue in the United States, the DS came about because of Brooklyn&#8217;s unwillingness to sell enough land to then team president Walter O&#8217;Malley back in the &#8217;50s. Eventually, O&#8217;Malley effectively said &#8216;screw it&#8217; and jumped ship to the warm weather and private funding of Los Angeles, starting the construction in 1959 and finishing it in time for the 1962 season.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the construction of Dodger Stadium have been contentious and shrouded in emotions ever since it began when the neighborhoods that made up Chavez Ravine were leveled in order for the Dodgers to play in Los Angeles. While the team had left Brooklyn in 1958, they played in the Los Angeles Metro Arena for the three years that Dodger Stadium was under construction. You can see  footage of the stadium on opening day, as well as before and after footage of the valley in this YouTube clip.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Wrigley Field &#8212; April 23, 1914</strong></h3>
<p>Well hello again, Wrigley. Nice to see you. What did we miss the first time? Oh, how about the fact that you didn&#8217;t install night lights until 1988? Or the fact that while you opened in 1914, you weren&#8217;t home to the Cubs or the MLB at all? That&#8217;s a fact. <a href="http://www.ballparksofbaseball.com/nl/WrigleyField.htm" target="_blank">Per BallparksOfBaseball</a>, the first team to play there was the Chicago Whales of the Federal League. Once the Federal League went under in 1916, the Cubs moved in, and the field&#8217;s name was changed to Wrigley Field in 1926. Happy 100th birthday, the stadium formerly known as Weeghman Field. You&#8217;re the second oldest functioning stadium in America.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Fenway Park &#8212; September 25, 1911</strong></h3>
<p>Second only to Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox &#8212; a field that refuses to fold over and die for a newer version the way the old Yankees Stadium disappeared in 2008. It is tiny. The seats are tiny, the capacity is tiny, and the lines are massive. Like Wrigley, Fenway is cherished for its old-fashioned quirks, and both parks remain national landmarks for baseball fans &#8212; a veritable pilgrimage destinations for the believers of the stiched cowhide.</p>

<blockquote><em>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack / I don’t care if I ever get back…</em></blockquote>
There’s plenty of downtime at every Major League Baseball game. In fact, the sport has breaks built into each half-inning, not to mention the breaks in between every pitch thrown and the seventh-inning stretch, when fans limber up and sing the classic “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” Baseball was invented in the 19th century, when things moved slower and people didn’t mind the pauses.

To compensate for so many breaks, modern baseball stadiums go heavy on sound effects, mid-inning promotions, stunts, mascots, and a variety of other distractions. One of the most enduring traditions involves popular songs fans sing at certain moments of the game.

Some are rallying cries that have come to signify a team’s culture as a whole; others provide comic relief or a way to assert dominance at the close of a sweet victory. Here are five signature songs fans of MLB teams love to sing at their respective stadiums.<!--nextpage-->

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kbtIR3YD6OY" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4>1. Dodger Stadium: “I Love L.A.<strong>“</strong></h4>
Nothing says “the 1980s are alive” quite like Randy Newman’s “I Love L.A.,” which first appeared in 1983 on the album <em>Trouble in Paradise</em> (surely available on 8-track at the time). When Dodgers fans hear the tune’s strains, it’s time to get fired up in the stands, to celebrate a win, or to simply check out some famous people in attendance on the Dodger Stadium Jumbotron. It’s pop bubble gum music at its best, which makes it the ideal soundtrack for a lazy summer’s day at Chavez Ravine.

With the recent success of the Dodgers franchise, a fan might hope for a more menacing battle cry to lead the Dodgers on a late-game charge, but “I Love L.A.” is the song of choice for now. Yasiel Puig, Clayton Kershaw, et al, will provide fireworks on their own.<!--nextpage-->

<h4>2. <strong>Comerica Park: “Don’t Stop Believing”</strong></h4>
Armed with arguably the game’s best pitcher (Justin Verlander) and best hitter (Miguel Cabrera), the Detroit Tigers give their fans plenty to cheer about at Comerica Park on a nightly basis. In a less-than-stellar American League Central, the Tigers have a shot at delivering another division title and trying their luck in the playoffs. Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” is a tune you will hear behind many of the Tigers rallies.

At the words “born and raised in South Detroit,” the Comerica Park faithful let the world know where they stand. It’s one of those happy instances where a classic song references both the city and its hopes of another World Series title — not to mention the belief in a comeback for Detroit as a whole.<!--nextpage-->

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/G4CU1l95h9w" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4>3. Yankees Stadium “YMCA” (Honorary mention: “New York, New York”)</h4>
In the land of Broadway extravanganzas and celebrity sightings by the second, you can’t blame New York’s Yankee Stadium grounds crew for wanting to show off their dance moves mid-game. They get their chance when the Village People’s “YMCA” blares over the loudspeakers before the bottom of the sixth inning. Part tourist spectacle, part crowd-pleaser, and part fan dance-off, the members of the grounds crew drop their equipment and perform to the disco classic on a nightly basis.

According to legend, the tradition started in 1996, when the grounds crew gave “YMCA” a whirl during one rain delay. The crowd demanded they keep the show going, and the owners obliged. A second Yankee Stadium song tradition worth mentioning is the Frank Sinatra version of “New York, New York” played after every win. Does any song represent New York swagger more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=HY3SBnymac4#t=30" target="_blank">this Ol’ Blue Eyes classic</a>?<!--nextpage-->

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OxyjkXrUzdE" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4>4. Chicago Cubs: “Take Me Out the Ballgame”</h4>
It’s true that you’ll hear “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” at every MLB stadium during the seventh-inning stretch. However, no city or team honors the tradition of this classic like the Chicago Cubs do at Wrigley Field every game. The late, great Cubs announcer Harry Caray used to lead the crowd in a spirited rendition during the stretch, but his death in 1998 has passed the duties to random celebrities and other public figures.

A guest singer now leads the Wrigley Field crowd from the announcer’s box, no matter how bad his or her vocal abilities may be. It’s terrific fun at a place celebrating 100 years of professional baseball in 2014. Here’s to Wrigley at 100, in loving memory of Caray.<!--nextpage-->

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YynfrH5GHlw" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<h4>5. Fenway Park: “Sweet Caroline”</h4>
Perhaps no team has a song as embedded in its DNA like the Red Sox do with “Sweet Caroline.” Longtime fan Neil Diamond will occasionally show up to sing the song himself, but otherwise, fans belt out the tune karaoke-style before the start of the eighth inning of every game. It’s part celebration, part nostalgia, and part rallying cry for the team to make a last-minute surge, depending on the score and game situation.

Red Sox fans not only sing the lyrics of “Sweet Caroline” — in addition, they belt out the musical break (a horn section in the actual song) at the end of the chorus’s opening and third line. As with any stadium anthem sung after a long game, it’s about the fun and spirit of participation rather than pure musical quality. Indeed, Mr. Diamond, “Good times never seemed so good.”
