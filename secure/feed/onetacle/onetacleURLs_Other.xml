Just days after the start of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, we can't believe how many <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-things-rio-olympics.html/">issues are still plaguing these Games</a>. The water is sickly gross, the accommodations in Olympic Village are hazardous, and the possibility of being affected by the Zika virus is real. These Olympics have a chance to be among the most disastrous we've ever seen -- and that's saying something.

We usually envision the Olympic Games as a time of great joy. The best athletes from around the world come together, compete on behalf of their country, and vie for something that, when it's all said and done, is much more important than a medal: national pride. The only problem: The Games themselves aren't always full of happiness and jubilation.

Throughout history, the Olympics has seen its fair of tragedy. Some circumstances are mild; others, not so much. Just like the Olympics themselves, tragedy can bring people -- and countries -- together as they show solidarity and pride. Regardless, we hope the 2016 Rio Olympics are safe and fun for everyone involved.

In our opinion, these are the six worst things to ever happen at the Olympics.
<h2>1. Who kicks a referee?</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CecGsG_4yoc"></iframe>

We've seen instances of unsportsmanlike conduct before, but nothing quite like what Cuba's Angel Matos did during the bronze-medal taekwondo match at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After being disqualified for taking too much injury time, Matos reacted in a matter unbecoming of the Olympics Games, as he <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer08/judo/news/story?id=3549903">kicked the referee</a> -- Chakir Chelbat of Sweden -- right in the face.  This incident immediately prompted the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) to recommend and enforce a lifetime ban for Matos.

<h2>2. Those poor doves</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NxxbLJp_qLs"></iframe>

The lighting of the Olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony of the Games is usually a beautiful spectacle to behold. That was not the case during the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Instead of releasing ceremonial doves after the cauldron was lit, the exact opposite happened, resulting in some of the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/embarrassing-olympic-gaffes-to-remember-223138561.html">birds being burned alive</a>. At least this awful displayed wasn't televised -- oh wait, it was. Oops.

<h2>3. The 1960 Games do not go as planned</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676415" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676415" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Knud-Jensen-Central-Press-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="6 Worst Things That Have Ever Happened at the Olympics" width="757" height="599" /> Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen collapses during the 100K team time trial at the 1960 Rome Olympics | Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

Many memorable things occurred during the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Not only was it the first Olympics to be <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-televised-olympics">broadcasted live across Europe</a>, but it was also when the world got introduced to Muhammad Ali, then Cassius Clay, <a href="http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/on-this-day-cassius-clay-wins-gold-at-the-rome-olympics-in-1960/">who won gold in the light-heavyweight division</a>. Unfortunately, not all of these memorable moments were positive.

These Games also featured the <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2010-08-24-644446050_x.htm">first-ever doping scandal</a>, when Danish cyclist Knud Jensen, who was found to have Roniacol in his system, collapsed during a race and died the same day because of a fractured skull. This was a horrible event, and one that changed the Olympics forever.

<h2>4. Boycott at the 1980 Summer Olympics</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jL_8vpos-Fk"></iframe>

After the Soviet Union failed to remove its troops from Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would be <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/carter-announces-olympic-boycott">boycotting the 1980 Summer Olympics</a> in Moscow. While this decision was popular among the American people, with 55% supporting the move, Olympians did not feel the same way.

<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/carter-olympic-boycott-1980-103308">Said Julian Roosevelt</a>, an American member of the International Olympic Committee: "Any boycott isn’t going to change the Soviets’ mind and isn’t going to get troops out of Afghanistan. I’m as patriotic as the next guy, but the patriotic thing to do is for us to send a team over there and whip their ass.

<h2>5. Bombing at Centennial Olympic Park</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676425" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676425" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1996-Atlanta-Olymics-Al-Bello-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="6 Worst Things That Have Ever Happened at the Olympics" width="757" height="489" /> Tragedy at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta | Al Bello/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

You can't discuss the 1996 Summer Olympic in Atlanta and not talk about the bombing that took place at <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bombing-at-centennial-olympic-park">Centennial Olympic Park</a>. This horrible act of terrorism resulted in the death of two people (one directly, one later of a heart attack), over 100 injured, and the <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=judgingjewell">false accusation of security guard Richard Jewell</a>. Eventually, the real bomber, Eric Robert Rudolph, was captured and sentenced to four consecutive life terms.

<h2>6. Munich Massacre</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676429" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676429" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Munich-massacre-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="6 Worst Things That Have Ever Happened at the Olympics" width="757" height="566" /> A Palestinian guerilla member appears on the balcony of the Israeli house watching an official during the 1972 Munich Olympics | AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/massacre-begins-at-munich-olympics">Munich Massacre</a> is easily the worst thing to ever happen at the Olympics.

The <a href="https://www.olympic.org/munich-1972">1972 Summer Olympics in Munich</a> featured an act of horror unlike anything we've ever experienced at the Olympic Games. On September 5, a Palestinian terrorist group called "Black September" raided the apartment of Israeli athletes in Olympic Village. They killed two athletes and took another nine individuals hostage. In the end, all nine Israeli hostages were killed, as well as five terrorists and one West German police officer.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_683150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683150" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sad-Denver-Fan-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="A Denver Broncos fan mourns a loss." width="757" height="504" /> Life isn't always easy in Denver | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Being a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/green-bay-packers-best-fans-nfl.html/">sports fan</a> is largely an exercise in futility. It doesn’t matter which sport, and it doesn’t matter which city; the odds are decidedly stacked against any given team winning any given title, year in and year out. That’s part of the fun when it comes to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/celebrity-sports-fans-and-the-teams-they-love.html/">rooting for a team</a> that does win <span class="s1">-- </span>enjoying the victory and the emotional vindication that comes from a victory is phenomenal.

This is also <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-teams-fans-come-see.html/">why fans watch</a> other teams in the Super Bowl, World Series, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-ranking-lebron-jamess-finals-appearances.html/">NBA Finals</a>, or World Cup; jumping on the bandwagon still gives you a rush. Sadly, watching your team lose year after year is draining.

Here are eight sports cities that have struggled to win sports championships in the major American professional leagues recently, despite having more than 100 seasons to do so. We rank the cities by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">how many titles they’ve won</a> against how many seasons they’ve had the chance to do it. (If you read closely, you can still feel the despondency.) All years are rounded off, because no one cares about decimals when discussing time. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Denver – <strong>32 seasons per title</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_572136" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572136" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shane-Ray-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="A Denver Broncos play chews bubblegum as he waits for the game to start." width="757" height="505" /> Denver teams don't always win | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Broncos</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Rockies</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Nuggets</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Rockies, Avalanche</li>
</ul>
It's true. Peyton Manning brought Broncos fans a title <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-athletes-retire-champions.html/">before walking away</a> from the game of football. However, that doesn't mean the Mile High City hasn't <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-the-8-teams-that-have-never-won-the-world-series.html/">suffered its fair share</a> of sports heartbreak. First of all, the NHL version of the Colorado Rockies are now the New Jersey Devils. They moved in 1982.

Second, Denver’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-super-bowl-blowouts-nfl-history.html/">amassed just five</a> sports championships in almost 160 combined seasons. The Broncos won two championships in the late ’90s and another in 2015, while the Avalanche have hoisted two Cups -- in ’96 and 2001 -- since coming into existence in 1995–96. Five titles is nice, but it's not enough to change the narrative in Denver.

<h2>7. Kansas City, Mo. – 43 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570284" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570284" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jamaal-Charles-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-640x401.jpg" alt="Jamaal Charles looks at the scoreboard as he sits on the bench." width="757" height="475" /> Jamaal Charles knows what it's like to suffer | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Chiefs</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Kings</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Athletics, Royals</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Scouts</li>
</ul>
Most notable for its franchises that traveled to other locations <span class="s1">-- </span>the A’s, the Scouts (who became the Rockies, who became the Devils), and the Kings (now in Sacramento) <span class="s1">-- </span>Kansas City’s fanbase has had a rough go of it, winning just three titles over 130 seasons. The Royals <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-world-series-upsets.html/">won two sports championships</a> -- fortunately the most recent occurred <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/KCR/2015.shtml">in 2015</a> -- and the Chiefs won one. The Kings did win a title back in 1951, however, the team was the Rochester Royals at the time. So, once again, it sucks to be from K.C.

<h2>6. Buffalo, N.Y. – 56 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_723159" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-723159" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Buffalo-Bills-Brett-Carlsen-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Buffalo Bills stand on the field after a bad play." width="757" height="505" /> It's not easy being a sports fan in Buffalo | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Buffalo Bills</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Braves</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Sabres</li>
</ul>
On one hand, Buffalo has only won a pair of sports championships in 111 years. On the other hand, once the Braves left, they became somebody else’s sad embarrassment, turning into the much-maligned Los Angeles Clippers. If your team isn’t winning, it’s important to look for silver linings. Then again, when it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-teams-didnt-win-super-bowl.html/">comes to the Bills</a>, there really aren't any.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Houston – 77 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719168" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719168" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-3-640x427.jpg" alt="Brock Osweiler grips his helmet after an interception." width="757" height="505" /> Brock isn't helping things in Houston | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Texans, Oilers</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Astros</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Rockets</li>
</ul>
With three of the big four American sports (sorry, soccer) represented in H-Town, plus another that was uprooted in the Houston Oilers <span class="s1">-- </span>now the Tennessee Titans <span class="s1">-- </span>this city in the Lone Star state hasn’t been able to nab a sports championship since 1995, when the Rockets took advantage of Michael Jordan’s first retirement <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-best-teams-90s-except-bulls.html/">to win back-to-back NBA championship</a>s.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Cleveland – 80 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683271" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683271" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ramon-Sessions-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="A Cleveland Cavaliers player puts a towel over his head while he sits on the bench." width="757" height="505" /> The Cleveland Cavaliers haven't always won | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Rams, Browns</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Cavaliers</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Indians</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Barons</li>
</ul>
While the Browns continue to make their city the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-teams-that-made-the-playoffs-with-a-losing-record.html/">laughingstock of the NFL</a>, things aren't all bad in Cleveland. After all, by overcoming a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 NBA Finals, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/">LeBron James</a> and the Cavs recently ended Cleveland's 52-year championship drought. Of course, the Indians managed to blow a similar three games to one lead over the Cubs in the 2016 Series. So, yeah, that one stings a bit.

<h2>3. San Diego – 114 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_476150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-476150" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/San-Diego-Charges-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="San Chargers teammates hang their heads as they sit on the sidelines." width="757" height="525" /> Things keep getting worse and worse in San Diego | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Chargers</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Padres</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Clippers, Rockets</li>
</ul>
The Clippers are now in Los Angeles, the Rockets are now in Houston, and the only victory in San Diego history is a 1963 AFL title, courtesy of the Chargers. This is, shall we say, not a satisfied sports community. We'd like to say things couldn't <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-sports-franchises-desperately-need-a-championship.html/">get any worse for San Diego</a>, but we'd be lying. Now that the Chargers are moving to Los Angeles, the city has no pro football team. Hopefully, beautiful weather is an adequate consolation prize. Although, we highly doubt it.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Phoenix – 117 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_683277" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683277" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Phoenix-Suns-Lisa-Blumenfeld-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Suns players look dejected on the bench." width="757" height="495" /> So much sadness in Phoenix | Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Cardinals</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Suns</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Diamondbacks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Coyotes</li>
</ul>
The Diamondbacks gave Phoenix something to celebrate back in 2001, when they shocked the New York Yankees in the World Series. Other than that, Valley of the Sun residents wouldn't know a sports championship <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-franchises-longest-title-droughts.html/">if it hit them in the head</a>. Of course, real connoisseurs of schadenfreude know that some dicey officiating definitely screwed the Suns back in 2007.

<h2>1. Atlanta – 170 seasons per title</h2>
[caption id="attachment_732055" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-732055" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Kent-Bazemore-Atlanta-Hawks-640x441.jpg" alt="Kent Bazemore reacts after being called for a foul." width="757" height="521" /> This is a common reaction for Atlanta sports fans | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams</span>:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NFL</span>: Falcons</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">MLB</span>: Braves</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NBA</span>: Hawks</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NHL</span>: Thrashers, Flames</li>
</ul>
The Hawks consistently fall short of expectations. Both of Atlanta’s NHL teams have left town (the Flames went to Calgary and the Thrashers went to Winnipeg, because Canada equals hockey). The Braves have won three World Series as a franchise but only one since moving to Atlanta. The Falcons, for their part, are about to play in the second Super Bowl in franchise history, which deserves further examination.

[caption id="attachment_754792" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-754792" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Julio-Jones-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Atlanta Falcons' Julio Jones points as his competition after a great play." width="757" height="505" /> Good luck stopping Julio Jones | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-tale-of-every-super-bowl-halftime-show-since-2006.html/">Heading into Super Bowl 51</a>, the Atlanta Falcons are flying high. Quarterback Matt Ryan is playing at an MVP level; wideout Julio Jones is making opposing secondaries look silly; and the offense has put up at least 36 points in each of its two postseason games in 2016. The Falcons deserve to represent the NFC on the game's biggest stage. But they'll certainly have their work cut out for them.

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-best-quarterback-nfl-history.html/">Tom Brady</a> and the New England Patriots are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/reasons-patriots-win-super-bowl-51.html/">playing at an elite level</a> themselves, handling business on both sides of the football with relative ease. Make no mistake, they'd love nothing more than to watch Roger Goodell's face as he's forced to hand them the Lombardi Trophy. Winning this game won't erase a history of failure courtesy of Atlanta's pro sports teams. Still, it beats going 0-2 in Super Bowl appearances.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_553689" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553689 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Nascar-Crash-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="503" /> Joey Logano, driver of the #22 Shell-Pennzoil Ford; Kurt Busch, driver of the #41 Haas Automation Chevrolet; David Ragan, driver of the #34 KFC Go Cup Ford; and Michael McDowell, driver of the #95 Jordan Truck Sales Ford, crash during the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway on May 4, 2014. | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

NASCAR is one of more divisive sports out there. Some people just don't understand it -- Isn't it just a bunch of cars driving around a track in circles? What's so hard about that? On the other side of the spectrum, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/nascar-driver-reveals-how-to-lower-stress-and-relax.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some folks treat the sport like a religion</a>; it's not just driving, it's a physical grind that involves coordination, guts, and crazy endurance. There is nothing simple about that.

The fact is, whether you're someone who couldn't care less about a checkered flag or someone who makes sure to tune into as many races as popular, both sides should be able to agree that NASCAR is an incredibly dangerous sport. Every time a racer steps into a car, they are essentially putting their life on the line. Adrenaline, high speeds, risk, these are a part of every race. Unfortunately, sometimes the need for speed and the insatiable desire to win, can get the best of even the most skilled drivers. When that happens, a major wreck is not out of the question.

This sport has seen its fair share of wrecks. Yet some of these accidents have stood out among the rest as a reminder of just how dangerous getting into one of these cars can be. With that in mind, here's a look at the ten worst wrecks in NASCAR history. This list is unranked.
<h2>1. 1960 Daytona Modified Sportsman Race</h2>
The wreck at the 1960 Daytona Modified Sportsman Race holds firm in the pole position of <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/710805-nascar-crash-videos-the-13-scariest-crashes-in-nascar-history/page/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largest wrecks in NASCAR history</a>. For some reason, 73 cars started on the track that day -- on <a href="http://raceplace.zoomshare.com/album/Results%20-%20Historic%20Race%20Results/images/39fd5de9b459ad9fcc830607303d526a_13560258160/:album" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday, February 13th</a> -- and it took only one lap for 37 of them to be knocked out of commission. Eight drivers were taken to the hospital that day, but there were no fatalities or life-threatening injuries. While nothing good ever comes from a crash of this magnitude, it at least forced NASCAR to reduce the number of <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/4280752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers allowed on the track</a> at one time to 43. It's safe to say, things could have been a whole lot worse.

<h2>2. Michael Waltrip — Bristol, 1990; Mike Harmon — Bristol, 2002</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553695" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553695" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Michael-Waltrip-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="504" /> The car of Michael Waltrip, driver of the #55 NAPA Auto Parts Toyota, catches fire after he crashed into the wall during the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Sharp Aquos 500. | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

You can't talk about Bristol Motor Speedway without acknowledging <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/shake-and-bake/bristol-flashback-thunder-valley-has-seen-two-of-nascars-most-terrifying-crashes-031414" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two of the most famous crashes</a> in NASCAR History.

This first occurred in 1990 -- during the Budweiser 250 NASCAR Nationwide Series race -- when Michael Waltrip (pictured above) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzxcuV5rmA4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sent his car into turn two</a>, causing an impact so great that it practically tore his car in half. Waltrip walked away from the incident with nothing more than "some contusions and a little bit of confusion." His older brother Darrell, however, couldn't believe his brother walked away at all.

Just 12 years later in 2002, while practicing in his NASCAR Nationwide Series car, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuzCc0hBKYE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Harmon crashed</a> into turn 2 as well. His car essentially disintegrated on impact, although he also walked away unscathed. Two drivers, two separate wrecks into the same gate, and two lucky tales of survival. New rule: Always respect Bristol Motor Speedway.

<h2>3. Richard Petty — 1970</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553696" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553696 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Richard-Perry-David-Taylor-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="504" /> Richard Petty looks on during the NASCAR Savemart 300. | David Taylor/Getty Images[/caption]

Well-loved NASCAR driver Richard Petty may have been notorious for <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/vintage-speed/4280752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrecking his vehicle</a>, but none of his crashes proved scarier than the one he had in <a href="http://www.streetlegaltv.com/news/video-richard-petty-flips-at-darlington-during-the-1970-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1970 at South Carolina's Darlington Speedway</a>. Petty hit the retaining wall with his Plymouth Roadrunner and proceeded to roll and flip multiple times. It was a brutal crash that had many fans assuming the worst.

As a result of this scary event, NASCAR ordered that protective nets be installed in all NASCAR racing vehicles. The crash was also a precursor to the creation of head and neck support safety features being installed in all cars, as none existed before that time. Once again, something good came out of something that had the potential to be so bad.

<h2>4. Dale Earnhardt’s fatal NASCAR wreck</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553697" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553697 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Dale-Earnhardt-Jr.-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="496" /> Dale Earnhardt looking on during practice for the Food City 500 of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

The sport of NASCAR suffered the lost of one of it's most popular and iconic figures on February 18, 2001, when legendary driver Dale Earnhardt <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/nascar-loses-earnhardt-killed-daytona-lap-article-1.2017446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatally crashed during the final lap</a> of the 2001 Daytona 500.

It all started when Sterling Marlin’s Dodge hit the rear bumper of Earnhardt’s car and sent him spinning into the middle of the track. Ken Schrader was unable to veer around the car and hit Earnhardt’s passenger side door head on, sending him smashing into the wall at 155 miles per hour and then pushing the vehicle down the track.

Following the news of his passing, NASCAR president Mike Helton said, "This is understandably the toughest announcement I've ever had to make. We've lost Dale Earnhardt."

<h2>5. Carlos Pardo’s fatal wreck — NASCAR Corona Series, 2009</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553698" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553698" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Nascar-Jose-Castañares-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="502" /> Firemen work in the car in which Mexican Nascar driver Carlos Pardo had an accident on June 14, 2009 in Amozoc, Puebla state, Mexico. | Jose Castañares/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.autoevolution.com/news/nascar-driver-carlos-pardo-dies-in-tragic-race-crash-7763.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carlos Pardo</a> managed to win eight of the 74 NASCAR Corona Series races he participated. Unfortunately, his final victory came at a steep cost: his life.

In 2009, during the Mexico Series race at Puebla, Pardo was on Lap 97, when his car was tapped from behind, causing him to spin out of control and smash into a wall behind the pit lane at 120 miles per hour. His car was obliterated and he had to be <a href="http://www.totalprosports.com/2009/06/16/carlos-pardo-wins-nascar-race-dies-in-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airlifted to the hospital.</a> While Pardo was awarded the win because his car was out in front at the time of the crash, that detail doesn't make this incident any less tragic.

<h2>6. Steve Park — Darlington, 2001</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553699" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553699" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Steve-Park-Jon-FerreyGetty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="506" /> Steve Park driver of the #1 Pennzoil Chevrolet during the NASCAR Winston Cup Aaron's 499 | Jon Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

At Darlington Raceway in 2001, Steve Park experienced one of the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=smith_marty&amp;id=5707624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most freakish accidents</a> in NASCAR history. As the drivers drove around the track under caution, Larry Foyt raced to catch up to the rest of the vehicles, when Park accidentally pulled his steering wheel off, causing his vehicle to veer left across the track, where he would eventually be he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_tBP6V9uu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-boned by Foyt's car</a>.

Park suffered serious injuries in the accident, which included massive brain damage and a permanent speech impediment. While it was a long road to recovery, Park <a href="http://www.stockcarracing.com/thehistoryof/90598_steve_park_story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never lost his determination</a>.

<h2>7. Carl Edwards — Aaron’s 499, 2009</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553700" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553700 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Carl-Edwards-Jonathan-Moore-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="503" /> Carl Edwards, driver of the #99 Kellogg's/Frosted Flakes Ford, celebrates with a backflip after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Food City 500. | Jonathan Moore/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2009, <a href="http://www.nascar.com/en_us/drivers/carl-edwards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl Edwards</a>' No. 99 car <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=4103113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caused major damage</a> during the Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. While trying to block Brad Keselowski from passing him, Edwards' vehicle went airborne and slammed into the catch fence on the frontstretch. Despite how bad the crash looked, fortunately, no one was seriously injured in the incident.

<h2>8. Ricky Rudd — Atlanta, 1990</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553701" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553701 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Ricky-Rudd-Todd-Warshaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="504" /> Ricky Rudd, driver of the #88 Snickers Ford, spins out as Bobby Labonte, driver of the #43 Cheerios Dodge, crashes into him, during the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Auto Club 500 at California Speedway. | Todd Warshaw/Getty Images[/caption]

During the 1990 Atlanta Journal 500 -- the final race of the year -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CdSoJYFJj4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tragedy struck in pit road</a>, as Ricky Rudd lost control of his car and spun into Bill Elliott's vehicle, which was undergoing a tire change. At the time of the incident, Mike Rich -- Elliott's rear tire changer -- was working on the back tire, when <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/blog/from_the_marbles/post/The-10-most-controversial-wrecks-in-NASCAR-histo?urn=nascar-144788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he was struck and pinned between the two cars</a>. His death would prompt NASCAR to alter the speed limits in pit road and require all pit crew to wear protective gear.
<h2>9. Bill Elliott — 1987 Winston 500</h2>
The <a href="http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/7874497/nascar-talladega-87-changed-sport-forever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wreck at the 1987 Winston 500</a> at Alabama's Talladega Speedway was another crash that forced NASCAR to reevaluate its rules and regulations. This time, the problem at hand was speed.

Racers knew things were going to be fast after Bill Elliott drove his Thunderbird 212.809 miles per hour during qualifying on April 30. Therefore, when the race took place on May 3, drivers prepared themselves for an all out, wide open affair.

It was during the actual race that Bobby Allison (going close to 200 miles per hour) shredded a wheel on his Buick and spun around backwards before flying up and over the retaining wall, his car slamming back down and getting annihilated by several other race cars. While Allison was uninjured, multiple fans were hit by debris and had to be rushed to the hospital with minor injuries.

As a result of this incident, NASCAR required Daytona and Talladega-ready vehicles to install “restrictor plates” beneath beneath the carburetors, which would choke the speed of each vehicle to a less dangerous number.

<h2>10. Glenn “Fireball” Roberts — 1964 World 600</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553702" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553702 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Nascar-Wreck-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="10 Worst Car Accidents in NASCAR History" width="757" height="502" /> Bill Elliott #94 McDonald's Ford crashes on lap 141 as Bobby Labonte #18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac takes the lead. | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

Just seven laps into the <a href="http://www.stockcarracing.com/featurestories/scrp_0411_nascar_history_1964_racing_tradegies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1964 World 600 at the Charlotte Speedway</a>, popular NASCAR driver Glenn "Fireball" Roberts couldn't avoid the wreckage caused by the crash of Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson. As a result, Roberts slammed into the wall, where his car rolled over and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh5zAPMxnSU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burst into flames</a>. The incident left him with burns over 80% of his body, forcing him to be airlifted to a nearby hospital. After fighting to recover, Roberts developed pneumonia, fell into a coma, and unfortunately passed on July 2, 1964.

The tragic affair forced NASCAR to require all drivers to wear fire retardant clothing, while also installing in-vehicle fire extinguishing systems and replacing the steel tanks with rubber ones.

		<description><![CDATA[It shouldn't be surprising that President Donald Trump likes sports, given his competitive nature. Here's a look at 5 of his favorite teams.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_649364" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-649364" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Donald-Trump-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images-for-PGA-of-America.jpg" alt="Donald Trump speaks to the media about a partnership with the PGA.

There are numerous connections between Donald Trump and the world of sports. There are the athletes who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-publicly-supported-donald-trump.html/">supported his presidential bid</a>, and there are even instances of his unrivaled ability to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/donald-trump-takes-over-7-funny-nfl-team-logos.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take over NFL logos</a>. But more importantly, there's also his undeniable love for competition. Which is what we'd expect from a true fan.

The President of the United States likes plenty of pro sports teams. However, after doing a little digging, we've found that he prefers some clubs to others. Since we're sure you're dying to know which organizations get The Donald's blood boiling, we're happy to oblige, by taking a look at five of Trump's favorite sports teams.

<h2>1. New York Yankees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_649344" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-649344" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Donald-Trump-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="Donald Trump (R) chats with Amar'e Stoudemire before the start of a Yankees game. " width="757" height="527" /> Donald Trump (R) chats with Amar'e Stoudemire before the start of a Yankees game. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

It'd be easy to suggest that The Donald is only a fan of the Bronx Bombers because former Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neil -- among <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-publicly-supported-donald-trump.html/">other athletes</a> -- <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/yankee-outfielder-paul-o-neill-endorses-donald-trump-article-1.2557732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsed him for president</a>, but that's not the case at all. His love for the team goes much deeper than that. It's a love that, dare we say, is "Yuge."

[caption id="attachment_780192" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-780192" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Donald-Trump-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x437.jpg" alt="Donald Trump attends a Yankees game." width="757" height="517" /> Donald Trump is a fan of the pinstripes. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

As a longtime fan of the AL East team, Trump has always enjoyed chatting <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258589709608034304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about the team in pinstripes</a>. To this day, he still <a href="http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2016/04/donald_trump_and_the_yankees_what_theyve_said_abou.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintains relationships</a> with both current and former members of the organization. Of course, if The Donald had things his way, he wouldn't just be a fan of the Yankees, <a href="http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/11/02/donald-trump-colin-cowherd-own-yankees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he'd own them</a>.

<h2>2. New York Mets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_649351" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-649351" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Donald-Trump-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Donald Trump attends the Mets game on Opening Day. " width="757" height="505" /> Donald Trump attends the Mets game on Opening Day. | Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Trump's heart may belong to the Yankees, but that doesn't mean he can't show some love to the New York Mets, as evidenced by his attendance at the team's Opening Day game in 2012. Still, it's one thing to go to the game, it's a completely different thing to put your money where you mouth is -- and that is what separates The Donald from being just an average fan.

Back in 2011, when it looked as if the Madoff case could derail the New York Mets, Trump talked about stepping in and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/sports/baseball/16wilpon.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bailing out the club</a> -- by buying them. As only a person like Trump could put it: “The Wilpons are friends of mine, and I really hope it works out great for them. But if anything doesn’t work out for them, I’d be interested in the team.” Talk about bringing a whole new meaning to the idea of making the Mets "great again."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SaHW6Y7_Yg"></iframe>

There is no real evidence to suggest that Trump is a Philadelphia 76ers fan. In fact, given his <a href="http://www.csnphilly.com/the700level/ed-snider-once-kicked-donald-trump-out-his-suite-talking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">past experience with the Flyers</a>, it might be safe to assume the opposite. Yet, after watching the above interview with Sacha Baron Cohen's "Ali G," we can't help but think he has a soft spot for the team.

Call us crazy, but we believe the Allen Iverson jersey acted as a calming mechanism. We really do. In fact, the way we see it, the answer to dealing with the real estate mogul's usual brashness is simple: It's The Answer. Thank you, A.I. -- you never cease to amaze us.

<h2>4. Buffalo Bills</h2>

Although it didn't work out in his favor, Trump was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10785589/donald-trump-interested-buying-buffalo-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serious about buying the Buffalo Bills</a>. We're not saying this would've been the best thing for a fanbase that is already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-american-cities-with-the-most-miserable-sports-fans.html/">used to suffering</a>, but at least he wouldn't have tried to move the team (or so he says).

"I'm going to give it a heavy shot," Trump told the News back in 2014. "I would love to do it, and if I can do it, I'm keeping it in Buffalo." Do you feel that passion? We most certainly do. At least he was a good sport when things didn't go his way -- <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/10/donald-trump-is-incredibly-salty-about-not-being-the-owner-of-the-buffalo-bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said no one ever</a>. Classic Donald.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. New Jersey Generals</h2>

In case you were unaware, in 1983, Trump <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13255737/five-things-know-donald-trump-usfl-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bought a football team</a> -- the New Jersey Generals. Never heard of them? Of course you haven't; they were part of the United States Football League (USFL). Never heard of that either? No surprise there, the league folded in 1985. How is that even possible, you ask? Two words: The Donald.

Instead of accepting that the USFL would play its games in the spring, Trump pushed the league to move the games to the fall and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/20/sports/football/donald-trumps-less-than-artful-failure-in-pro-football.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go head-to-head with the NFL</a>. Why anyone in their right mind would think this was a good idea is beyond us. But it happened, and it was an unmitigated disaster. Good times. We're serious, it was the best -- bigly.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_540229" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-540229" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NHL-Fight-Bruce-Bennett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="An official breaks up one of the worst NHL fights." width="757" height="504" /> An official breaks up one of the worst NHL fights | Bruce Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

It's simple. In hockey, there is no better sign of a tense game or bitter rivalry than when players drop their gloves <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/slideshows/craziest-fights-nhl-history/">and a fight breaks out</a>. Slap shot goals are great, and a spastic goalie save will certainly make fans' jaws fall to the floor. But when a crucial win is on the line against a terrible foe, tempers are sure to flair and punches will surely be thrown. The non-fight crowd can't even deny it; there is nothing in hockey quite like when players start throwing haymakers.

The NHL regular season has its fair share of engaging fights (ahem, this season's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULvRPN0rDY">full line brawl</a> between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Vancouver Canucks). But the most intense fisticuffs are the ones that take place in the playoffs, as teams engage in the battle for Lord Stanley's Mug. With the stakes so high and the pressure so great, the hits <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-surprises-so-far-this-nhl-season.html/">will surely be harder</a> and the chances of a smackdown will escalate. Naturally, a select few playoff scraps top the rest.

The NHL has cracked down on fighting in recent years, making the role of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nhl-trades-of-all-time.html/">fight instigator</a> a more serious offense. Which, of course, makes these moments in league history even more incredible. Here is a look at the best NFL fights and brawls in playoff history.
<h2><!--nextpage--> 8. Philadelphia Flyers vs. Pittsburgh Penguins <span class="s1">–</span> April 15, 2012</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcvzqBdCqH0"></iframe>
The 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs featured a whole slough of big brawls. And with bitter rivals Pittsburgh and Philadelphia facing off, it was only a matter of time before a massive fight broke out. Pittsburgh had a 7-4 in the third frame of Game 3 in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals when then-Penguin James Neal laid a dirty hit on Philly's Sean Couturier. The hit ignited a fiery mess of flying fists that peppered the last few minutes of the already-contentious tilt.
<h2><!--nextpage--> 7. Chicago Blackhawks vs. Phoenix Coyotes <span class="s1">–</span> April 17, 2012</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2mX7LqBGo4"></iframe>
Sometimes a big brawl erupts when a player lays down a nasty hit, and the opposing team takes him on. And nobody can have a discussion about nasty NHL fights without talking about Raffi Torres. He did, after all, make league history when <a href="http://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/the_long_road_back_to_the_nhl_continues_for_raffi_torres/s1_13132_20259679">the NHL handed him a 41-game suspension in 2015</a>.

Torres made his mark on the playoffs fight reel when he laid a brutal blindsided hit on Chicago's Marian Hossa. As the Blackhawk' winger rolled on the ice in pain, his teammates dog-piled on top of Torres. Officials halted play as they battled to pull players off the heap. The fight concluded, but the hit earned Torres a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/coyotes-torres-suspended-25-games-for-hossa-hit/c-629008">25-game suspension</a> that kept him out of the rest of the playoffs. A couple years later, while playing for the San Jose Sharks, he exited the playoffs early again for a hit on LA Kings' Jarrett Stoll.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. St. Louis Blues vs. San Jose Sharks <span class="s1">–</span> April 14, 2012</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dN0kF_zif8"></iframe>
The Sharks and Blues have played each other tough for several years. The atmosphere typically indicates that a fight is on the horizon. During the 2012 playoffs, those bad feelings bubbled over like overheated soup on the stove.

St. Louis had just shut Team Teal out 3-0 in the second game of the series to knot things up at a game a piece. A frustrated Sharks team took their frustration out on the Blues after the final buzzer sounded. Sharks' defenseman Douglas Murray, who was common fighter, led the charge off to the side of San Jose's goal, and multiple players jumped into the dog pile of a brawl that the refs struggled to stop.

Sharks defenseman Justin Braun, who to this day is <em>not</em> a common fighter, exchanged punches with Blues' d-man Roman Polak. The <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/nhl/post/_/id/42244/former-foes-roman-polak-justin-braun-now-san-jose-sharks-teammates">two played together four seasons later</a> when the Sharks picked up Polak ahead of their 2016 payoff run. San Jose won the Western Conference that season, defeating -- drumroll, please -- St. Louis.

<h2>5. Chicago Blackhawks vs. St. Louis Blues <span class="s1">–</span> April 19, 2014</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFCiYri04Oo"></iframe>
No matter what professional sport you look at, teams from Chicago and St. Louis don't play nice. So of course, the Blackhawks and the Blues -- two franchises that put a heavy-hitting product on the ice in recent history -- don't particularly like each other.

The whole debacle in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs started with Chicago's Brent Seabrook laying a massive hit on then-Blues forward David Backes. The hit knocked Backes out for a couple seconds, and his Blues teammates charged after the Blackhawks in his defense. Backes picked himself up and attempted to join the scrap, but he was clearly still in a daze and unable to fully keep his skates under him. Seabrook was ejected from the game, and later "hit" with a three-game suspension.

<h2>4. St. Louis Blues vs. Detroit Red Wings – April 12, 1991</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qe0ZOwkUx1g"></iframe>
The story goes that the St. Louis Blues were down 3-1 against the Detroit Red Wings in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs. They eventually rallied to win the series and become just the eighth team to win after being down 3-1 in the series, per <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=31154#1" target="_blank">NHL.com</a>. But that’s not why most folks remember this series. Most fans remember this series for the April 4, 1991 massacre.

In summary: 298 penalty minutes. Multiple ejections. An escalating brew of fisticuffs and five straight minutes of footage of players punching each other in the face and others trying to stop them, with varying degrees of failure.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Boston Bruins vs. New York Islanders – April 17, 1980</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J56hXfkMM4M"></iframe>
This exchange of unpleasantries was during the second game of the quarterfinals in the 1980 NHL playoffs, which the Islanders would win, 4-1, over the hapless Bruins. For fans of silver linings, though, there’s the fact that Terry O’Reilly definitely won this fight (although the Boston squad lost the game, 5-4, in overtime).

While the two players had three more evenly matched NHL fights over the course of the series, we must side with the DropYourGloves.com reviewers, who universally <a href="http://dropyourgloves.com/fights/GameEvents.aspx?Game=14642" target="_blank">give the W to O’Reilly</a>, describing the scene as, “A<span id="GameEvents"><span class="V10b"> fiery, feisty, fight between these two tough guys,</span></span>” and “T<span id="GameEvents"><span class="V10b">he first of their classic playoff tilts.</span></span>” One also suggests that O’Reilly falls down “as usual,” because that quickly becomes a thing with him.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Boston Bruins vs. Montreal Canadiens – May 21, 1978</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ne1y0QCOQOM"></iframe>
The Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens still hold claim to one of the fiercest NHL rivalries. The two teams have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO4XPedB9mA" target="_blank">incited riots since 1955</a>. For the past 60 years, they've exuded enmity that goes well beyond the standard fare of sports animosity, which is typically more for the fans than the actual players involved.

Arguably the best fight between the two happened all the way back in 1978, in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals. It featured Pierre Bouchard and Stan Johnathan. In the words of a user on <a href="http://dropyourgloves.com/fights/GameEvents.aspx?Game=14750#Fight22665" target="_blank">DropYourGloves.com</a>, “<span id="GameEvents"><span class="V10b">Both fighters, by the way, should be lauded for standing up like men and trading fire in a mano-a-mano, let’s-settle-this-thing manner; no post-’eighties hug-and-duck tactics here!” It’s pretty intense, that’s for sure. Check out the entire fight above.</span></span>

<h2>1. Philadelphia Flyers vs. Montreal Canadiens – May 14, 1987</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6YX5vFUTeQ"></iframe>
This isn't just the biggest fight in NHL playoffs history; it is a top moment in the history of the league. Part of the beauty is that both teams were so heavily involved. But most of the wonder comes from the fact that this massive 10-plus minute brawl took place before the tilt even started.

The whole debacle ensued at the end of pregame warmups, with most of the players already heading to their respective dressing rooms. Legendary Habs' forward Claude Lemieux attempted to cap off his warmup the same way he did many others, by shooting a puck into the Flyers' empty net. The gesture didn't sit well with Philadelphia's Ed Hospodar and Chico Resch, and Hospodar showed his dislike with his mitts. The chaotic fight pulled both teams out of their dressing rooms to join in on the team-on-team massacre.

Two things stick out most about this epic bout: First, half of the players involved aren't in full uniform, creating an odd spectacle of exposed hockey pads. But most famously, this brawl is a league highlight because the officials gave out no penalties, since the fight occurred before opening puck drop.

It's only fair to wonder how this brawl would have played out in the current league. With that in mind...
<h2><!--nextpage-->As previously mentioned, the rules for fighting have changed</h2>

More than likely, people would look at a pregame brawl, like the one between Montreal and Philadelphia, a bit differently nowadays. The NHL first made an effort to curb fighting in the early '90s, with the "Instigator Rule" taking the form we know today. Even with the aforementioned playoff instances, violence in the league has notably decreased in the last 20-plus years.

With the growing knowledge of concussions, the league now takes a more serious look at hits to the head. Many in-game officials don't let many NHL fights come to fruition, breaking players up the second they start jawing at each other.

		<description><![CDATA[Retirement can be rough for athletes who can't adjust. Which professional sports league in the U.S. provides its players with the best retirement benefits?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_785656" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785656 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Roger-Goodell_DeMaurice-Smith.jpg" alt="Michael Loccisano/Getty Images" width="757" height="531" /> Michael Loccisano/Getty Images[/caption]

It is not uncommon to see professional athletes spending <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-couldnt-stay-retired.html/">their post-playing days</a> living paycheck to paycheck or <a title="Why Athletes Go Broke" href="http://www.si.com/vault/2009/03/23/105789480/how-and-why-athletes-go-broke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going flat-out broke</a>. Many athletes run into major financial troubles due to the significant window of time between their last paycheck as a professional athlete and their first retirement paycheck. People often blame the athletes’ employers – their former teams – for their financial shortcomings, but in reality, it happens in large part due to a lack of saving, frivolous spending, and bad investment decisions on the players’ end.

One of the less heralded perks of being a professional athlete are the <a title="Retirement Plans For Pro Athletes" href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2012/09/25/go-long-retirement-plans-for-pro-athletes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retirement benefits</a> made available to them by the professional sports leagues, and their member teams, in the United States. The plans range from simple 401(k) match programs, to annuities, to performance-based pension funds, and all are very generous.

Many of the retirement plans offered by the leagues across the country have greatly improved over the last 10 years as new and approved collective bargaining agreements have been ratified. So, which American sports league offers its players the best retirement benefits? Here is a look at how the retirement plans of the six biggest American professional sports entities compare to one another.

<h2>1. Major League Soccer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_785543" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-785543" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MLS.jpg" alt="Jewel Samad/Getty Images" width="757" height="946" /> Jewel Samad/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> 401(k)
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span> $60,000

The MLS implemented the first retirement plan in league history in 2004. The plan offers an elective 401(k) vested immediately and allows players to contribute anything up to the maximum amount defined by the Internal Revenue Service, which is $18,000 in 2015. The plan also offers an employer match of 3.5% up to the IRS limit.

<h2>2. National Hockey League</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> Pension
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span> $550,000

As a part of the <a title="NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement" href="http://cdn.agilitycms.com/nhlpacom/PDF/NHL_NHLPA_2013_CBA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collective bargaining agreement</a> between the NHL and the NHL Players Association that was agreed upon in January 2013, eligible players are now able to <a title="NHL Pension Plan Was Vital in CBA Talks" href="http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/johnston-on-nhl-pension-plan-was-vital-in-cba-talks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive a generous pension benefit when they retire</a>.

Instead of the defined contribution plan in place since 1986, players now enjoy the added benefit of a defined benefit pension plan waiting for them in retirement. The new plan is based on the amount of service time players accumulate over the course of the CBA, and has a maximum yearly value of $255,000.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> Pension
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span> Varies based on each player’s individual performance.

The PGA has one of the <a title="A Tour Pro's Nest Egg" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2005-11-13/a-tour-pros-nest-egg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most generous pension plans</a> in all of professional sports. Golfers receive money in their pension accounts based on the number of cuts they make, their performance in each of the three schedule segments during the season, and their position on the end of season money list.

To be fully vested for the cuts-made portion of the plan, players must play in 15 or more tour events for five seasons. To be fully vested in the three segments portion of the plan, players have to either play in 100 official tour events in four years, or play each event on tour once over a four-year period. Lastly, the money earned for position on the end of season money list is fully vested immediately. Many golfers will have <a title="PGA Pensions Are the Richest in Sports" href="http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news01/pensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well over $10 million in their pension accounts</a> by the time they retire.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> Pension, 401(k)
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span>  $507,336

NBA players are eligible to participate in the league’s pension plan, and become fully vested after three years of service in the NBA. Players can begin drawing from their pensions at age 50, but stand to benefit greatly if they hold off until they turn 62 years old. For players who choose to collect at 50 years old, the minimum yearly benefit is $19,160, and the maximum yearly benefit – for players with 10 or more years in the league – is $60,000 per year. If a player waits until his 62nd birthday to collect, their minimum yearly benefit would be $60,000 and their maximum yearly benefit would be $200,000.

The NBA also has an elective 401(k) available to players with a employer matching program that allows the league’s contributions to <a title="NBA Retirement Plan" href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2013/10/29/7-best-worst-retirement-plans-in-pro-sports?page=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly exceed player contributions</a>.

<h2>5. Major League Baseball</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> Pension
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span>  $507,500

Originally established in 1947, the MLB pension plan involves players getting fully vested after only 43 games. Players receive full pension benefits — $200,000 per year at the age of 62 — with 10 or more seasons of service. Players with less than 10 seasons of service still receive generous benefits. And as a joint-survivor plan, the spouses of vested players can receive benefits if their husbands pass away.

<h2>6. National Football League</h2>
<img class="wp-image-630386" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NFL-Draft_Richard-Schultz_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Retirement plan:</span> Pension, 401(k), Annuity
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Minimum salary in 2015:</span> $435,000

The NFL bases their pension plan on credited seasons. Players become fully vested and eligible for benefits once they participate in three credited seasons in the league. At 55 years old, they can begin collecting. The NFL bases a player’s monthly benefit on the number of credited seasons they achieve, and the time period of said seasons. Players will receive $660 per credited season every month for the 2015-2017 seasons, and $760 per credited season every month for the 2018-2020 seasons.

The NFL’s 401(k) program, which is otherwise known as the Second Career Savings Plan, offers players a 2:1 match up to $26,000 once players have two credited seasons in the NFL.

The last retirement benefit available to NFL players is an annuity plan. Once players have four credited seasons, the league will contribute $80,000 per credited season from 2014-2017, and $95,000 per credited season from 2018-2020. Players can begin collecting this benefit once they reach 35-years-old.

Full details of the NFL’s retirement plan can be found in the league’s <a title="NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement" href="https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/collective-bargaining-agreement-2011-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collective Bargaining Agreement</a>.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_815419" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-815419 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Phil-Mickelson-and-Jim-Mackay-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-e1434751300370.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="532" /> Phil Mickelson (L) and caddie Jim Mackay talk at The Honda Classic | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

It wasn’t too long ago that we were discussing how <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-highest-paid-golfers-in-2015.html" target="_blank">well it paid</a> to be among the top players on the PGA tour. However, if you think that these individuals are the only ones making a killing from their quality play on the course, you may want to reconsider your position. While golfers do manage to bring in the big bucks, their caddies are also collecting their fair share of the winnings -- and then some.

When Forbes crunched the numbers, it found that, in 2014, at least <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/19/golf-highest-paid-caddies-on-the-pga-tour/#5c27f6c46635" target="_blank">10 caddies on tour earned at least $600,000</a>. While discussing the matter with James Edmonson -- president of the Association of Professional Tour Caddies -- it <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/19/golfs-highest-paid-caddies-on-the-pga-tour/" target="_blank">was revealed</a> that most of the established golfers on tour will pay their caddies roughly 8% of their winnings and 10% for a win. On top of that, caddies can also earn extra money if they have their own endorsement deals. And as you probably expected, the ones with the greater exposure tend to do better than the rest.

The golfer may be the one hitting the ball, but caddies are more than just bag holders. They help the pro read the course, analyze the breaks, and are there to provide the necessary advice and guidance. As a result, they get paid accordingly. Using the information provided by Edmonson, Forbes set out to determine which of these confidants earned top-dollar (during the 2014 season). With that in mind, here's a look at the 5 highest-paid caddies on the planet.

<h2>5. Mark Fulcher</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709283" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709283" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mark-Fulcher-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="504" /> Justin Rose of Great Britain celebrates with caddie Mark Fulcher after winning in the final round of men's golf on Day 9 of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $720,000</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Player</span>: Justin Rose</li>
</ul>
</div>
The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdjge/5-mark-fulcher/" target="_blank">image used</a> by Forbes for the No. 5 position on the highest-paid caddies list is correct, but the pro golfer associated with caddie Mark Fulcher is not. Still, given that Fulcher loops for Justin Rose, it’s not surprising that he made $720,000 in 2014. Rose is currently the <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.22405.html" target="_blank">10th-rated golfer in the world</a> and a consistent top-10 finisher on tour. As long as Fulcher remains on Rose’s bag, you can expect him to have a steady and solid bank account.

<h2>4. Gareth Lord</h2>
[caption id="attachment_815358" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-815358 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Henrik-Stenson-and-Gareth-Lord-Harry-How-Getty-Images-e1434746191333.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="488" /> Henrik Stenson (R) and Gareth Lord at the U.S. Open | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $725,000</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Player</span>: Henrik Stenson</li>
</ul>
</div>
Henrik Stenson is the <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.21528.html" target="_blank">No. 6 golfer in the world</a> and, as a result, his caddie Gareth Lord has made a fine living for himself. According to Forbes, Lord raked in $725,000 in 2014. However, while this is a solid haul, it falls a bit short of his income from 2013, when Stenson won the FedEx cup. As the victor of that cup, Stenson took home a bonus of $10 million and gave Lord a 10% cut. For a job well done, Lord decided to buy himself a Ferrari. You might think that’s a bit excessive, but we have no doubt he worked hard for it.

<h2>3. Ted Scott</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709284" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709284" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ted-Scott-Andrew-Redington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="486" /> Bubba Watson and his caddie Ted Scott celebrate on the first play-off hole as he wins the WGC - HSBC Champions | Andrew Redington/Getty Images[/caption]

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $900,000</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Player</span>: Bubba Watson</li>
</ul>
</div>
The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdjge/3-ted-scott/" target="_blank">third-highest paid caddy</a> on the tour is Ted Scott -- Bubba Watson’s trusted confidante since 2006 -- who pulled in $900,000 in 2014. Watson is currently the<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/golf/rankings" target="_blank"> fourth-ranked golfer</a> in the world and well-known for his crushing shots off the tee. In the time that Scott has been on Watson’s bag, he has won plenty of big tournaments; mostly notably, The Masters in 2012 and 2014. There’s no doubt that Scott takes pleasure in helping Watson achieve great things. As <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/19/golfs-highest-paid-caddies-on-the-pga-tour/" target="_blank">Forbes noted</a>, if you were to ask this caddy to define his job, his response would be: “My job is to help Bubba play his best golf." We’d say he’s pretty good at his job.

<h2>2. J.P. Fitzgerald</h2>
[caption id="attachment_815364" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-815364 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rory-McIlroy-and-J.P.-Fitzgerald-e1434746639466.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="509" /> Rory McIlroy (R) and J.P.

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $1.48 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Player</span>: Rory McIlroy</li>
</ul>
</div>
J.P Fitzgerald has been Rory McIlroy’s caddy since 1998, long before the 26-year-old from Northern Ireland blossomed into <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.28237.html" target="_blank">No. 3-ranked player in the world</a>. So when McIlroy began to take the tour by force, Fitzgerald was right there going along for the ride. Together they’ve made for quite a team and in the process, Fitzgerald managed to bank $1.48 million in 2014. If you think about how well McIlroy is doing both <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-highest-paid-golfers-in-2015.html/4/" target="_blank">on and off the course</a>, it’s fair to assume that Fitzgerald will continue to be taken care of for his hard work.

<h2>1. Micah Fugitt</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709285" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709285" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Micah-Fugitt-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Highest-Paid Caddies on the Planet" width="757" height="445" /> Billy Horschel of the United States celebrates on the 18th green with his caddie Micah Fugitt after his two-stroke victory at the BMW Championship at the Cherry Hills Country Club on September 7, 2014 | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Earnings</span>: $1.57 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Player</span>: Billy Horschel</li>
</ul>
When Billy Horschel won the <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/fedexcup/winners/2014champion_billyhorschel.html" target="_blank">2014 FedEx Cup</a>, his wallet instantly got a lot fatter. That’s what happens when you receive a victory bonus of $10 million. But he wasn’t the only individual to come away with a big payday. With his 10% share, Micah Fugitt was now $1 million richer and well on his way to becoming the world’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdjge/1-micah-fugitt/" target="_blank">highest-paid caddy</a>, with a grand total of $1.57 million. This just goes to show, you don’t need to be the one swinging the club to reap the reward.

		<description><![CDATA[It's been 25 years since Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in one of the biggest upsets in sports history. What other great upsets still live on today?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euZ08eWV4ME"></iframe>

It’s been over 25 years since James “Buster" Douglas <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/buster-douglas-belief-led-him-stunning-upset-tyson-212854497--spt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did the impossible</a> and knocked out Mike Tyson, but people are still talking about it. It was such a major event, that folks can even remember where they were <a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/page/blackhistoryBOX1/the-day-james-buster-douglas-shook-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when it happened</a>. That’s the power of this moment. That’s the power of any moment where the unfathomable occurs, why there’s so much beauty in the upset.

In every match there is a favorite, and there is an underdog. One team is supposed to come out on top, and one team is merely a stepping stone to the other’s inevitable victory. But sometimes, the stars align, and David puts it all together and topples Goliath. That’s what went down 25 years ago when Tyson hit the mat. And Buster Douglas gave us that moment.

This was unquestionably one of the biggest upsets the world of sports has ever witnessed. And there have been some amazing ones. Here are the five we believe represent the greatest of all time.

<h2>1. David Tyree (helmet) catches the Patriots off guard</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/27XeNefwABw"></iframe>

Super Bowl XLII was supposed to be the night that the New England Patriots capped off a perfect 19-0 season. But in the end, it was the New York Giants who found themselves celebrating under the falling confetti. Quarterback Eli Manning was the MVP who drove the Giants to a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=280203017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17-14 upset victory</a>, but this night will always be remembered for David Tyree and his improbable “helmet catch."

<h2>2. Jets beat the Colts in Super Bowl III</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmHEILo48K8"></iframe>

There was no one picking the New York Jets from the AFL to defeat the NFL’s Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. No one except Jets quarterback Joe Namath. In fact, he guaranteed it. And on Sunday, January 12, 1969, Broadway Joe proved to be a man of his word, as he led the Jets to a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196901120clt.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">16-7 upset</a> against the heavily favored Colts.

<h2> 3. Rulon Gardner defeats Alexander Karelin</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaPx7DbdBUo"></iframe>

American Rulon Gardner was about to face the greatest obstacle of his life at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. It was the gold medal match in Greco Roman wrestling, and he was set to face three-time defending Olympic champion, Alexander Karelin. This guy was considered unbeatable. In fact, he hadn’t lost an international match in 13 years; he didn’t even concede a point in the last 10. But somehow Gardner got up 1-0, and <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/89" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed to hold onto</a> that lead for the rest of the match. This victory is easily one of the greatest upsets in sports history.

<h2> 4. Wildcats topple the Hoyas</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGrzYe9qP7g"></iframe>

Going into the 1985 NCAA Championship game, Patrick Ewing and the Georgetown Hoyas were the baddest team in all the land. They were riding a 17-game winning streak and looking to win back-to-back national titles. Everyone believed they’d be cutting down the nets at the end of the night. Unfortunately, the eighth-seeded Villanova Wildcats didn’t see it that way. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They came to play</a>. They came to win. And that’s exactly what they did, as they upset the Hoyas 66-64.

<h2>5. “Miracle on Ice"</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYscemhnf88"></iframe>

The <a href="http://www.ushockeyhalloffame.com/page/show/831562-the-1980-u-s-olympic-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1980 U.S. Men’s Olympic ice hockey</a> team had no business beating the Soviet Union in the medal round. The USSR was an unstoppable force that had dominated the sport for years. But Herb Brooks and his melting pot of college stars believed that they could pull of the impossible. Their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0222.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-3 upset win</a> proved it to be true. And in doing so, they had us <a href="https://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believing in miracles</a>.

<a href="http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/sports_broadcasting_calls/united_states_soviet_union_1980.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes!</a>

		<description><![CDATA[In the world of sports, ESPN's '30 for 30' series represents documentary storytelling at its finest. Here's a look at the 7 films that drew us in the most.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_620831" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Frederick-M.-Brown-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-620831" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Frederick-M.-Brown-Getty-Images-640x443.jpg" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the '30 for 30 Shorts' discussion panel | Frederick M.

For all the great sports movies out there, including the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-highest-grossing-sports-movies-in-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ones that bring in the big bucks</a>, there are plenty of stories that have no business being told. They're simply just not that good. Don't get us wrong, we love fiction as much as anyone. Yet, in the world of sports, a place where drama <em>actually</em> exists, there's really no point in trying to make up over-the-top stories. Not when we have so many <em>real</em> ones to tell.

If you're among those who don't appreciate a good sports documentary, perhaps it's time to make a change. And if you need a place to start, we highly recommend taking a look at <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN' '30 for 30' series</a>. While you're at it, give these seven films a chance. Trust us, you won't be disappointed.
<h2>7. Chasing Tyson</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRAghzaKbBI"></iframe>

&nbsp;

Imagine being one of the greatest boxers the sport had ever seen. A four-time heavyweight champion, in fact. And yet, not even achieving that level of success was enough to gain you the respect you deserved. The only way to gain said respect was to fight <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/mike-tyson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Tyson</a>. Welcome to the world of Evander Holyfield and his story told through Steven Cantor's documentary, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=chasingtyson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chasing Tyson</a></em>.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. I Hate Christian Laettner</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjW_HOrwLzM"></iframe>

It's safe to say that former Duke All-American Christian Laettner is one of the greatest college basketball players in history. And yet, there's a fairly good chance that unless you attended the university, you're probably not a fan of the two-time national champion. Why is that the case? That's what Rory Karpf's documentary, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=ihatechristianlaettner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I Hate Christian Laettner</a></em>, looks to find out.
<h2>5. Survive and Advance</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjRDgLIXpmc"></iframe>

College basketball has seen its fair share of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinderella stories</a>. Yet, none stand out quite like the magical run made by the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/north-carolina-state/1983.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1982-83 North Carolina State Wolfpack</a>. John Hook's documentary, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=survive%20and%20advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survive and Advance</a></em>, looks at this team's unlikely road to a national championship and the "one shining moment" that stood out among the rest.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. You Don't Know Bo</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMXOFrJgEo0"></iframe>

Bo Jackson's freak athleticism was something that captured the imagination of both sports fans and non-sports fans alike. Because he wasn't just a professional football and baseball player, he was a legendary figure who defied what we thought was humanely possible. In the documentary, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=you-dont-know-bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You Don't Know Bo</a></em>, director Michael Bonfiglio takes a closer look at the mythological creature that was "Bo Jackson."
<h2>3. Benji</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/68JBVkKSVJA"></iframe>

In 1984, Chicago's Ben Wilson was the top high school basketball prospect in the country. But the day before his senior season at Simeon High School, he was killed. And for his friends, family, and the city of Chicago, nothing was ever the same. In the documentary, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=benji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benji</a></em>, co-directors Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah tell a powerful story about loss and what might have been.

<h2>2. The Fab Five</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6aQe4zLN2w"></iframe>

From the moment Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson took their talents to the University of Michigan in 1991, college basketball was never the same. These five freshmen -- <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1852189/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fab Five</a> -- </em>with their confidence, baggy shorts, black socks and black sneakers, were more than just the greatest recruiting class the sport had ever seen. They were a cultural phenomenon. And with his documentary, Jason Hehir's takes you into the revolution itself.
<h2>1. The U</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1zTpPEXNGQ"></iframe>

There's nothing quite like watching the rise of a dynasty. Unless, of course, you were among the unfortunate individuals who had to contest with the Miami Hurricanes in the 1980s as they brought a new kind of swagger into the world of college football. Directed by Billy Corben and Alfred Spellman, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1199479/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The U</a></em>, looks at the rise of this program, its sensationally talented and controversial players, and as <a href="http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=the-u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corben himself notes</a>, "The team that forever changed how football was played -- and most certainly put the 'nasty' into dynasty."

It doesn't matter how you look at it, professional sports and money are greatly intertwined. So much so that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-highest-paid-athletes-in-2015.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-paid athletes in the world</a> earn a ridiculous amount of cash. Of course, if you think that's unfair, just wait until you <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-richest-american-sports-team-owners.html/">learn about the individuals who own sports franchises</a>. That's when things really get out of hand. According to Forbes, there are now 63 billionaires who own at least one team in a major sports league around the world.

In fact, these individuals -- whose net worths combine to reach $285 billion -- actually own "81 teams across seven sports and 12 leagues." If you feel a bit salty at the moment, don't worry. You're not alone. As you might expect, even when Forbes was compiling its list of "The World's Richest Sports Team Owners 2016," some names stood out among the rest; the wealthiest of the wealthy, so to speak. Therefore, we found it only natural to take a harder look at the 12 richest sports team owners on the planet.

<h2>12. Silvio Berlusconi and family</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $6.2 billion

Silvio Berlusconi is a man of many colors. He made his fortune in media, but he made headlines as the three-time prime minister found guilty of tax fraud, as well as bribing an Italian senator. Still, the guy is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/12-silvio-berlusconi/#222a4e196ccb">worth $6.2 billion</a> and owns the Italian soccer club A.C. Milan. We're sure there's a life lesson in there somewhere. Let us know if you figure it out.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $7.1 billion

When he's not earning coin as the mastermind behind Carnival Cruises, Micky Arison can enjoy all he luxuries that come with being the owner of the NBA's Miami Heat. The team may lack the talent it's had in recent years, especially with the departures of LBJ and D-Wade, but it's hard to really complain. After all, beautiful weather is beautiful weather.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $7.6 billion

Soccer fans are quite familiar with Roman Abramovich. The owner of London's Chelsea Football Club, who made his money in oil and steel, is not afraid to spend big bucks on top-tier players, so long as it produces results on the pitch. Unfortunately, Abramovich's way of doing things has led to the sacking of many a manager. Does that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-craziest-franchise-owners.html/">make him crazy</a>? We'll let you be the judge of that.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $7.6 billion

The Brooklyn Nets may be among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-worst-franchises-league-history.html/">worst teams in the NBA</a>, but that didn't stop Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov from <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2015/12/22/mikhail-prokhorov-onexim-purchases-nets-barclays-center">securing full ownership of the team and the Barclays Center</a> back in 2015. Hey, when you make your fortune in banking, metals, and other enterprises, there's nothing wrong with splurging on a professional basketball team. Plus, BK is so hot right now.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $7.7 billion

Stan Kroenke is the mastermind behind the Rams' <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/los-angeles-rams/">return to Los Angeles</a>. The guy had Hollywood dreams, and as the owner of the franchise, he found a way to make it happen. Of course, when it comes having stakes in pro sports franchises, this is hardly Kroenke's first rodeo. The real estate mogul, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/8-stanley-kroenke/#28d05fed25fc">worth $7.7 billion</a>, also owns the Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids, Denver Nuggets, and Arsenal FC of the English Premier League.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $9.5 billion

After leaving IBM in 1972, Hasso Plattner set about starting the German software company SAP. By navigating the tricky waters of the tech world, Plattner amassed an impressive worth of $9.5 billion. Part of this fortune went toward becoming the majority owner the NHL's San Jose Sharks. You see what we did there? Tricky waters, sharks -- yeah, you get it.

<h2>6. Philip Anschutz</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $9.7 billion

As the owner of the Los Angeles Kings, it's fitting that Philip Anschutz is the wealthiest team owner in the National Hockey League. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/6-philip-anschutz/#3f49955c685e">Worth $9.7 billion</a> at the time of this analysis, Anschutz made his money through a diverse array of investments, including railroads, oil, telecom, entertainment, and real estate. His interests aren't limited to the ice, as the billionaire also owns the Los Angeles Galaxy of the MLS.

</div>
The Miami Dolphins may not have the necessary talent to take down their AFC East rivals on the field, but the organization certainly has the resources to give it a shot. Thanks to his undeniable real estate acumen, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross is worth $12 billion, making him the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/5-stephen-ross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth-richest owner</a> in all of professional sports. For Dolphins fans, hopefully the hiring of new head coach Adam Gase can turn all that money into victories on the gridiron.

<h2>4. Dietrich Mateschitz</h2>
[caption id="attachment_609760" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-609760" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Daniel-Ricciardo-and-Dietrich-Mateschitz-Mark-Thompson-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Dietrich Mateschitz stands with a Red Bull Racing driver." width="757" height="505" /> Dietrich Mateschitz (R) makes big bucks with Red Bull Racing | Mark Thompson/Getty Images[/caption]

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $13.2 billion

</div>
It's not everyday that you see a correlation between auto racing and soccer, however, that changes when you turn your attention to a man who plays a monumental role in both worlds: Dietrich Mateschitz, the founder of Red Bull. According to Forbes, as the owner of both Red Bull Racing and the New York Red Bulls, Mateschitz has amassed a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/4-dietrich-mateschitz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net worth of $13.2 billion</a>.

Not only does this make him the wealthiest individual in both auto racing and soccer, it also makes him the fourth-richest sports team owner. And to think we were under the impression that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-highest-paid-nascar-drivers-in-2016.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-paid NASCAR drivers</a> were the ones pulling in serious bank.

</div>
While Paul Allen is most famously known for being a cofounder of Microsoft, we're here to discuss his portfolio, which includes multiple sports franchises. Allen owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks as well as the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. With a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/3-paul-allen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net worth of $17.5 billion</a>, he is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-richest-owners-in-the-league.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealthiest owner in the National Football League</a> and the third-richest team owner in the world of sports.

<h2>2. Mukesh Ambani</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $19.3 billion

Although we may not actually know the rules of cricket, we do know that this sport is extremely prominent around the world. In fact, it happens to be India's most popular sport, which is why it should come as no surprise that Mukesh Ambani, the country's wealthiest individual and owner of the Mumbai Indians, is so high on this list. With the wealth he acquired through petrochemicals and oil and gas, Ambani became one of the three billionaire owners in the Indian Premier League and now <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/2-mukesh-ambani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holds a net worth of $19.3 billion</a>. Perhaps it's time we pay a little more attention to cricket.

<h2>1. Steve Ballmer</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $23.5 billion

Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, comes in as the wealthiest team owner in all of sports. And it's really not that close of a contest. Although he bought the Los Angeles Clippers back in 2014 for $2 billion, Ballmer's overall wealth, according to Forbes, increased by $2 billion over the past year thanks to the rise (18%) in Microsoft's stock. As a result, the man is now <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffhjh/1-steve-ballmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth $23.5 billion</a>. Now that is what we call a <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=14874591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slam dunk</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[The 39 members of the Forbes 400 that own an American sports team are worth a combined $182 billion. Here's a look at the five richest owners of the bunch.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_861970" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chris-Paul-and-Steve-Ballmer-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-861970" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chris-Paul-and-Steve-Ballmer-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Chris Paul and Steve Ballmer embrace after the game" width="757" height="516" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

In our next life, we’d like to come back as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-richest-nfl-team-owners.html/?a=viewall">owner of an American sports team</a>. Is that really too much to ask?

It’s not even about the money. For us, the idea of being fully invested in a professional sports franchise sounds almost too good to be true. And we know we’re not the only ones who fantasize about this becoming a reality. Of course, while running a major pro team isn’t all about the dollar bills — at least not for us — it’s impossible to make this happen without a fairly large war chest at your disposal.

How much money are we really talking about? So glad you asked. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/09/29/americas-richest-sports-team-owners-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the good folks at Forbes</a>, “Thirty-nine members or nearly 10% of the Forbes 400 are the controlling owner or managing partner of a team in the four major U.S. sports leagues. They own 47 teams with seven people owning multiple teams. The owners are worth a combined $182 billion."

Yeah, we know. It’s kind of ridiculous. However, what’s even crazier to think about is that some owners actually trump others by a considerable amount. Then again, maybe it is about the money. Therefore, with that in mind, here’s a look at the five richest American sports team owners.

Net worth: $7.6 billion

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/stanley-kroenke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanley Kroenke</a> has a pretty sweet gig. Thanks to the wealth he amassed through real estate, Kroenke was able to grow a lucrative sports empire. As the owner of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/stl/st.-louis-rams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA Rams</a>, Colorado Avalanche, and Denver Nuggets — among others — Forbes estimates that Kroenke has a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feemf/5-stanley-kroenke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net worth of $7.6 billion</a>. Considering he is also married to a Walmart heiress, we’d say the only thing missing from his life is an NFL franchise in Saint Louis.

Now that he’s no longer in the family business, Arison can put all his focus toward running his NBA franchise, the <a href="http://www.nba.com/heat/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami Heat</a>. With a net worth of $7.7 billion, Arison has never been shy about spending money to help the team win championships. Of course, with LeBron James’ talents no longer in South Beach, that task should prove harder than ever before.</div>

Clearly the world of investments has been good to <a href="http://kings.nhl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Los Angeles Kings</a> owner Philip Anschutz. After all, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feemf/3-philip-anschutz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Forbes notes</a>, he does have a net worth of $10.9 billion. What should one do with all that wealth? Own more sports franchises, obviously. With the Los Angeles Galaxy and Houston Dynamo as part of his portfolio, it would appear Anschutz holds a soft spot for the beautiful game.

Seattle Seahawks owner <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/paul-allen-9542239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Allen</a> is the wealthiest among those who own NFL franchises. Considering he was a co-founder of Microsoft, are you really that surprised he’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feemf/2-paul-allen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth $17.8 billion</a>? Neither are we. Now if only his NBA team, the Portland Trail Blazers, could figure out a way to deal with the competitive Western Conference. Then Allen would prove to be an even better investor than he already is.

Net worth: $21.6 billion

As far as America’s richest sports team owners are concerned, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-ballmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Ballmer</a> takes the cake. Prior to last year, he was the CEO of Microsoft. Now, Ballmer owns 4% of the company, making him the largest individual shareholder. With a total <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feemf/1-steve-ballmer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net worth of $21.6 billion</a>, it’s no wonder he was able to drop $2 billion to purchases the Los Angeles Clippers.

Whether you’re a fan of NASCAR or not, it’s impossible to say that drivers aren’t putting their lives on the line each and every time they take their cars out onto the track. The overwhelming evidence is in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-worst-wrecks-in-nascar-history.html/" target="_blank">horrific accidents the sport has seen</a> throughout its history. As a result, it should come as no surprise that, when you take into consideration the dangers associated with the race itself and the loyalty of the sport’s fanbase, the top drivers make serious bank. Last year represented a perfect example of that.

According to Forbes, not only did 13 drivers <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/02/17/nascars-highest-paid-drivers-2016/#6207964e2b74" target="_blank">make over $10 million</a> courtesy of salaries, bonuses, endorsements, and a share of winnings and licensing, but these same individuals combined to make $198 million in total earnings during the 2015 season. That’s a lot of doughnuts worth of cash. Of course, as it always is in pro sports, some individuals made more than the rest. With that in mind, here’s a look at the five highest-paid NASCAR drivers in 2016.

<h2>5. Denny Hamlin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_756710" align="aligncenter" width="755"]<img class=" wp-image-756710" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Denny-Hamlin-Sarah-Carbill-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="HOMESTEAD, FL - NOVEMBER 18:  Denny Hamlin, driver of the #11 FedEx Express Toyota, stands on the grid during qualifying for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway on November 18, 2016 in Homestead, Florida.

<div id="copy_box_content" class="copy_box_content">

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $15.1 million

Denny Hamlin had a banner year in 2015, pulling in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffgld/5-denny-hamlin/" target="_blank">$15.1 million in total earnings</a>. While $13.1 million was a result of salary and winnings, Hamlin was able to earn $2 million in endorsements and licensing thanks to his sponsorship deals with companies like Denny’s Restaurants (obviously), Toyota, Coca-Cola, Greenbrier resort, and Nike’s Jordan brand. Clearly this is what happens when one finishes in the top two in seven consecutive races during the 2014-15 Nascar seasons.

<h2>4. Kevin Harvick</h2>
[caption id="attachment_950110" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kevin-Harvick-Jared-C.-Tilton-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-950110" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kevin-Harvick-Jared-C.-Tilton-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin Harvick during a practice for the Daytona 500" width="757" height="497" /></a> Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $15.5 million

While Kevin Harvick earned a combined $12 million from his salary and winnings, according to Forbes, the $11.7 million he made in winnings alone happened to be the most in the sport in 2015. On top of that, Harvick pulled in $3.5 million in endorsements and licensing thanks to an impressive list of sponsors that include Chevrolet, Budweiser, Bad Boy Buggies, Hunt Brothers Pizza, Morton Buildings, Wiley X sunglasses, Cessna and Greenlee. With <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffgld/4-kevin-harvick/" target="_blank">$15.5 million in total earnings</a>, Harvick ended 2015 as the fourth highest-paid driver in Nascar.

<h2>3. Jeff Gordon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590492" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class=" wp-image-590492" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Jeff-Gordon_Rainier-Ehrhardt_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="INDIANAPOLIS, IN - JULY 27:  Jeff Gordon, driver of the #24 Axalta Chevrolet, celebrates with the trophy after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Crown Royal Presents The John Wayne Walding 400 at the Brickyard Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 27, 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $21.6 million

In 2015, Jeff Gordon’s final season on the track, the superstar made $14.6 million in winnings and salaries, while pulling in an additional $7 million from his licensing and endorsement deals. Gordon’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffgld/3-jeff-gordon/" target="_blank">$21.6 million in total earnings</a> made him Nascar’s third highest-paid driver in 2015.

<h2>2. Jimmie Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_950113" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jimmie-Johnson-Jeff-Curry-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-950113" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jimmie-Johnson-Jeff-Curry-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jimmie Johnson during a practice for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Ford EcoBoost 400 " width="757" height="477" /></a> Jeff Curry/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $22.2 million

If there’s one thing you can expect from Jimmie Johnson, it’s that the Lowe’s No. 48 car is going to win. A lot. In 2015, the six-time Nascar Sprint Cup champion earned $16.4 million in winnings and salary money, which also paved the way for him to take home $5.8 million through endorsements and licensing deals. While Johnson’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffgld/2-jimmie-johnson/" target="_blank">$22.2 million in total earnings</a> was only second among Nascar drivers in 2015, we’d be crazy to associate a haul like that with a losing season.

<h2>1. Dale Earnhardt Jr.</h2>
[caption id="attachment_756713" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-756713" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Earnhardt-Jr.-Jerry-Markland-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="WATKINS GLEN, NY - AUGUST 09: (L-R) Denny Hamlin, driver of the #11 FedEx Ground Toyota, Brad Keselowski, driver of the #2 Miller Lite/Luke Bryan Ford, Martin Truex Jr., driver of the #78 Furniture Row/Visser Precision Chevrolet, and Dale Earnhardt Jr., driver of the #88 Nationwide Chevrolet, talk behind stage prior to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Cheez-It 355 at the Glen at Watkins Glen International on August 9, 2015 in Watkins Glen, New York.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $23.5 million

For the eighth consecutive year, Dale Earnhardt Jr. was Nascar’s highest-paid driver. According to Forbes, while Earnhardt took home an impressive $15 million in salary and winnings in 2015, his endorsement deals are what distinguish him from the pack. Thanks to sponsorships with big brands like Nationwide, Taxslayer, Axalta ,Wrangler, Goody’s, and Chevrolet, Earnhardt pulled in $8.5 million from endorsements and licensing, taking his <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffgld/1-dale-earnhardt-jr/" target="_blank">total haul in 2015 to $23.5 million</a>. It’s no wonder that he was voted Nascar’s highest-paid driver for the 13th straight season.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_654170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-654170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-534344014.jpg" alt="5 Highest-Paid Athletes in the World in 2016" width="757" height="504" /> LeBron James warms up | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

In the world of professional sports, everyone knows that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-richest-sports-team-owners-in-the-world.html/" target="_blank">over-the-top riches belong to the team owners</a>. The fact is, it takes a lot of money to foot the bill. However, that doesn't mean the athletes themselves are suffering from a financial standpoint -- not even close.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/06/08/the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes-of-2016/#18c58104538d" target="_blank">According to Forbes</a>, over the last year, the 100 highest-earning athletes pulled in a combined $3.15 billion -- that's billion with a "B." To determine this, the good folks at Forbes used a fairly <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/06/08/the-worlds-100-highest-paid-athletes-2016-by-the-numbers/#1369e8b061cc" target="_blank">detailed methodology</a>; however, the simpler explanation is as follows:
<blockquote>Our earnings figures include salaries, prize money and bonuses paid out between June 1, 2015, and June 1, 2016. Endorsement incomes are an estimate of sponsorships, appearance fees and licensing incomes for the same 12 month period based on conversations with dozens of industry insiders. We do not deduct for taxes or agents’ fees and we don’t include investment income.</blockquote>
It's not surprising that athletes make a lot of money -- this is something we all know. Yet, when it comes to determining which athletes make the most money, that order may throw some for a loop. With that in mind, here's a look at the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickdesantis/2016/06/20/the-top-25-highest-paid-athletes-of-2016-visualized/#3845309221e4">25 highest-paid athletes</a> in the world in 2016.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>25. Gareth Bale</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673688" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673688" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gareth-Bale-David-Ramos-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Gareth Bale getting it done for Real Madrid. | David Ramos/Getty Images" width="757" height="518" /> Gareth Bale gets paid well at Real Madrid | David Ramos/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $35.9 million

Gareth Bale has been instrumental in Real Madrid's success ever since the club acquired him for a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/expensive-soccer-transfer-fees.html/">world-record transfer fee</a> back in 2013. As a result, the Welshman is handsomely rewarded both on and off the pitch. In 2016, Bale earned $24.9 million in salary and bonuses and another $11 million from endorsements. If he maintains his high level of play, companies like Adidas will be more than happy to continue throwing money at him.

<h2>24. Fernando Alonso</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735514" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735514" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Fernando-Alonso-YUYA-SHINO-AFP-Getty-Images-640x448.jpg" alt="Fernando Alonso gets paid big bucks to drive for McLaren-Honda | YUYA SHINO/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="529" /> Fernando Alonso gets paid big bucks to drive for McLaren-Honda | YUYA SHINO/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $36.5 million

Fernando Alonso is one of the most successful Formula One drivers on the planet and he has the bank account to prove it. Although he's <em>only</em> pulling in $1.5 million in endorsement money this year, the McLaren-Honda driver is living large thanks to his $35 million salary. As you can see, Alonso clearly believes the reward is well worth the risk

<h2>23. Zlatan Ibrahimovic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735522" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735522" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-PAUL-ELLIS-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his money at Man U | PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Zlatan Ibrahimovic makes his money at Man U | PAUL ELLIS/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $37.4 million

Soccer fans know that Zlatan Ibrahimovic gets paid to put the ball in the back of the net; as evidenced by the $30.4 million he's earning this year as a member of Manchester United. Still, it's important not to overlook just how popular the Swedish striker actually is. With a Nike deal, his own line of sportswear (A-Z), and relationships with other brands, Ibrahimovic is also collecting $7 million in endorsement money in 2016. There is no shortage of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pro-sport-likely-make-famous.html/">opportunities for soccer players</a>.

<h2>21. (tie) Rafael Nadal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_558854" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-558854 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Rafael-Nadal-Julian-Finney-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Rafael-Nadal-Julian-Finney-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Rafael Nadal is one of tennis' biggest moneymakers | Julian Finney/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $37.5 million

Over the past year, Rafael Nadal earned $5.5 million for his efforts on the tennis court. While that figure is hardly chump change, it pales in comparison to the money he makes away from the sport. Thanks to relationships with companies like Kia, Tommy Hilfiger, and Nike among others, Nadal's earned himself $32 million in sponsorship money. Even if Nadal never goes back to his winning ways, something tells us he'll continue to be just fine.

<h2>21. (tie) Neymar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638915" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638915" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Neymar-Gonzalo-Arroyo-Moreno-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Neymar reacts while playing for Barcelona. | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Neymar makes bank at Barcelona. | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $37.5 million

With Barcelona, Neymar is making $14.5 million in salary this season. However, like many of the athletes on this list, his real earnings stem from endorsements. The Brazilian superstar has sponsorships deals with companies such as Red Bull, Gillette, Nike, Panasonic, and Konami, and is taking home $23 million this year because of those relationships. Oddly enough, even at $37.5 million in total earnings, Neymar fails to crack the top 20

<h2>20. Philip Rivers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_531352" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-531352 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Philip-Rivers1.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="611" /> Philip Rivers can make it rain if he wants to | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $38 million

Despite being a starting quarterback in the NFL, Philip Rivers isn't exactly rolling in endorsement money, having earned just $450,000 in the last year. Of course, thanks to $37.5 million in salary and bonuses, it's not as if the Chargers signal caller is exactly strapped for cash. The joys of the San Diego weather doesn't hurt, either.

<h2>19. Sebastian Vettel</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735525" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735525" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sebastian-Vettel-ANDREJ-ISAKOVIC-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ferrari has a lot invested in Sebastian Vettel | ANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="547" /> Ferrari has a lot invested in Sebastian Vettel | ANDREJ ISAKOVIC/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $41 million

Only $1 million of Sebastian Vettel's total earnings in 2016 came from endorsements. But when you're getting paid $40 million in salary and bonuses from Ferrari, you tend to not sweat the <em>small</em> things. If only we could all be Formula One driver.

<h2>18. Russell Wilson</h2>
&nbsp;

[caption id="attachment_536361" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-536361 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Russell-Wilson1.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> Russell Wilson is worth every penny | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $41.8 million

As one of the brightest young talents in the National Football League, it only makes sense that Russell Wilson would be paid as such. In past year, Seattle's quarterback has collected $31.8 million in salary and bonus money while pulling in $10 million in endorsements from companies like Nike, Microsoft, Bose, Braun, and others. If Wilson can help the Seahawks overcome their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/can-the-seattle-seahawks-win-the-super-bowl-without-earl-thomas.html/">latest setback</a>, there's no telling how high his stock will climb.

<h2>17. Rory McIlroy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_655591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-655591" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Rory-McIlroy_Andrew-Redington_Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="Andrew Redington/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The game of golf has been good to Rory McIlroy | Andrew Redington/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $42.6 million

Even when Rory McIlroy isn't dominating on the golf course (by his standards, anyway), his marketability remains at an all-time high. McIlroy has relationships with Upper Deck, Bose, Electronic Arts, and Nike among others, and as a result, managed to bank $35 million in sponsorship money this past year. Imagine what that number would look like if he was winning on a regular basis. Scary, we know.

<h2>16. Floyd Mayweather</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679049" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679049" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Floyd-Mayweather-Jr._Al-Bello_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Al Bello/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Floyd Mayweather is so money | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $44 million

In the last year, endorsements, appearances, and merchandise sales netted Floyd Mayweather $12 million. But that's nothing compared to the $32 million he earned from just one fight. As you can plainly see, there's a reason people call him "Money."

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>15. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709314" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709314" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tom-Brady-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady is nearly perfect against the Jags | Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> It's good to be Tom Brady | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $44.1 million

Like a fine wine, Tom Brady appears to only be getting better with age. Last year, he earned $8 million from endorsements and collected another $36.1 million from salary and bonus money. At this rate, as is the case with their quarterback's bank account, the New England Patriots' Super Bowl odds should continue to grow.

<h2>14. Joe Flacco</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660652" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660652" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Flacco_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-593x500.jpg" alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="639" /> Thumbs up for Joe Flacco | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $44.5 million

To the surprise of pretty much everyone, Joe Flacco <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">makes more money than Tom Brady</a>. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback isn't "wowing" folks with his portfolio of endorsements, but with $44 million in salary and bonus money over the past 12 months, he doesn't have to. Oh, the perks of winning a Super Bowl.

<h2>13. Eli Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_668765" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-668765" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Eli-Manning_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-2-640x431.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="510" /> Eli Manning makes a nice living for himself | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $45 million

Speaking of which, enter New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. In the past 12 months, Peyton's little brother has earned $8 million from endorsements and pulled in a whopping $37 million in salary and bonuses. Oh, the perks of winning <em>two</em> Super Bowls.

<h2>12. Tiger Woods</h2>
[caption id="attachment_622524" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-622524" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tiger-Woods_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images-640x407.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="481" /> Tiger Woods still makes bank | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $45.3 million

Tiger Woods doesn't need to top the competition in tournaments to remain one of the highest-paid athletes on the planet. While he's only earned $274,000 in prize money over the last year, Woods still made $45 million from endorsements. The moral of the story: Winning isn't everything.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $46 million

The top Formula One drivers in the world make serious bank, and Lewis Hamilton is no exception. Thanks to partnerships with brands like Monster Energy, IWC, and L'Oreal, Hamilton took home $4 million in endorsement money over the last 12 months. He also earned $42 million in salary and bonuses from Mercedes. Unfortunately for him, $46 million in total earnings isn't enough to crack the top 10 of this particular list.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $50 million

In case you slept on it, 2016 marked the close of Kobe Bryant's NBA career -- and while the Lakers may have seen something of an ignoble finish, Kobe's bank account was hardly worse for the wear: the Lakers' icon banked <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-lakers/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank">a cool $25 million</a> to close out the season, making him the highest paid player in the league over last year, at least in terms of the size of his deal. The rest of it comes from endoresments: Kobe's been signed to Nike ever since his bailing on his deal with Adidas, inked when Kobe was fresh out of high school, <a href="http://www.cardboardconnection.com/kobe-bryant-shoes-guide-history" target="_blank">after Bryant reportedly disliked the Kobe Two, </a>and it's safe to say that his other deals, with companies like Coca-Cola, haven't left him hurting for cash.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $52.8 Million

<span class="message_body"> Jordan Spieth's meteoric rise has not only made him one of the biggest names in pro golf, it's almost made him one of the richest athletes on the planet. Consider: </span>despite a disappointing finish at the 2016 Masters -- where Spieth, the defending champion, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/golf/2016/4/10/11404180/jordan-spieth-masters-2016-loss" target="_blank">choked about as hard as you could imagine</a> on the last day of the tournament -- he's still one of two professional golfers to make this list.

<span class="message_body">In the past 12 months, the current World No. 5 earned $32 million in endorsement money (thanks, Under Armour) and took home $20.8 million in prize money. As long as golf's golden boy continues to add major championships to his name, the $52.8 million he banked in the last year will be chump change compared to his future earnings.</span>

<h2>7. Cam Newton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_642565" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642565" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cam-Newton_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="514" /> Cam Newton at work, and at play, all at once |Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $53.1 million

Cam Newton may be the most magnetic personality in the NFL today -- whether you're attracted or repelled, by him, there's no denying that you're pulled one way or the other -- and with that sort of star quality comes big money (and his very own laptop, we presume). <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-cam-newton-still-has-one-major-problem.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">The best player in Super Bowl 50</a>, Newton's athletic ability has earned him a $100 million dollar from the league ($60 of that is guaranteed), and as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12990868/cam-newton-trails-only-peyton-manning-terms-marketing-appeal-nfl" target="_blank">one of the most marketable players in the league</a>, he can more or less take the pick of the litter when it comes to endorsements.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $55.8 million

After Novak Djokovic claimed victory over Andy Murray in the 2016 French Open, he became the first player to hold all four Major titles since Rod Laver -- not bad for a guy that's somewhat lagged in popularity behind his immediate contemporaries (contemporaries he's now eclipsed, somewhat unequivocally).  In fact, while Djokovic now has something that, say, Roger Federer does not, he's still <em>only</em> pulling in $34 million in endorsements. If he can challenge for the sport's first Grand Slam in nearly 50 years, that will almost certainly change.

<h2>5. Kevin Durant</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $56.2 million

In the last year, Kevin Durant took home $20.2 million in salary and bonuses, earned another $36 million in endorsement deals, and found himself at No. 5 on the list of the world's highest-paid athletes with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffmil/5-kevin-durant/" target="_blank">$56.2 million in total earnings</a>. Hopefully this impressive haul will take some of the sting out of OKC's inability to finish off the Dubs in the Western Conference Finals. Although, we highly doubt it.

<h2>4. Roger Federer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_591812" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-591812" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Roger-Federer-KARIM-SAHIB-AFP-Getty-Images-640x418.jpg" alt="5 Highest-Paid Athletes in the World in 2016" width="757" height="495" /> Roger Federer plays a shot | Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $67.8 million

Roger Federer may not be the same tennis player who competes for Grand Slams on a regular basis, but that hasn't stopped him from holding serve as the sport's top-earning player. Thanks to his sponsorship deals with companies like Rolex, Nike, and Mercedes-Benz, Federer managed to take home an insane $60 million dollars in endorsement money over the last 12 months.

When you combine that with the $7.8 million he earned in prize money, you're looking at a whopping <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffmil/4-roger-federer/" target="_blank">$67.8 million in total earnings</a> for the 17-time Grand Slam champion. It's safe to say that even when King Roger's not winning, he's winning.

<h2>3. LeBron James</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $77.2 million

Although <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/lebron-james/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> is on the brink of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-players-lose-least-4-nba-finals.html/" target="_blank">another Finals loss</a>, he can take solace in knowing that his bank account is far from suffering the same sort of defeat -- and likely never will. Aside from making $23.2 million in salary money, LBJ reaffirmed his unrivaled marketability courtesy of $54 million from endorsements.

On top of that, thanks to the unprecedented lifetime deal he signed with Nike, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffmil/3-lebron-james/" target="_blank">$77.2 million in total earnings</a> that James made over the past year is going to look like peanuts compared to his future earnings.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $81.4 million

Not only has Lionel Messi's creativity and magic on the pitch made him one of the top-two soccer players in the world, it's always made him one of the top-two highest-earning athletes on the planet. And that's a fact.

Despite making $28 million from endorsements over the past year (thanks, Adidas), the majority of Messi's <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffmil/2-lionel-messi/" target="_blank">$81.4 million in total earnings</a> came from his salary and bonuses -- $53.4 million to be exact. It's no wonder they call soccer "the beautiful game."

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total Earnings</span>: $88 million

Like Real Madrid after winning the Champions League, Cristiano Ronaldo is on top of the world (of highest-paid athletes). To this, we have just one word: shocker. Thanks to his sponsorship deals with brands such Nike, Tag Heuer, and Herbalife, as well as his own line of products, Ronaldo brought home $32 million in endorsement money over the last 12 months.

Of course, this figure pales in comparison to the $56 million he earned in salary and bonuses. Either way, the dollar signs have spoken, and with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45ffmil/1-cristiano-ronaldo/" target="_blank">$88 million in total earnings</a>, Ronaldo secured his place as the highest-earning athlete in 2016.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_683201" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-683201" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Samir-Ait-Said-Alex-Livesey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Worst Olympic Injuries in History" width="757" height="504" /> Samir Ait Said of France receives medical attention in Rio | Alex Livesey/Getty Images[/caption]

No Olympic Games are perfect. Some may turn out to be less chaotic than others, but in terms of the event itself, perfection is not really attainable. Coming into the 2016 Rio Games, with all the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-things-rio-olympics.html/">rumored problems</a>, many of us expected the worst. Granted, it would take a catastrophe of epic proportions for these Olympics to be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-things-ever-happened-olympics.html/">historically bad</a>, but at this point, anything was possible.

That said, if we only view the Olympics through a "big picture" scope, we often tend to forget about all of the individual struggles that have taken place throughout the history of these Games. Unfortunately, many of these incidents involve something that you hope to never see at a sporting event of this magnitude: an injury.

As much as athletes hope to avoid painful experiences, especially Olympic injuries, sometimes, there's nothing anyone can do about it. These setbacks come with the territory. It's part of the price you pay for glory. When it comes to the Olympic Games, these seven individuals paid that price in a major way, experiencing some of the worst Olympic injuries we've ever seen.
<h3>Full disclosure: The following images and videos are pretty graphic.</h3>
<h2>1. Derek Redmond's hamstring injury</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjkBPthoYVg"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona

In the 400-meter semifinals at the 1992 Barcelona Games, Great Britain's Derek Redmond appeared poised to earn himself a spot in the final. Unfortunately for him, the injury bug struck at the worst possible moment. Redmond heard a "pop" in his right hamstring and went down almost immediately.

Despite the realization that his Olympic dream was over, Redmond was determined to finish the race. He got to his feet and began to hobble down the track. It was in that moment that one of the most memorable scenes in Olympic history unfolded -- Redmond's father joined him on the track, put his arms around his son, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/94">helped him finish the race</a>. Ultimately, this is what the Olympic Games are about -- pride.

<h2>2. Greg Louganis bangs his head</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul

Although American diver Greg Louganis went on to win the gold medal for men's springboard diving at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, his victory didn't come without its setbacks. If you can even call banging you head on the diving board a "setback."

That's right, on his ninth dive of the preliminary round of the three-meter springboard competition, Louganis <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/77">slammed the back of his head on the board</a>. Of course, given that he's a ridiculous competitor, Louganis got four temporary stitches -- so he could complete his last two dives of the prelims -- before going to the hospital to get five "real" stitches. The things we do for gold.

<h2>3. Sa Jae-hyouk's brutal elbow injury</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECuCyMwRgn0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 2012 Summer Olympics in London

As far as graphic Olympics injuries go, this one is easily right near the top of the list. During the 2012 Summer Games in London, South Korean weightlifter Sa Jae-hyouk was attempting to lift 162kg (357 pounds) in the snatch when tragedy struck -- in the form of a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/weightlifter-sa-jae-hyouk-dislocates-elbow-london-olympics-083825819--oly.html">horribly dislocated elbow</a>.

Please be forewarned, if you choose to watch the above video, you will be grossed out. Trust us, it's bad.

<h2>4 Adrienne Nyeste's nasty fall</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FvlXC_3BZVw"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Hungarian gymnast Adrienne Nyeste took one of the nastiest falls we've ever seen. While performing a routine on the uneven bars, Nyeste lost control, flew through the air off the high bar, and slammed face-first into the mat. Although she laid on the ground motionless following the incident, Nyeste eventually rose to her feet, having avoided what could have been a catastrophic injury.

<h2>5. Kerri Strug overcomes her ankle injury</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZRYiOa5lM8"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta

Everyone knows about the heroic final vault of America's Kerri Strug at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Despite <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/51">tearing tendons in her ankle</a> during her first attempt, Strug rose to her feet, blocked out the pain, and went on to stick her second attempt (while landing on one ankle), securing the gold medal for Team USA in the process.

Said U.S. Coach Bela Karolyi to the media: "In my 35 years of coaching I have never seen such a moment. People think these girls are fragile dolls. They're not. They're courageous."

<h2>6. Janos Baranyai's gruesome elbow injury</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djeEXfwlPVA"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Games</span>: 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing

If you thought the previous weightlifting incident was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Hungary's Janos Baranyai, while attempting to lift 148 kilograms (326.3 pounds), dislocated his right elbow, <a href="http://www.espn.com/olympics/weightlifting/story/_/id/7662750/hungarian-weightlifter-janos-baranyai-back-injury">popping it out of the socket</a> and going through the sort of the pain that comes with having your forearm bent at an angle that shouldn't be humanly possible. Considering how brutal this incident is to watch (Warning: It's graphic.), we can only imagine how horrific it was to experience firsthand.

At these Rio Games, during the qualifying round of men's gymnastics, France's Samir Ait Said <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/gymnast-samir-ait-said-breaks-leg-vault-rio-olympics">fractured his tibia</a> on the landing of his vault attempt. The injury was so gruesome that NBA superstar -- and member of Team USA -- Paul George, who knows what it's like to experience a bad break, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/paul-george-feels-gymnast-pain-hopes-meet-samir-ait-article-1.2744218">felt the need to reach out</a> and is hoping to meet with the French Olympian. Talk about class in the face of tragedy.

			<title>NFL: 7 Names That Could Replace the ‘Washington Redskins’</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Washington Redskins controversy continues, but if the name does have to be changed, we suspect that these 7 are clear cut frontrunners.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_490025" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-490025" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Washington-Redskins-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="511" /> Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Let’s be clear before we start: the only way the Washington Redskins, NFL team and holder of one of the most consistently “hot-button” squad names in American sports, are going to undergo a moniker transfusion is if owner Dan Snyder is forcibly dragged into the street and paraded in front of a hostile majority that are unwilling to buy anything with the phrase or image ‘Redskin’ on it. That probably won’t happen, so Snyder probably won’t have to change his team’s name. FedEx and Budwieser could also pull their sponsorship dollars, but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-most-expensive-nfl-teams-to-see-on-the-road.html/">in an industry that makes their own money like the NFL</a>, this seems unlikely. He could also have a change of heart, but that too, seems distant.

Why bother, then? It’s very easy to envision a future where the Redskins don’t have their name, and they aren’t regularly summoned to be a point of contention for people to treat politics like team sports by arguing about them. Whether or not the Redskins should change their name is largely irrelevant, since the arguments for one side are painfully tone deaf and the arguments on the other side are seriously lacking in empathy.

The Washington Redskins, as an organization, probably want to be able to set about reclaiming what was a mostly underwhelming team last year, with a quarterback that looked like damaged goods in RGIII and the prevailing wisdom that they might have overperformed to reach their 9-7 record from 2015.  One easy way to do that would be, of course, to just change the name rather than bunkering down — to push the metaphor they chose — like they’re in the Alamo.

Few things go together more snugly than American football and militarism. As something of a refuge for macho culture and the image projection that goes along with it, the Washington Warriors seems like a fairly obvious candidate for a rebranding image, especially if you take <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/01/if-name-changes-would-washington-logo-be-acceptable/" target="_blank">the opinion shared by Mike Florio</a>, that you could keep the logo the same if you did enact the swap. The Warriors is consistently a popular choice whenever discussions around changing the team’s name surface, which has been a fairly constant and regular occurrence since the early 1990s.

<h2>6. The Washington Skins</h2>

Another popular choice, shortening “Redskins” to ‘Skins’ (or its functional alternative, the Washington Pigskins) would serve to alleviate some of the unfamiliarity that Washington fans would feel if forced to endure a name swap — which seems to be a large source of the ire and agitation on behalf of those who want the name to stay. No one seriously thinks that the majority of Redskins supporters are actually racist or bigoted, anyway, it’s just a question of where your empathy lies: with Dan Snyder or with someone else.

If this were to be the answer, though, they’d have to go all the way with it, pulling all the Native American imagery off of their branded merchandise. Not that there’s inherently anything wrong with that, but it definitely puts it second to the Warriors if either was going to be grabbed. Those are two of the safe choices. Now lets get on to the more adventurous ones.

<h2>5. The Washington D.C. Football Club</h2>
[caption id="attachment_474808" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-474808" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Washington-Redskins-Greg-Fiume-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Washington-Redskins-Greg-Fiume-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="500" /> Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

This one gained some residual traction when Peter King, longtime <em>Sports Illustrated</em> writer announced that his vanity site, <em>The Monday Morning Quarterback</em>, wouldn’t be using the team’s current nickname. In 2013, <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2013/09/06/eli-manning-new-york-giants-dallas-cowboys/" target="_blank">King wrote that</a>, “I decided to stop entirely because it offends too many people, and I don’t want to add to the offensiveness. Some people, and some Native American organizations — such as the highly respected American Indian Movement — think the nickname is a slur. Obviously, the team feels it isn’t a slur, and there are several prominent Native American leaders who agree. But I can do my job without using it, and I will.”

This name falls into a tricky basket, though — namely that it sounds, well, European. That, typically, does not sit well with some NFL fans, who think poorly of any influence from anything that originates outside of the Continental 48.  Nevermind that the league is the most revenue-sharing friendly professional American Sports league (that’s a socialist principle hard at work), if it sounds <em>foreign</em>, it’s a nonstarter for some fans. It would also differentiate the team from the rest of the league — not necessarily a positive.

<h2>4. The Washington Redshirts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_694026" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-694026" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/washington-redskins-fan.jpg" alt="Washington Redskins fan" width="757" height="501" /> A Washington fan cheers during the game against the New York Giants September 23, 2007| Greg Fiume/Getty Images[/caption]

Since, you know, they finished 4-12 last season and features players that might not be ready for the NFL. This potential name, which came to our attention <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/183161779/washington-redshirts-uniform-look-mens" target="_blank">via a link to this Etsy listing</a>, is probably not going to be very popular among Washington fans — although we’re sure that everyone who roots for the 31 other teams in the league would heartily approve. If you’re unsure of what a redshirt is, it’s a college player who is “on the team,” attending practices and so forth, but doesn’t actively participate in the games.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. The Washington Senators</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553871" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553871" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/redskins-name-sign-sl-fea-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="426" /> Patrick McDermott/Getty Images[/caption]

Repurposing team names <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/#teams_inactive::none" target="_blank">is part of NFL history</a>, so changing from the Redskins to the Senators — in addition to being a baseball team, who were later renamed the Washington Nationals, as well as a professional football team with the name almost 100 years ago — doesn’t present any kind of stumbling block. The biggest concern, probably, would be that it references a group of that don’t hold a very high approval rating in this country, and that no one really wants to be reminded of the government when they’re trying to enjoy sports, since sports are, for most people, leisure activities. Even if they cause an inordinate amount of stress.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. The Washington Snyders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_550696" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-550696 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dan-Snyder-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-e1437768067646.jpg" alt="The one, the only, Dan Snyder | Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> The one, the only, Dan Snyder | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

If there’s one name that Dan Snyder values more than “Redskins,” it’s almost certainly his own surname, so this shift might be the most possible out of all the options presented. What you might not know is that many NFL teams have their nickname origins in fan voting contests — what’s to stop Snyder from holding another one, particularly if the patent office ruling is upheld (although chances are slim?) Imagine, for a moment, what might happen if a vote was held for a new team name. Thought about it? Then you’ve already realized why it’ll never happen.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. The Washington Maroons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_655979" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-655979" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Preston-Smith_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LANDOVER, MD - DECEMBER 20: Linebacker Preston Smith #94 of the Washington Redskins celebrates a tackle against the Buffalo Bills at FedExField on December 20, 2015 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images)" width="757" height="505" /> Preston Smith celebrates a tackle against the Buffalo Bills at FedExField on December 20, 2015 | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

One point for the choice — the Maroons have already been the name of many former American Football teams, so the rich tradition of the league is kept intact. One other point for the choice — the Redskins would only have to adjust their color scheme a little bit. One point against the choice — Maroon is, rather famously, Bugs Bunny’s mispronunciation of “moron,” which is not exactly the best social touchstone to use as a rallying cry around your team.

Of course, any rebranding of the Redskins would be wise to avoid a name that invokes the struggles of a minority that fought against people who disenfranchised them after crossing the Atlantic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Maroons-Jamaica-1655-1796-Collaboration/dp/0897891481" target="_blank">so maybe Maroons isn’t the best choice after all</a>. Hard to say, really.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_878332" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-878332" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Connor-McGregor-Clodagh-Kilcoyne-Getty-Images-for-Reebok.jpg" alt="DUBLIN, IRELAND - OCTOBER 22: Conor McGregor meets fans at a Reebok UFC Combat Gear retail event held at JD Sports on October 22, 2015 in Dublin, Ireland.." width="757" height="503" /> Clodagh Kilcoyne/Getty Images for Reebok[/caption]

In December 2015, the UFC met it's new superstar, Conor McGregor. The 27-year-old Irish fighter had long claimed that he would become the UFC’s biggest star, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ufc-194-review-of-jose-aldo-vs-conor-mcgregor-fight.html/" target="_blank">after he knocked out one of the pound-for-pound MMA greats, Jose Aldo, at UFC 194</a>, it looks like those claims have come true. McGregor’s rise, no matter your opinion on how it was handled by the UFC, has been meteoric.

He joined the promotion in April 2013 and <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/2013/4/11/4206216/conor-mcgregor-nothing-couldve-stopped-me-at-ufc-on-fuel-tv-9" target="_blank">fought on the untelevised portion</a> of a Fuel TV fight card in his debut. In his third fight, he headlined a UFC card in his homeland of Ireland. In July 2015, he <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/11/4/9667158/morning-report-ufc-194-conor-mcgregor-jose-aldo-dana-white-ronda-rousey-vanzant-mma-news" target="_blank">headlined a pay-per-view card</a> and won the interim featherweight title. Then, at UFC 194, he became the undisputed champion, defeating Aldo by knockout in 13 seconds. He has not lost in seven fights with the promotion, and he has only gone the distance on one occasion while with the UFC.

Now that he’s achieved his goal of becoming a UFC champion, things will pick up for McGregor. You can expect to see, and hear, a lot more from the outspoken fighter. The above are all pretty basic facts about McGregor; they can be found by merely searching online. But we discovered some behind-the-scenes info on this headstrong fighter. Read on to learn 10 obscure facts about McGregor.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. He’s big on visualization</h2>
[caption id="attachment_912988" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-912988" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Conor-McGregor-Steve-Marcus-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="on December 12, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada." width="757" height="500" /> Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

McGregor often says that a lot of his success in the Octagon can be attributed to visualization techniques. He reiterated this fact after knocking out Aldo at UFC 194. At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXHai7M7oU" target="_blank">post-fight press conference</a>, McGregor said:
<blockquote>If you can see it, and you have the courage to speak it, it will happen. I see these shots, I see these sequences, and I don’t shy away from them. A lot of times people believe in things, but they keep it to themselves, they don’t put it out there. If you truly believe in it, if you become vocal with it, you are creating the law of attraction and it will become reality.</blockquote>
<h2>2. He’s backed up all his predictions</h2>
McGregor is sometimes viewed as a brash trash-talker who says things to get attention or irritate his opponents — and it’s easy to believe it. However, when you dig a little deeper, you discover that every seemingly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXE_uzF8MX0" target="_blank">outlandish thing he has said</a> has come to fruition. In 2008, he declared that he would not only fight in the UFC, but he would become the UFC champion as well. He has accomplished both of those things.

Before he <a href="http://www.ufc.com/event/ufn-dublin-ireland?id=" target="_blank">fought Diego Brandao</a> in the main event of UFC Fight Night 46, McGregor claimed he would knock out his opponent in the first round. And that’s exactly what he did, stopping the fight with 55 seconds left in the round. Prior to UFC 178, McGregor said he would <a href="http://mmaversus.com/2014/09/28/dustin-poirier-vs-conor-mcgregor-fight-video-ufc-178/" target="_blank">knock out Dustin Poirier</a> in the first round. He accomplished that feat, handing Poirier the first knockout loss of his career, 1:46 into the first round.

In November 2014, McGregor predicted he would bring the <a href="http://mmapayout.com/2015/11/ufc-193-estimated-at-over-1m-ppv-buys-second-best-ever-per-fertitta/" target="_blank">largest pay-per-view numbers</a> and largest gate to the UFC. At UFC 194, he brought a Las Vegas record gate to the UFC with $10.1 million; his pay-per-view numbers for the fight trended as the highest in 2015, and maybe ever. Leading up to UFC 189, when he was originally booked to face Jose Aldo, McGregor said he thought Aldo would pull out of the fight. Aldo did drop out of that fight, citing an injury.

So the promotion booked McGregor against Chad Mendes on that card. Before meeting Mendes, McGregor told him on a media call that he would “<a href="http://mmajunkie.com/2015/07/nine-months-after-run-in-ufc-189s-conor-mcgregor-and-chad-mendes-still-rivals" target="_blank">Butcher you on the bottom</a>, (and) I’ll get back up and I’ll butcher you on the feet.” He did both of those things, abusing Mendes with elbows on the ground before standing up and finishing the fight standing. McGregor tried to bet UFC president Dana White and UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta $3 million that he would knock out Mendes in the second round. It’s a good thing the UFC bosses refused to participate, because McGregor knocked out Mendes with three seconds left in the second round.

Most recently he predicted that he would knock out Aldo in the first round, and well, he did that as well. So, what’s next for McGregor? No one is sure at this point, but whatever it is, history shows that you should put your money behind his predictions.

<h2>3. The last man who defeated McGregor is in the UFC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_912989" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-912989" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Conor-McGregor-2-Steve-Marcus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="on December 12, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada." width="757" height="486" /> Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

The last time McGregor lost a fight was November 2010. He lost that contest by submission just 38 seconds into the first round. Since then, McGregor has won 15 straight fights. The man who defeated McGregor on that Cage Warriors fight card was <a href="http://www.ufc.com/fighter/joseph-duffy?id=" target="_blank">Joseph Duffy</a>. Today, Duffy is a 14-1 fighter, competing in the UFC. He won his first two fights with the promotion by first round stoppage.

Duffy’s next fight will take place on January 2, 2016, when he <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/12/13/10042736/mma-news-dustin-poirier-vs-joseph-duffy-ufc-195-fight-pass-preliminary-card" target="_blank">faces former McGregor knockout victim</a> Dustin Poirier. Duffy currently fights at lightweight, one weight higher than McGregor presently competes at. However, McGregor has said he is interested in moving up to 155 pounds, so a rematch is not out of the question.
<h2>4. He has UFC records</h2>
McGregor has only fought in seven UFC fights, yet he is carving his name into the promotion’s history book. The records that currently belong to the newly minted featherweight champion include:
<ul>
 	<li>McGregor’s six knockout victories in UFC featherweight competition are the most in divisional history.</li>
 	<li>McGregor’s 13-second knockout victory marked the <a href="http://mmajunkie.com/2015/12/ufc-194-post-fight-facts-conor-mcgregor-tops-rouseys-record-by-1-second" target="_blank">fastest title-fight stoppage</a> in UFC history. (Ronda Rousey <a href="http://mmajunkie.com/2014/07/ufc-175-post-fight-facts-rousey-scores-second-fastest-title-fight-stoppage" target="_blank">held the previous record</a> with her 14-second stoppage of Cat Zingano at UFC 184 in February.)</li>
 	<li>McGregor became the sixth fighter in UFC history to earn five or more consecutive knockouts. (Chuck Liddell, Thiago Alves, Matt Brown, Junior Dos Santos and Ricco Rodriguez also accomplished the feat.)</li>
 	<li>He has the <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/shortest-fight-ufc-history-jose-aldo-falls-conor-mcgregor-404550" target="_blank">shortest average fight time in UFC</a> featherweight history at 5:35, almost a full minute less than the second shortest average fight time in the division.</li>
 	<li>McGregor is <a href="http://m.ufc.com/news/By-The-Numbers-UFC-178" target="_blank">first among UFC featherweights</a> in significant strikes landed with 5.53 per minute.</li>
 	<li>Finally, he is first in featherweights in strike differential at +2.51.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. He was on the Dole</h2>
[caption id="attachment_911964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-911964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Conor-McGregor-Steve-Marcus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor in their featherweight title fight during UFC 194 on December 12, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada." width="757" height="512" /> Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

At UFC 194, McGregor’s paycheck was $500,000. He also pulled in an extra $50,000 with a “Performance of the Night” bonus. With paydays like that, he is far removed from where he was when he first entered the UFC in 2013. McGregor debuted with the UFC on Fuel TV 9, where he <a href="http://www.mma-core.com/videos/Conor_McGregor_vs_Marcus_Brimage_UFC_on_Fuel_TV_9/10105600" target="_blank">defeated Marcus Brimage</a> by first round knockout. McGregor earned a $60,000 “Knockout of the Night” bonus for his efforts. When McGregor learned about the bonus at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STEJtHnCA0I" target="_blank">post-fight press conference</a>, he said:
<blockquote>To be honest, I don’t know what’s going on here, I’m just up here hearing $60,000. I’m just thinking of what I’m going to spend it on. I’m going to buy myself a nice car and maybe some suits or something, some custom-made suits. I don’t know. Just last week I was collecting the social welfare.</blockquote>
<h2>6. He was signed by the UFC without Dana White seeing him fight</h2>
When UFC president Dana White was in Dublin to accept an award from Trinity College, people kept asking him when the UFC was going to sign a fighter named Conor McGregor. The way the fans talked about McGregor, White thought he was a heavyweight. He discovered otherwise, yet he flew McGregor to Las Vegas for a meeting. After that meeting, the UFC signed McGregor to a five-fight deal. White <a href="http://www.esquire.com/sports/interviews/a34377/conor-mcgregor-interview-0515/" target="_blank">never saw McGregor fight</a> prior to signing him.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>7. He was asked to audition for a James Bond villain role</h2>
[caption id="attachment_878334" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-878334" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Connor-McGregor2-Clodagh-Kilcoyne-Getty-Images-for-Reebok.jpg" alt="DUBLIN, IRELAND - OCTOBER 22: Conor McGregor meets fans at a Reebok UFC Combat Gear retail event held at JD Sports on October 22, 2015 in Dublin, Ireland.

There are constants in James Bond films. The main character, James Bond is one of them, of course. Beautiful women are another Bond association, as well as the villains — and McGregor could have been one of the latter. During episode three of the recent “Notorious” special, McGregor <a href="http://www.independent.ie/sport/mma/conor-mcgregor-reveals-how-he-could-have-been-the-villain-in-the-new-james-bond-film-30979051.html" target="_blank">recounted the story</a> of how he almost became a Bond villain.
<blockquote>They want me to audition for the villain for James Bond. The last villain for James Bond won an Oscar. Your man that used to be in No County for Old Men [Javier Bardem]. He was unbelievable. I’m not that person. Do you know what I mean? I’m just doing it having a laugh. Don’t start putting in those serious things. But I’ll see how I feel. They were telling me this last week. It’s the wrong time to say it to me when I’m cutting weight. Maybe after the fight when I’m feeling better. We’ll mess about and see what happens. At the end of the day, it’s a seven figure thing. I’ll give it a shot. For seven figures it’s worth a go, isn’t it?</blockquote>
<h2>8. The UFC titles aren’t his first</h2>
McGregor has had gold strapped around his waist before UFC 194. As a member of Cage Warriors, he <a href="http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-path-of-conor-mcgregor-birth-of-the-notorious" target="_blank">won the promotion’s featherweight title</a> in June 2012. In his next fight, he won the Cage Warriors lightweight title. He did not get the chance to defend either of those titles because he signed with the UFC for his next fight.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. UFC 194 wasn’t his fastest KO</h2>
[caption id="attachment_911965" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-911965" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/McGregor-Aldo-Steve-Marcus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&lt;&gt; on December 12, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada." width="757" height="477" /> Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

McGregor knocked out Aldo in 13 seconds to claim the UFC featherweight title. While this is now the fastest knockout in UFC title fight history — beating <a href="http://mmajunkie.com/2014/07/ufc-175-post-fight-facts-rousey-scores-second-fastest-title-fight-stoppage" target="_blank">Ronda Rousey’s 14-second knockout</a> of Cat Zingano at UFC 184 — it isn’t McGregor’s fastest KO. McGregor once recorded a four-second knockout. He accomplished that feat in April 2011 when he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFxz6_TiGEs" target="_blank">knocked out Paddy Doherty</a> at Immortal Fighting Championship 4.
<h2>10. He once withdrew from a title fight</h2>
When Aldo withdrew from his UFC 189 fight against McGregor due to injury, McGregor was quick to taunt the then-champion for doing so. However, McGregor <a href="http://fightnetwork.com/news/6381320:conor-mcgregor-cage-warriors-title-defense-postponed/" target="_blank">did the same thing</a> when fighting for Cage Warriors in September 2012. He withdrew from his scheduled September 2012 featherweight title fight against Jim Alers after suffering a facial injury while training for the bout.

You have to be an impressive athlete to join the list of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/decorated-summer-olympians-time.html/">most decorated Summer Olympians of all time</a>. It's safe to say that U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte is as impressive as they come.

On Tuesday night, after helping the United States secure the gold medal in the men’s 800 free relay, Lochte earned his 12th career medal. In doing so, he passed the great Mark Spitz as the second-most decorated male swimmer in Olympic history. For Lochte, this win wasn't about getting in the record books, it was about something else: tradition. Said the 12-time medalist:
<blockquote>We just wanted to keep the tradition alive. Everyone did their part, but we couldn’t have done it without those three other guys this morning to really get us going and get us a good lane for tonight. We owe it to them. We wanted to defend that title, and that’s what we did.</blockquote>
As thoughtful as this response may sound (and it's definitely sincere), Lochte isn't exactly known for his eloquence. In fact, he's known for the exact opposite. Outside of the pool, the superstar swimmer is famous for his "bro-like" behavior, his ridiculous antics, and his "genius" insights.

In honor of his latest achievement, we took to Lochte's Twitter account to find examples that encapsulate these personality traits. We believe these seven do the trick.
<h2>1. Music metaphors are the best!</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Everyone wants to be a Rockstar but no one wants to learn the chords!</p>
— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/602644868612100097">May 25, 2015</a></blockquote>
Ryan Lochte gets it. He really does. Everyone wants to be a superstar, but not everyone is willing to put in the necessary time and effort. That is what he's saying, right? We hope so -- we don't know how to play guitar. It always seemed like too much work.

<h2>2. So true...</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Some times all u can say is jea jea jeah!!!!!!

— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/515748150473396224">September 27, 2014</a></blockquote>
If you're not familiar with the "word" Lochte managed to make famous, then you probably won't get this. If you are, then there's no way you could possibly disagree. In the end, "jeah" is all you need. That's what the Beatles meant to say.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Never stop plugging</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I've ditched the razor for <a href="https://twitter.com/GentleHairRemov">@GentleHairRemov</a>! Three treatments and now I’m always <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/silkysmooth?src=hash">#silkysmooth</a> <a href="https://t.co/mhwil5ff0M">https://t.co/mhwil5ff0M</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/getgentle?src=hash">#getgentle</a></p>
— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/761272571354505216">August 4, 2016</a></blockquote>
When you're paid a boatload of money from a sponsor to endorse the brand, plugging products comes with the territory. It's one of the many reasons why <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-athletes-world-2016.html/?">athletes make so much bank</a>. But even for a guy like Ryan Lochte, this one is a bit ridiculous. We can't think of one instance where it feels natural to say, "silky smooth." Unless, of course, you're referring to Gentle Hair Removal -- totally "safe, effective, comfortable."

<h2>4. Never change... unless it's your hair color</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">New look.... Here We Go <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio?src=hash">#Rio</a> #2016 thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/JennJonesATL">@jennjonesatl</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/turnup?src=hash">#turnup</a> <a href="https://t.co/A9ZOFz9h8k">https://t.co/A9ZOFz9h8k</a> <a href="https://t.co/k7aGDk3YRC">pic.twitter.com/k7aGDk3YRC</a>

— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/759874957132304384">July 31, 2016</a></blockquote>
Lochte may think his new hair color is "<a href="http://www.today.com/style/ryan-lochte-dyed-his-hair-icy-blue-rio-see-his-t101357">light blue</a>," but we're not buying it. And we're <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/scott-says-blog/article93670992.html">not the only ones who beg to differ</a> with the Olympic swimmer. Listen, we don't have a problem with changing one's appearance, and we certainly don't mind when someone wants to go with a "bold" new look. Just so long as they own it. Ryan, your hair color is white, bro. "Jeah," it's true.

<h2>5. Everyone loves a long T-shirt, right?</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coming soon!!! <a href="https://t.co/kR7EO14k6K">https://t.co/kR7EO14k6K</a> <a href="https://t.co/2gyBzDiF5m">pic.twitter.com/2gyBzDiF5m</a></p>
— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/722880793350184960">April 20, 2016</a></blockquote>
For the record, we don't. It doesn't matter if you're Kanye, Bieber, or Lochte, long T-shirts just look ridiculous. You're better than that. At least we hope you are.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. How dare you, sir?</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Trying my first espresso ever..... Yuck! <a href="http://t.co/ah3oOsScGk">pic.twitter.com/ah3oOsScGk</a>

— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/529525516189982720">November 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
It takes a lot for us to be truly insulted. This is one of those times. Espresso is delicious, Lochte. You better take that face back right now! We're serious. Not cool -- not cool at all.
<h2><!--nextpage-->
7. Is this real life?</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're ready to see the premiere of <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoolanderMovie">@zoolandermovie</a> already got my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bluesteel?src=hash">#bluesteel</a> down <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zoolander2?src=hash">#zoolander2</a> <a href="https://t.co/9IpPzQaXM5">pic.twitter.com/9IpPzQaXM5</a></p>
— Ryan Lochte (@RyanLochte) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanLochte/status/697584942000312320">February 11, 2016</a></blockquote>
Never before has life imitated art so perfectly. Lochte is Zoolander. Zoolander is Lochte. How did we not notice this sooner? This changes everything. It's settled -- Ryan Lochte is, in fact, a genius. He probably knows how to turn left as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_681799" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681799" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Usain-Bolt-Paul-Gilham-Getty-Images-640x458.jpg" alt="Usain Bolt has every reason to smile | Paul Gilham/Getty Images" width="757" height="542" /> Usain Bolt has every reason to smile | Paul Gilham/Getty Images[/caption]

As entertaining as the 2016 Rio Olympics has been, it's reasonable to suggest that we all would've been better served had the Games <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/rio-not-right-choice-olympics.html/">taken place at in a different city</a>. Unfortunately, once the decision was made to remain in Rio, all the fans could do was suck it up, hope none of the athletes got incredibly sick, and enjoy the show. And honestly, it's been as good as we could've hoped for.

In these Games, we saw the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/decorated-summer-olympians-time.html/">most decorated Olympian in history</a> add to his haul, we saw top athletes shatter world records that have stood for years, and we witnessed as many unknown individuals quickly become household names, securing future financial windfalls that should keep them sitting pretty for the rest of their lives. Of course, one the other hand, plenty of athletes came into the Games without needing to gain financial security; their bank accounts were already flush with cash.

With the 2016 Rio Games nearing its finish, it seems fitting that we take the time to examine these wealthy individuals. Here's a look at the 11 highest-paid athletes at the Summer Olympics in Rio.
<h2>11. Andy Murray</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660403" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660403" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Andy-Murray-Richard-Heathcote-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andy Murray celebrates being awesome. | Richard Heathcote/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Andy Murray celebrates being awesome. | Richard Heathcote/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $23 million

Heading into the Rio Games, Andy Murray had to be feeling good. Not only is he the No. 2 player in the world, he also recently won the second Wimbledon of his career. On top of that, he <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/11-andy-murray/#64e79fca4ee0">earned $23 million</a> last year, including $8 million in prize money and $15 million from endorsements. After a fantastic showing in Rio, we'd say he's about to cash in -- big time.

With his 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory over Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, Murray become the first tennis player in Olympic history to <a href="http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer/tennis/story/_/id/17304200/andy-murray-1st-win-2-olympic-tennis-singles-golds">win two gold medals in singles play</a>. Guess we forgot to mention that he also took home gold at the London Games in 2012.

<h2>10. Paul George</h2>
[caption id="attachment_632420" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632420" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paul-George-Vaughn-Ridley-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Paul George dribbles to the basket. | Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images" width="757" height="508" /> Paul George dribbles to the basket. | Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $24.1 million

After sustaining one of the most horrific injuries we've ever seen the last team he suited up for Team U.S.A., it's nice to see Paul George make another run at international glory in Rio. No matter what happens in these games, however, the Indiana Pacers superstar is still in good shape -- from a financial standpoint that is.

Aside from the $17.1 million he took home in salary last year, PG-13 also earned $7 million in endorsement money thanks to partnerships with companies like Nike, Gatorade, Fanatics, New Era, and Papa John's. With <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/10-paul-george/#5f099cbb3c47">total earnings of $24.1 million</a>, George is firmly planted in the 10th spot on this highest-paid athletes list.

<h2>9. Kyrie Irving</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $27.6 million

After solidifying his place as one of the top point guards in the NBA thanks a recent standout performance in the NBA Finals, Kyrie Irving comes into Rio at the top of his game -- both professionally and financially.

Just last year, Irving took home $11 million from endorsements and earned another $16.6 million in salary money. With <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/9-kyrie-irving/#574f85406e80">$27.6 million in total earnings</a>, we'd say it's officially time to stop underestimating Uncle Drew.

<h2>8. Serena Williams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_651387" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-651387" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Serena-Williams-PHILIPPE-LOPEZ-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Serena Williams thanks the crowd at the French Open. | PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Serena Williams thanks the crowd | PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $28.9 million

Serena Williams may have stumbled in her quest for gold in Rio, but that's hardly a reason to feel bad for her. The best female tennis player on the planet is doing fine -- better than fine.

Williams' recent victory at Wimbledon was the 22nd Grand Slam of her career, she made $8.9 million in prize money last year, and she generated $20 million in endorsement money, courtesy of relationships with brands such as Nike, Chase, Wilson, and Beats. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/8-serena-williams/#2cd342a5706f">$28.9 million in total earnings</a> -- yeah, we'd take it.

<h2>7. Carmelo Anthony</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674669" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674669" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Carmelo-Anthony-Ethan-Miller-Getty-Images-640x451.jpg" alt="Carmelo Anthony is so happy right now | Ethan Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="534" /> Carmelo Anthony is so happy right now | Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $30.9 million

Carmelo Anthony may never win an NBA title, but as he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/08/11/carmelo-anthony-three-olympic-gold-medals-but-no-nba-titles-would-be-a-great-career/">goes for his third career gold medal</a>, he still feels good about what he's been able to accomplish. And after learning what he made last year, we can't blame him.

Melo earned $8 million in endorsements and got <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/7-carmelo-anthony/#7037ed56998e">$22.9 million from the New York Knicks in salary money</a>. With just under $31 million in total earnings, it pays to be Carmelo Anthony.

<h2>6. Usain Bolt</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681801" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Usain-Bolt-Shaun-Botterill-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Usain Bolt is super fast | Shaun Botterill/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Usain Bolt is super fast | Shaun Botterill/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $32.5 million

For the third consecutive Olympics, Usain Bolt took home <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/usain-bolt-wins-third-straight-100m-gold">gold in the 100-meter dash</a>, retaining his title as the world's fastest man. And while the bragging rights that come with this honor are great, the financial perks are a little bit better.

If you think the $2.5 million Bolt earned in prize money and fees is nice, it pales in comparison to the loot he pulls in from endorsements -- <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/6-usain-bolt/#2610f70745a8">roughly $30 million per year</a>. Makes you wish you were just a hair faster, doesn't it?

<h2>5. Kei Nishikori</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681797" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681797" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Kei-Nishikori-LUIS-ACOSTA-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kei Nishikori gets the bronze | LUIS ACOSTA/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Kei Nishikori gets the bronze | LUIS ACOSTA/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $33.5 million

Although the $3.5 million in prize money that Kei Nishikori made last year is hardly anything to sneeze about, we are easily more blown away by the amount of dough he generates from endorsements. It's pretty staggering.

Thanks to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/5-kei-nishikori/#3a72ca78a408">deals with brands like Uniqlo</a>, Nishikori made $30 million in endorsement money last year. Considering he just took home the bronze medal in Rio, we think that number is only going to get higher.

<h2>3. (tie) Rafael Nadal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_596036" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-596036" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rafael-Nadal-MARWAN-NAAMANI-AFP-Getty-Images-640x414.jpg" alt="MARWAN NAAMANI/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="490" /> Rafael Nadal gets his focus on | MARWAN NAAMANI/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $37.5 million

Injuries have hindered Rafael Nadal's chances at winning more tournaments, thus hurting his prize money haul, but the same cannot be said for his overall popularity. Nadal is one of the most recognizable sports figures in the world; something his endorsement money clearly reflects.

Just last year, the Spanish superstar took home $32 million in sponsorship money, giving him <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/3-rafael-nadal/#48640751ec2f">$37.5 million in total earnings</a>. Even if he's never able to regain his dominance on the court, something tells us Rafa will be just fine.

<h2>3. (tie) Neymar</h2>
[caption id="attachment_638915" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-638915" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Neymar-Gonzalo-Arroyo-Moreno-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Neymar reacts while playing for Barcelona. | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Neymar reacts while playing for Barcelona. | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $37.5 million

Considering he is one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-worlds-5-highest-paid-soccer-players-in-2016.html/">highest-paid soccer players</a> in the world, it's hardly a surprise to see Neymar on this particular list. Just last year, the Brazilian standout earned $23 million in endorsement money from companies like Nike, Red Bull, and Gillette while also pulling in $14.5 million from his salary with Barcelona. All that's left to do now is help Brazil win gold in Rio. We'll know soon enough if he can make that a reality.

<h2>2. Novak Djokovic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679401" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679401" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Novak-Djokovic-ROBERTO-SCHMIDT-AFP-Getty-Images-640x434.jpg" alt="Even Novak Djokovic cries | ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="513" /> Even Novak Djokovic cries | ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $55.8 million

Despite losing in his first-round match in Rio, easily one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-biggest-upsets-rio-olympics-far.html/?">biggest upsets of the Games</a>, Novak Djokovic is still among the most dominant athletes on the planet. And his financial situation a perfection representation of that.Last year, the World No. 1 made $21.8 million in prize money and earned $34 million in endorsements, making him the second highest-paid Summer Olympian with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/2-novak-djokovic/#1ad00c831b34">$55.8 million in total earnings</a>.

<h2>1. Kevin Durant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681792" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681792" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Kevin-Durant-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin Durant is No. 1 | Rob Carr/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Kevin Durant is No. 1 | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $56.2 million

Kevin Durant's decision to join the Golden State Warriors may have been met with negativity, but sometimes, even the great ones are forced to endure such hardships. Fortunately for KD, he simply needs to look at his bank statement if he ever finds himself feeling down.

The Durantula earned $20.2 million in salary money last year while also taking home $36 million from endorsements. With a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehkm45flmgf/1-kevin-durant/#7907cd0879c3">total haul of $56.2 million</a>, Durant is the highest-paid athlete at the Rio Olympics. As you can see in the above picture, he is well aware of his current status.

It's hard to believe there was a time when we were ever concerned about the athletes who wouldn't be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-summer-olympics-6-athletes-wont.html/">participating in the 2016 Summer Olympics</a>. Sure, selfishly we always want to watch the best of the best strut their stuff on the biggest stage. Yet, when it comes to the Rio Games, one has to think about the stakes now more than ever. This isn't about winning gold anymore, this is about something much more: one's health.

We honestly believed that by the time the Games rolled around Brazil would've gotten its act together. However, that doesn't seem to be the case. These 2016 Rio Olympics have become a liability; there really is no other way to put it. In fact, we can't remember the last time the Olympics were in this much disarray leading up to the Games themselves. But here we are in 2016, and yes, it is that bad.

No matter how you look at it, there is a laundry list of issues surrounding the Rio Games. If we chose to list them all, we'd be here for days -- possibly weeks. However, since we don't have that much time, we thought it'd be best to keep the list reasonable. With that, here's a look at the five worst things about the 2016 Rio Games so far.

<h2>1. Russian doping scandal</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673923" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673923" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thomas-Bach-FABRICE-COFFRINI-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Worst Things About the Rio Olympics So Far" width="757" height="529" /> International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach speaks about the Russian doping situation. | Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

We've seen doping scandals before, but nothing quite like the one that's going on with Russia, as a <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/460c5d841b4d4f0883e1b0d132f506f4/russian-inquiry-finds-cheating-went-beyond-sochi-olympics">recent report</a> outlined a massive "state-sanctioned doping system" going on within the country. While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/17134646/international-olympic-committee-decides-full-olympic-games-ban-russia">against fully banning the country</a> from the Rio Games, the fallout has been massive, with <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/canoe/story/_/id/17144793/at-least-85-russians-now-barred-rio-olympics-doping">at least 85 Russians officially barred</a> from these Olympics because of doping.

<h2>2. Zika</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673905" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673905" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Zap-Zika-NICHOLAS-KAMM-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Worst Things About the Rio Olympics So Far" width="757" height="549" /> "Zap Zika" for real. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

After determining that the Zika virus can cause birth defects, it was hardly a surprise when the World Health Organization declared it to be a global public health emergency. Due to legit fears of this virus, many of the world's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/0/rio-olympics-which-athletes-have-withdrawn-over-zika-fears/">top athletes have pulled out of the Rio Olympics</a>, while others have opted instead to <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/fearing-zika-virus-defending-gold-medalist-will-freeze-sperm-before-rio-2016-olympics/">freeze their sperm</a> ahead of the Games. Any way you look at it, this virus has forced extra precautions to be made.

<h2>3. Olympic Village is uninhabitable</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673868" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673868" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kitty-Chiller-VANDERLEI-ALMEIDA-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Worst Things About the Rio Olympics So Far" width="757" height="505" /> Kitty Chiller has a problem with the Olympic Village in Rio. | Vanderlei Almeida/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Although many aspects of the Olympic Village are beautiful, the conditions of the dorms is not one of them. In fact, due to electrical and plumbing problems, Australia's Olympic team leader Kitty Chiller is <a href="http://espn.go.com/olympics/story/_/id/17134751/athletes-arriving-rio-olympics-facing-plumbing-electrical-problems-village">keeping the team out of the complex</a> until the problems are fixed.

"There was a strong smell of gas in some apartments and there was 'shorting' in the electrical wiring," said Chiller. "We have been living in nearby hotels because the village is simply not safe or ready." If you ask us, the idea of things not being "safe" or "ready," sounds a whole lot like these Olympics in general.

<h2>4. No way to "catch 'em all"</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="fr">Désolé les gars pas de <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon?src=hash">#pokemon</a> dans le village Olympique <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash">#Rio2016</a> &#x1f62d;&#x1f62d;&#x1f62d; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonGO?src=hash">#PokemonGO</a> <a href="https://t.co/Pqk6AN1Zf1">pic.twitter.com/Pqk6AN1Zf1</a></p>
— Matthieu PECHE (@MatthieuPECHE) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthieuPECHE/status/757412787756888064">July 25, 2016</a></blockquote>
For all of the "real" problems associated with the Rio Games, it's crazy to think that one of the recent complaints would center around an actual game. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case.

<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/olympian-says-worst-part-of-scrutinized-rio-olympic-village-is-no-pokemon-go/">According to one Olympian</a>, American diver Abby Johnston, the worst part about Olympic Village is that there is no Pokémon GO -- the horror! Of course, we can't be certain that this is an genuine complaint, however, given how quickly this game has turned into an obsession, we wouldn't be surprised. The fact is, when you "gotta catch 'em all" you "gotta catch 'em all.

<h2>5. The water is crap -- literally</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673914" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673914" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Super-Bacteria-in-Rio-Mario-Tama-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Worst Things About the Rio Olympics So Far" width="757" height="478" /> Apparently, "Super Bacteria" is a thing. | Mario Tama/Getty Images[/caption]

Just when we thought that the water at the Rio Games couldn't get any worse, we learned that it actually did -- <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/report-athletes-at-rio-olympics-will-literally-be-swimming-in-human-crap/" target="_blank">get worse</a>. Per a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/world/americas/brazil-rio-water-olympics.html?_r=1">report from the New York Times</a>, recent tests have shown that the water is "full of diarrhea-causing rotaviruses and drug-resistant 'super bacteria.'"

"Foreign athletes will literally be swimming in human crap, and they risk getting sick from all those microorganisms," local pediatrician Dr. Daniel Becker told the Times. "It's sad, but also worrisome."

'Super bacteria' and crap -- yeah, good luck with that.

		<description><![CDATA[As Team USA looks to defend its gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, here's a look at how we would rank the USA men's basketball teams dating back to 1972.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_675105" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675105" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Team-USA-2012-TIMOTHY-A.-CLARY-AFP-GettyImages.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="492" /> That's gold for Team USA in 2012 | Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

For <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-things-rio-olympics.html/">all the problems</a> still facing the 2016 Rio Olympics, the biggest disaster of them all would be if the USA men's basketball team didn't come away with the gold medal. Granted, we may be exaggerating, but we can't help it. When it comes to a group of the best basketball players on the planet -- at least the ones who didn't bail on their country (sorry) -- there is no excuse not to come home victorious. Especially when history has shown us that this is what Team USA basketball is supposed to do.

Although we believe the 2016 squad <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/rio-olympics-reasons-coach-team-usa.html/">deserves to have a little fun</a>, in the end, all we care about is that this group wins gold. It's really that simple. After all, no one wants to be on the squad that fell short on the grandest international stage. Talk about embarrassing.

Truth be told, as much as we believe in this particular Team USA men's basketball team, we have no idea how it will play out. The only thing we do know, however, is that based on pure talent alone, this squad has a chance to be one of the best USA men's basketball teams in history. So, as we get closer to the start of the 2016 Games, we thought we'd take this opportunity to rank the best men's basketball teams in American history. Dating back to 1972, this is what we came up with.
<h2>10. 2004 Summer Olympics (Athens)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_546600" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-546600 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2004-Mens-Olympic-basketball-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-e1436360364562.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="558" /> Team USA was not happy in 2004 | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxviiith-olympiad-2004.aspx">2004 USA men's basketball team</a> is probably the most disappointing group ever assembled. Despite a roster made up of superstars like LeBron James, Allen Iverson, Tim Duncan, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade, this team averaged just 88.1 points per game, finished with a 5-3 record (including losing its opening game in group play to Puerto Rico by 19 points), and only wound up winning the bronze medal. Not a good look for coach Larry Brown and Team USA basketball.

<h2>9. 1988 Summer Olympics (Seoul)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qveApg1A8Es"></iframe>

Like the 2004 squad, the <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxivth-olympiad-1988.aspx">1988 USA men's team</a> was only good enough to finish in third place, topping Australia in the bronze medal game 78-49. Of course, if you look at the numbers closely, you'll see that this group wasn't as bad as where it ended up.

Although USA lost to the USSR in the semifinals by a score of 82-76, this was the only time the squad experienced defeat in '88. This USA team, under the guidance of John Thompson, would finish with a 7-1 record, put up just under 92 points per contest, and outscored the opposition by a little over 30 points a game. Unfortunately, sometimes all it takes is one loss to ruin a good thing.

<h2>8. 1972 Summer Olympics (Munich)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTGYcCLVMuY"></iframe>

The <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxth-olympiad-1972.aspx">1972</a> USA men's basketball team will always be known for playing -- and losing -- in the most controversial game in the history of international basketball. Despite multiple issues with the clock and mass confusion, the United States fell to the Soviets 51-50 on a last-second layup. After a failed protest by the US, the Soviets were awarded the gold medals while the team from America unanimously agreed not to accept their silver medals.

<h2>7. 1976 Summer Olympics (Montreal)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675110" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675110" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1976-Summer-Olympics-Tony-Duffy-Allsport-Getty-Images-640x442.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="523" /> Opening Ceremony of the 1976 Summer Olympics | Tony Duffy/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

Under the leadership of former North Carolina coach Dean Smith, the <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxist-olympiad-1976.aspx">1976 USA men's basketball team</a> went to Montreal with one goal in mind: to regain its status as the best basketball team in the world. It did just that.Behind Adrian Dantley's 19.3 points and 5.7 rebounds per game, the US stormed through the tournament on its way to a 7-0 mark and a 95-77 victory over Team Canada in the gold medal game.

<h2>6. 2000 Summer Olympics (Sydney)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_554708" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-554708 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Vince-Carter-Jed-JacobsohnAllsportGetty-Images.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="520" /> Vince Carter literally took flight in 2000 | Jed Jacobsohn/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

When we think of the <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxviith-olympiad-2000.aspx">2000 USA squad</a>, we're reminded of Vince Carter's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/throwback-throwdowns-vince-carter-flies-international.html/?">ridiculous dunk over France's Frederic Weis</a>. However, this group was so much more than a single moment (no matter how unbelievable it was).

At the Sydney Games, Team USA went 8-0, averaged 95 points per game, and shot 51.9% from the field collectively. Oh, and of course, they took care of business in the gold medal game, defeating France by the score of 87-75.

<h2>5. 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tduwGvIv9U"></iframe>

Although the competition wasn't as great in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the USA men's basketball team still sent a clear message to the rest of the world: it would not be denied. With Michael Jordan leading the way with 17.1 points a night, the United States went 8-0, shot 55.7% from the field, and beat up the opposition by 32 points per game. They went on to defeat Spain in the gold medal game by the score of 96-65.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. 2008 Summer Olympics (Beijing)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhpVE5Yfvhc"></iframe>

After an embarrassing display in 2004, the <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxixth-olympiad-2008.aspx">2008 USA men's basketball squad</a>, dubbed the "Redeem Team" had no intention of falling short in Beijing. It's safe to say that this group achieved its goal.

Capped by an unbelievable performance by Kobe Bryant in the gold medal game, which resulted in a 118-107 victory over Spain, the US would finish the tournament with an 8-0 mark while putting up 106.2 points per game and defeating the opposition by 27.8 points per night. Yeah, USA basketball was officially back and better than ever.

<h2>3. 1996 Summer Olympics (Atlanta)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674960" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674960" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Team-USA-1996-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images-640x425.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="503" /> It was good to be Team USA in 1996 | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Although the expectations coming into <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxvith-olympiad-1996.aspx">1996 Olympics in Atlanta</a> were high, Team USA was more than capable of meeting them. Coached by Lenny Wilkins and led by Charles Barkley, David Robinson, and Scottie Pippen, this group went 8-0, outscored its opponents by almost 32 points per game, and took home the top prize, defeating Yugoslavia 95-69 in the gold medal game.
<h2><!--nextpage-->2. 2012 Summer Olympics (London)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OBZhxQoz6T4"></iframe>

What the <a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxxth-olympiad-2012.aspx">2012 USA men's team</a> did in London was nothing short of spectacular. This group entered the Olympics as the heavy favorite, and all it did was put on a special show.

This US team put up a ridiculous 115.5 points per game, had five players averaging in double digits in scoring (with Kevin Durant leading the way at 19.5 points a night), and crushed its opponents by 32.1 points a game. Did Team USA men's basketball come away with gold? You better believe it.

<h2>1. 1992 Summer Olympics (Barcelona)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657887" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Michael-Jordan-and-Magic-Johnson-KARL-MATHIS-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ranking the Best USA Men's Basketball Teams" width="757" height="486" /> Michael Jordan (L) and Magic Johnson during a press conference for the US Olympic "Dream Team" | KARL MATHIS/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The 1992 "<a href="http://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxvth-olympiad-1992.aspx">Dream Team</a>" is the USA men's basketball squad by which all others are measured. And this group, led by his Airness, Sir Charles, Larry Bird, and Magic Johnson, didn't just dominate in Barcelona, they put on a show unlike the world has ever seen before.

On it's way to the gold medal (duh), the 1992 USA men's basketball team averaged 117.3 points per game, won all eight of its contests, and outscored its opponents by an unheard of 43.8 points per game. Said the team's head coach Chuck Daly: "You will see a team of professionals in the Olympics again. But I don't think you'll see another team quite like this. This was a majestic team." We couldn't agree more.

The Olympic Games provide us with the perfect opportunity to enjoy the beauty of competition while celebrating the love for our country. Just as it is with pro sports, not everyone has what it takes to reach this particular level. And as we learned from <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-summer-olympics-talking-rio-with-dara-torres.html/" target="_blank">speaking with Olympian Dara Torres</a>, the opportunity to showcase one's skill at this event is something that hopefuls should not take for granted. Participating in the 2016 Summer Games at Rio is a big deal. Just ask those who won't be able to do so.

Every four years we get to witness some of the best athletes on the planet come together in the ultimate global competition. This time around, the Games are heading to Brazil. Unfortunately, some of the most popular athletes in the world will not be along for the ride. For us, the absence of these six individuals will be felt the most.
<h2>1. Chris Paul</h2>
[caption id="attachment_632958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632958" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Chris-Paul-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Image.jpg" alt="2016 Summer Olympics: 6 Athletes Who Won't Be There" width="757" height="563" /> Chris Paul waits for the play to begin. | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

After winning gold medals with Team USA in 2008 and 2012, Los Angeles Clippers point guard <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/chris-paul/" target="_blank">Chris Paul</a> decided to <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/2016/03/29/chris-paul-team-usa-2016-rio-olympics-roster-clippers" target="_blank">withdraw his name from consideration</a> for the Rio Games. While speaking with SI.com's Lee Jenkins about this difficult choice, Paul had this to say: "I feel my body telling me that I could use the time." Considering he fractured a bone in his hand during these 2016 playoffs, we think Paul has a point. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Team USA is super deep at the point guard position.

It clearly shows that Paul is grateful for his past Olympic experience. "What we do is such a small thing compared to what the people do who protect our freedom," he told SI.com. "But when I put on that USA jersey it always gave me goose bumps because you realized you were part of something so much bigger than yourself."

Despite a 2015-16 season in which he averaged <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/davisan02.html" target="_blank">24.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game</a>, New Orleans Pelicans center <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/anthony-davis/" target="_blank">Anthony Davis</a> spent most of the year dealing with nagging injuries to both his knee and shoulder. And while he'd love to suit up for Team USA this summer, getting healthy was priority No. 1. As a result, The Brow will need four to five months of recovery time after <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/anthony-davis-to-miss-rest-of-season-with-knee--back-woes-211555709.html" target="_blank">opting for surgeries to address these issues</a>.

"That's tough. It's definitely tough," Davis said. "Twenty-three years old ... [I've got] a couple more Olympics, maybe? It's definitely a tough situation. I love USA Basketball [...] It was definitely a tough decision, but I think everybody understands where health is more important than [being] on the court." Overcoming Davis' absence will be difficult for Team USA. However, we agree, nothing is more important than his long-term health. Still, this one's going to hurt.

For the first time since 1904, golf is heading back to the Olympics. Unfortunately, one of the sport's biggest names, Australia's Adam Scott, <a href="http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/adam-scott-chooses-not-compete-2016-olympics-rio" target="_blank">will not be participating in the 2016 Games</a>. Said Scott: "My decision has been taken as a result of an extremely busy playing schedule around the time of the Olympics and other commitments, both personal and professional." While we understand this decision, it really is a shame. This event could've used the participation of the <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.24502.html" target="_blank">No. 7-ranked player in the world</a>.

<h2>4. Blake Griffin</h2>

As much as we would've enjoyed watching Blake Griffin showcase his incredibly athleticism against international competition, like Clippers teammate CP3, he will be forced to miss the Rio Games this summer <a href="http://www.nba.com/2016/news/05/06/los-angeles-clippers-blake-griffin-wont-participate-in-team-usa-training-camps/index.html?cid=nbacomsocial_tw_sf25823312" target="_blank">after undergoing bone marrow procedure</a> on his left quad tendon. This news really is too bad. We had always hoped Griffin would be the next player to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/throwback-throwdowns-vince-carter-flies-international.html/" target="_blank">completely jump over a defender</a> at the Olympic Games. We guess there's always 2020.

<h2>5. Lionel Messi</h2>
[caption id="attachment_641377" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-641377" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Lionel-Messi-Alex-Caparros-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 Summer Olympics: 6 Athletes Who Won't Be There" width="757" height="503" /> Barcelona's Lionel Messi looks on during a match. | Alex Caparros/Getty Images[/caption]

Lionel Messi is easily one of the two best soccer players on the planet. And yet, instead of having the magician participate in the 2016 Games, Argentina coach Gerardo Martino has decided that Messi will <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/7331/lionel-messi/2016/05/09/23324322/lionel-messi-disappointed-to-miss-olympics-in-rio" target="_blank">only suit up at Copa America Centenario</a>.

"I would have liked to go because it was a spectacular experience for me to play in the [2008] Olympics, just as it was for the [2005] U20 World Cup," Messi told ESPN. "Not just because we won, but for the experience I gained.

"It was a great experience to stay in the Olympic Village and meet other elite athletes from other sports and to be just another athlete among them; that was very spectacular even though we didn't spend a lot of time in the village."

Contrary to popular belief, we think there is something special about watching soccer during the Olympics. And yet, it's safe to say that without Messi on the pitch, some of that magic will clearly be lost.

Although this past season wasn't filled with vintage Mamba, we were <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dear-kobe-a-farewell-letter-to-one-of-the-nbas-best.html/" target="_blank">so grateful</a> for all the time we got to watch <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/kobe-bryant/" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> do his thing on the basketball court. And just as his time in the NBA has come to an end, so has participating in Olympic competition. After removing his name from consideration for these 2016 Games, Bryant <a href="http://www.nba.com/2016/news/01/16/kobe-bryant-withdraws-from-2016-olympics-consideration.ap/" target="_blank">had this to say</a>:

"Since my retirement announcement, I'm able to watch these guys in a different light. I've come to terms with the fact that they are the future of this game. These are the guys who deserve the spots in Rio. These are the guys who people need to watch and root for. These are the guys to show fans where this game is going in the future."

Only one thing left to say at this point: "Mamba out."

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_611359" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611359" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/McGregor-and-Diaz-Rey-Del-Rio-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="5 Fights With the Most Pay-Per-View Buys in UFC History" width="757" height="505" /> Rey Del Rio/Getty Images[/caption]

Contrary to popular belief, sports are completely unpredictable. Whether it's a team game or an individual competition, the favorites aren't always destined to win. In athletics, the possibility of an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-sports-upsets-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">unbelievable upset</a> is part of the reason we keep coming back for more. And as UFC fans are well aware, UFC 196 featured the sort of shocking upset that most probably didn't see coming: The <a href="http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/14912466/nate-diaz-defeats-conor-mcgregor-submission-second-round-ufc-196-main-event" target="_blank">defeat of UFC featherweight champion</a> Conor McGregor.

While McGregor did move up to a higher weight class to take on Nate Diaz, who wasn't even his original opponent, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that the brash Irishman would still handle his business. Yet, even though he lost by submission, you have to give McGregor some credit.

He handled his defeat with dignity and grace. "I took the chance in going up to 170," said McGregor. "I was inefficient with my energy. I'm humbled in victory and defeat. He took the fight on short notice and done the job. He was efficient. I was not. These things happen. I'll learn, and I'll grow. I'll face it like a man."

For a person as driven and competitive as McGregor, we're sure the loss will sting for a little while. However, at least he didn't leave Las Vegas empty handed. As noted by Forbes, McGregor will <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2016/03/05/cha-ching-conor-mcgregor-will-get-record-purse-for-ufc-196/#de4eb81969f1" target="_blank">receive a record purse</a> of $1 million for the fight. Of course, that figure will go up once the revenue generated from the most pay-per-view buys comes in.

The question is: How much will that end up being? We may not know the answer to that right now, but we do know which events throughout the sport's existence have had the most pay-per-view buys. Here's a look at the five biggest draws in UFC history.
<h2>5. UFC 91, November 2008</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pay-per-view buys</span>: 1.01 million

UFC 91 featured a heavyweight title bout between the then-champion Randy Couture and a man who will be featured multiple times on this list, Brock Lesnar. While ultimate fighting fans probably know that Lesnar went home victorious thanks to a second-round TKO, they may not be aware that while he <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ffeh45ijmh/5-ufc-91-november-2/" target="_blank">earned $450,000</a> for winning the contest, according to Forbes, this fight also generated 1,010,000 pay-per-view buys. Of course, if that figure doesn't impress you, fear not. We're just getting started.

<h2>4. UFC 168, December 2013</h2>
[caption id="attachment_611365" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611365" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chris-Weidman-Brad-Barket-Getty-Images-for-Reebok-632x500.jpg" alt="5 Fights With the Most Pay-Per-View Buys in UFC History" width="757" height="599" /> Brad Barket/Getty Images for Reebok[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pay-per-view buys</span>: 1.025 million

Fans at home who shelled out the cash for UFC 168 were treated to something special: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ffeh45ijmh/4-ufc-168-december/" target="_blank">two for the price of one</a>. This event, which took place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, featured a rematch between reigning middleweight champion Chris Weidman -- who would come out victorious (again) -- and Anderson "The Spider" Silva, as well as a women’s bantamweight fight between then-champion Ronda Rousey and Miesha Tate (the former won). Aside from garnering 1,025,000 pay-per-view buys, this event also earned $6.2 million from the gate revenue, the second-most in the history of the sport.
<h2>3. UFC 66, December 2006</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pay-per-view buys</span>: 1.05 million

At UFC 66, when Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell squared off in the octagon, who could've imagined the sort of response it would get. With a third-round knockout, Liddell was crowned the light heavyweight champion, and the sport would topple the standing record for live gate revenue by $2,000,000, while also securing the third most pay-per-view buys at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ffeh45ijmh/3-ufc-66-december-2/" target="_blank">1,050,000</a>. Even back in 2006, the UFC was clearly on its way to becoming much-watch entertainment.

<h2>2. UFC 116, July 2010</h2>
[caption id="attachment_611367" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611367" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Brock-Lesnar-Jon-Kopaloff-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="5 Fights With the Most Pay-Per-View Buys in UFC History" width="757" height="504" /> Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pay-per-view buys</span>: 1.06 million

Once again, at UFC 116, Lesnar (above right) took his talents to the octagon. And surprising no one, the folks at home threw down the cash to watch the action. Lesnar defeated Shane Carwin in the second round by submission, and the UFC came away with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ffeh45ijmh/2-ufc-116-july-2010/" target="_blank">1,060,000 pay-per-view buys</a>. When it came to these two forces of nature finally facing off, clearly the third time was the charm.
<h2>1. UFC 100, July 2009</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Pay-Per-View buys</span>: 1.06 million

We told you Lesnar would dominate this list, and we meant it. Per Forbes, UFC 100, which featured the heavyweight fight (pictured above) between Lesnar and Frank Mir -- as well as the welterweight showdown between Georges St-Pierre and Thiago Alves -- brought in the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ffeh45ijmh/1-ufc-100-july-2009/" target="_blank">most pay-per-view buys in UFC history</a>. Given the popularity of the sport, we have a feeling it's only a matter of time before this record is broken. The only question is: Who will be the ones to take the crown?

		<description><![CDATA[The UFC has been staging exciting fights since 1993. Here are 15 of the greatest fights in the storied history of the promotion.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_743431" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743431" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jon-Jones.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Jon Jones | Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

The UFC held its first event on November 12, 1993. The fight card, a one-night tournament, drew 7,800 fans to the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colo. Royce Gracie, who submitted Gerard Gordeau, won that tournament. On Saturday night, the promotion held its 352nd event, drawing 9,552 fans to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Brisbane, Australia to see Mark Hunt knock out Frank Mir in the main event.

Between those two events, the promotion has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ufc-the-5-best-fights-that-never-happened.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">staged thousands of fights</a>; some have been good, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ufc-9-fights-that-pissed-us-off-royally.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">some have been bad</a>, and some turned into the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ufc-the-5-biggest-title-fight-upsets-in-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">most memorable bouts in combat sports history</a>. When considering what fights made this most memorable list, we considered a number of factors, including the importance of the fight to the promotion, the manner in which the fight was won (or lost), and if the fight could <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-fights-with-the-most-pay-per-view-buys-in-ufc-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">stand up to repeated viewings</a>.

What follows are the 15 greatest fights in the history of the UFC. If you’ve seen these fights before, watch them again; if you haven’t seen them, well, set aside some time because you really need to see these historical battles inside the Octagon. In the future, new fights may dislodge a lower-ranked fight from this list — after all, there are some recent fights that are highly ranked in the top 15 UFC fights of all time.

<h2>15. Forrest Griffin vs. Quinton Jackson: UFC 86</h2>
[caption id="attachment_957458" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-957458" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Forrest-Griffin.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="510" /> Forrest Griffin (L) fighting Andersion Silva | Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images[/caption]

This fight was the second title defense of Quinton “Rampage” Jackson’s UFC light heavyweight championship reign. In this contest, Forrest Griffin’s goal was to stick and move, keeping Jackson at distance. Griffin did just that early on, but as the first round wore on, Jackson’s power caught him on two occasions — he even got dropped to the mat. In the second round, Griffin buckled Jackson’s leg with a kick, and when Jackson moved in for a takedown he found himself under Griffin on the mat. Griffin spent the rest of the round in control of Jackson on the ground.

The third round was fairly uneventful, which allowed Jackson to recover from the leg kicks that hurt him earlier in the fight. With that being said, Griffin still kept Jackson at distance, which prevented him from scoring with his strikes. In the fourth round, Jackson was able to close the distance and land some strikes, opening up a cut over Griffin’s right eye.

After landing those strikes, Jackson took the fight to the ground, but he found himself briefly caught in a triangle choke by Griffin. In the final round, Jackson was unable to close the distance, which prevented him from making a late run for the stoppage. When the cards were read, Griffin captured the title by unanimous decision, only to lose the title in his next outing — by TKO to Rashad Evans.
<h2>14. Randy Couture vs. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira: UFC 102</h2>
Randy Couture entered this fight coming off a loss to Brock Lesnar, a fight in which Lesnar captured the UFC heavyweight title. As for Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, he too lost his last fight, getting TKO-ed by Frank Mir and losing the interim UFC heavyweight championship. There was not much going on in this fight until Nogueira knocked Couture down with a big right hand with three minutes left in the first round.

Once the fight was on the ground, Nogueira, a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, gave his best effort to choke Couture out, but Couture was able to fight off the submission attempt. In the second round, Couture tried to work ground and pound, but Nogueira easily reversed and went for an arm triangle choke, which Couture was avoided, but he remained under Nogueira.

Things became even more bleak for Couture in the third round when he knocked Couture to the ground and positively assaulted him with ground and pound. Couture was able to reverse, but he was unable to capitalize on that reversal. Nogueira took the fight, which won “Fight of the Night” by unanimous decision.

<h2>13. Diego Sanchez vs. Karo Parisyan: UFC Fight Night 6</h2>
[caption id="attachment_957456" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-957456" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diego-Sanchez.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Diego Sanchez | Rey Del Rio/Getty Images[/caption]

This 2006 fight between highly ranked welterweights Diego Sanchez and Karo Parisyan went to the ground early. Sanchez had Parisyan in trouble as he went for submissions, opening a cut under Parisyan’s eye. Meanwhile, Parisyan let Sanchez know that he would have to be aware of his world-class judo throws. Round two opened with Parisyan using his hands to back Sanchez into the cage, where he picked Sanchez up and dumped him to the mat.

Later in the round, Sanchez gained a takedown of his own and worked to land as many strikes as he possibly could. The third round had a little bit of everything from Sanchez; brutal strikes, submission attempts, and most of all, an overwhelming desire to keep control of the fight. When this “Fight of the Night” came to a close, it was a clear win for Sanchez who remained unbeaten at 16-0.
<h2>12. Matt Hughes vs. B.J. Penn II: UFC 63</h2>
The first time Matt Hughes met B.J. Penn in the Octagon was UFC 46. Hughes lost that fight, and his UFC welterweight title, submitting to a rear-naked choke in the first round. The rematch came more than two years late, and once again Hughes held the UFC welterweight title. For the first two rounds it looked like Penn was on his way to recapturing his title, even threatening a submission for the final 30 seconds of the second round.

When the round ended, Penn was winded, and the look on his face when the third round began didn’t inspire any confidence. Hughes noticed this and looked to dominate Penn on the ground, which he did, putting Penn in the crucifix position and assaulting him with strikes, bringing referee John McCarthy in to stop the fight at the 3:53 mark. This fight also goes down as the night that Georges St-Pierre walked into the Octagon and uttered the infamous line, “I am not impressed by your performance.”

<h2>11. Chuck Liddell vs. Wanderlei Silva: UFC 79</h2>
[caption id="attachment_957453" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-957453" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Chuck-Liddell.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="529" /> Fighter ‘Sugar’ Shane Mosley (L) and MMA fighter Chuck Liddell | Marc Serota/Getty Images[/caption]

Fans had clamored for this fight for a long time; the problem being that these two light heavyweight beasts had been competing in different organizations — Chuck Liddell in the UFC and Wanderlei Silva in PRIDE. When the two circled each other for the first two minutes, UFC commentator Joe Rogan said, “These are two dogs that have been staring at each other through the fence for a long time.”

The first round was mostly circling and feinting, but with 1:20 left, things picked up, and by that we mean these two started throwing punches intended to take each other’s heads off. Things loosened up in the second round, with Silva landing his punches and kicks, but the tide turned with 1:15 left when Liddell forced Silva to the cage and threw everything he had at Silva, who returned the favor. With 30 seconds left in the round, the two bloodied fighters stood and exchanged punched until Liddell took the fight to the ground.

Liddell owned the third round, using two takedowns to secure his victory while taking every opportunity afforded him to land strikes when he could. The fight, which won “Fight of the Night,” was the last victory of Liddell’s career, he lost his next three fights and retire from the UFC. Silva fought eight more times for the UFC, going 4-4 over that time. Silva is currently signed with Bellator.
<h2> 10. Tim Sylvia vs. Randy Couture: UFC 68</h2>
Couture announced his retirement in February 2006 after losing to Liddell at UFC 52. In March 2007, Couture returned to the Octagon to face Tim Sylvia for Sylvia’s heavyweight title. Entering the fight, Sylvia was 13 years younger than Couture and had a six-inch height advantage and an almost 12-inch reach advantage. Oh, and he weighed 40.5 pounds more than Couture. In short, the older, shorter, lighter Couture was at a huge disadvantage — at least on paper.

All those advantages went out the window within the first 10 seconds of the fight as Couture blitzed Sylvia, knocking him down with a big right hand and looking for the finish before taking Sylvia’s back, where he spent the remainder of the round. Couture also controlled the second round, taking Sylvia to the mat before working ground and pound inside the guard of his much larger opponent.

The third round also belonged to Couture, who picked apart his much bigger opponent on the feet. Sylvia seemed unable to use his height and reach advantage. The fourth and fifth rounds were more of the same; Couture used his takedowns and ground game to dominate Sylvia. When the fight came to a close, everyone in the arena was on their feet applauding the dominant performance that Couture put forth to capture the heavyweight title. When Couture got the mic at the end of the fight, he said, “Not bad for an old man.” Truer words were never spoken inside the Octagon.

<h2>9. Diego Sanchez vs. Clay Guida: The Ultimate Fighter 9 Finale</h2>
[caption id="attachment_957457" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-957457" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Diego-Sanchez2.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Diego Sanchez (L) punches Jim Miller. | Rey Del Rio/Getty Images[/caption]

Something you should be aware of: Whenever Diego Sanchez or Clay Guida step into the Octagon you will see some of the most intense dudes in MMA. So a fight that features both of them, well that will be bonkers. These two ran directly to the center of the Octagon and just started unloading punches at each other. Commentator Joe Rogan didn’t even try to call the action, he just repeated, “Oh my God, Oh my God.”

The first minute was pure aggression with Sanchez getting the best of the exchanges, bloodying Guida, who eventually found an opening in the attack and took the fight to the ground. When the fight went back to standing, Sanchez dropped Guida with a head kick, but he didn’t stay down for long, getting back to his feet only to get smashed again by the strikes of Sanchez.

Guida was able to get the fight to the ground early in the second round, eating elbows from the bottom for his effort before landing some ground and pound of his own. Things slowed down in the third and final round, but the two still threw punches with bad intentions. When the results were read for this “Fight of the Night” winning contest, Sanchez took the win via split decision.
<h2>8. Matt Hughes vs. Frank Trigg II: UFC 52</h2>
The first time Matt Hughes and Frank Trigg met, Hughes defended his UFC welterweight title by stopping Trigg via a standing rear-naked choke. Less than two years later, the two met again. Things were tense from the get-go in this one, as Trigg stepped into Hughes during the staredown, which resulted in Hughes shoving Trigg and Trigg blowing Hughes a kiss as he backed into his corner before the start of the action.

Early in this fight, the two tied up along the cage and Trigg landed an accidental knee to the groin of Hughes. Referee Mario Yamasaki responded to the blow by telling Trigg to watch his knees. Meanwhile, Hughes was obviously distracted by the shot. However, since the referee did not stop the action, Trigg fought on, taking advantage of the situation and putting Hughes to the ground where he tried to end the fight. Hughes was able to weather the storm, even fighting off a deep choke attempt.

Once Hughes slipped free from the choke, he got to his feet, lifted Trigg off his feet, and ran him across the cage, slamming him to the ground where he mounted Trigg and rained down elbows. Trigg gave up his back and Hughes sank in the rear-naked choke for the submission win at 4:05 of the first round. The fight was one of the best one-round fights in UFC history, and a good example of just how resilient and tough Hughes was during his prime.

<h2>7. Mark Hunt vs. Antonio Silva 1: UFC Fight Night 33</h2>
[caption id="attachment_893612" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-893612" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mark-Hunt.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="554" /> Mark Hunt | David Mariuz/Getty Images[/caption]

If you want to see two extremely large men try to knock each other out cold for 25 straight minutes, this is a must-see fight. The first half of the first round didn’t have a lot of action, but when these two decided to open up, the fists began flying, and Antonio Silva got the best of things, briefly putting Mark Hunt onto the mat with a short right hand. Silva hurt Hunt again in the second round, landing a brutal leg kick to Hunt’s calf, which forced him to switch his stance.

In the third round, Hunt briefly gained a takedown, but the fight quickly went back to the feet. With a little more than two minutes left in the round, Hunt dropped Silva with a right and worked for the finish with ground and pound. Silva looked like he was running out of gas in the fourth round, but he was still able to land some leg kicks that hurt Hunt. However, Hunt was relentless, taking Silva to the mat. When they stood, Hunt threw some heavy elbows that cut Silva, but Silva responded with a brutal striking assault that backed Hunt into the cage.

With 1:45 left in the round, Silva took the fight to the mat, and he gained full mount, bloodying Hunt with strikes. At one point it looked, and sounded, like the referee was going to wave off the fight. Neither fighter looked like they had anything left in the final round, but that didn’t stop them from throwing heavy hands. Hunt got the best of this round, throwing punches to the head and body before the referee paused the fight to look at the gash on Silva’s head.

The doctor allowed the fight to continue, and continue it did, with the clearly exhausted fighters doing whatever they could to gain the finish. When the fight came to an end, it was scored a majority draw, and somehow, that felt right. Unfortunately, Silva <a href="http://www.mmafighting.com/2013/12/17/5222148/bigfoot-silva-suspended-stripped-of-bonus-after-failing-post-fight" target="_blank">failed his post-fight drug test</a>, forfeiting his portion of the “Fight of the Night” bonus and receiving a nine-month suspension.

<h2>6. Jon Jones vs. Alexander Gustafsson: UFC 165</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743437" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743437" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jon-Bones-Jones.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Jon Jones | Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

The promotion of this fight was, shall we say, cheesy. The UFC basically went with, “These guys are both tall,” when promoting Jon Jones’ sixth UFC light heavyweight title defense. Had they known how competitive this fight would be, they would have undoubtedly used a different angle.

The first round was a sign that Jones, a nine-to-one favorite going into the bout, was in for a fight. Alexander Gustafsson cut Jones with a right hand early in the round and was able to take him down, something Jones’ previous UFC opponents had failed to do in 16 attempts. Jones picked up his pace in the second round, but Gustafsson never backed down from Jones’ striking attacks.

By the time the fifth and final round came around, Jones’ face was a bloody, puffy mess. The champion remained aggressive, though, and took control of the fight, gaining the unanimous decision win. If there were questions about Jones’ heart or Gustafsson’s toughness heading into this fight, they were answered in this bout.
<h2> 5. Frankie Edgar vs. Gray Maynard III: UFC 136</h2>
The first time Frankie Edgar and Gray Maynard met, in 2008, Maynard earned a unanimous decision win. The second time these two met, in January 2011, it was for Frankie Edgar’s UFC lightweight belt. After five rounds of action, the fight ended in a draw. About 10 months after that fight, the two met for a third time, in the main event of UFC 136. Edgar was holding his own in the first round until Maynard landed an uppercut with 2:35 left in the round that rocked Edgar, but failed to put him out.

With 1:40 left, things got worse for Edgar when he was dropped by Maynard, who then went for the kill, throwing everything he had at a bloodied and dazed Edgar. The assault left UFC commentator Mike Goldberg wondering, “What is keeping him standing?” When the second round started, Maynard couldn’t get close to Edgar, who kept him at a distance with his boxing, giving himself time to recover from the beating he took in the first round.

The third round was more of the same from Edgar. By the fourth round, Edgar showed his movement and footwork, taking over the fight. With 1:15 left in the fourth stanza, it was Edgar’s turn to damage his opponent with an uppercut — the difference being that once Edgar hurt Maynard, he was able to put the fight away, landing several rights before wrapping things up with lefts on the ground. The final result of the “Knockout of the Night”-winning fight was a KO at 3:54 of the fourth round.

<h2>4. Dan Henderson vs. Mauricio Rua: UFC 139</h2>
[caption id="attachment_957454" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-957454" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dan-Henderson.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="757" height="500" /> Dan Henderson | Valerie Macon/Getty Images[/caption]

The five-round striking war between Dan Henderson and Mauricio Rua heated up within the first minute of the first round, leaving Rua’s face bloodied. Henderson was aggressive through the first three rounds, pushing the pace and looking for the knockout throughout, but especially during the third round when he dropped Rua with a huge right hand. He wasn’t able to put Rua away, but he did a lot of damage with his ground and pound.

Henderson used a huge amount of energy going for the third-round knockout, and by the midpoint of the fourth stanza it was clear that Henderson’s tank was empty. With Henderson depleted, Rua did his best to pound out the win in the fifth and final round, but Henderson took everything his opponent could offer and survived those final five minutes to get the win.

After the fight, neither man could attend the press conference as they had to both go to the hospital. This fight was a great performance by both men, and an excellent return to the UFC for Henderson, who had spent the two previous years fighting for Strikeforce. After the fight, UFC president Dana White <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/11/ufc-139-dana-white-says-henderson-vs-rua-one-of-best-fights-ever.html" target="_blank">declared the bout one of the top three fights</a> in the history of the promotion.
<h2>3. Robbie Lawler vs. Rory MacDonald 2: UFC 189</h2>
The 2015 fight between Robbie Lawler and Rory MacDonald was both a rematch and the first defense of Lawler’s UFC welterweight title reign. The first fight between these two, in 2013, ended in a split decision victory for Lawler. The first round of this rematch was fairly even, but Lawler began to find his range near the end of the first stanza, bloodying MacDonald badly with his strikes.

Despite his badly damaged nose, MacDonald kept moving forward, throwing and landing strikes of his own. Lawler looked excellent at the beginning of the third round, showing a lot of movement and landing brutal blows, mostly to the face of his opponent. However, as the third round came to a close, MacDonald turned the fight to his advantage, badly hurting Lawler with a head kick and strikes against the fence.

At the start of the fourth round, it was all MacDonald, who again hurt Lawler, mixing up his strikes and coming at Lawler from all angles with punches, kicks, and elbows. By this point, both fighters looked like they had run face first into a brick wall multiple times. When the round ended the two stood in the center of the Octagon and stared each other down, their vision clouded by blood.

When the final round began it was anybody’s fight to win. One minute into the fifth round, Lawler made it his fight when he literally crushed MacDonald’s nose. The strike dropped MacDonald to the mat in pain. The fight took home “Fight of the Night” honors and many MMA outlets named it 2015’s best MMA fight, with UFC president Dana White calling it, “<a href="The%20fight of the ever" target="_blank">The fight of the ever</a>.”

<h2>2. Anderson Silva vs. Chael Sonnen: UFC 117</h2>
[caption id="attachment_754366" align="aligncenter" width="759"]<img class="wp-image-754366" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Anderson-Silva.jpg" alt="UFC: 15 of the Greatest Fights of All Time" width="759" height="534" /> Anderson Silva | Steve Marcus/Getty Images[/caption]

The lead-up to this one was nasty, with plenty of trash talk from Chael Sonnen. However, as soon as the first round began, it was apparent that Sonnen would be able to back up that trash talk. Sonnen hurt then-UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva several times early in the first round with strikes, and then took the fight to the ground where he was in complete control.

The second, third, fourth, and most of the fifth round involved more of the same, with Sonnen taking the fight to the mat and then looking to break down Silva with ground and pound. Over the course of the fight, Sonnen landed 320 strikes to Silva’s 64. And it looked like Silva’s reign as middleweight champion would come to an end.

However, with just two minutes left in the final round, Sonnen slipped up and allowed Silva to secure a triangle choke. Seconds after the submission hold was applied, Sonnen tapped and the title remained around the waist of Silva. The win was an incredible comeback victory. The bout won “Fight of the Night” and “Submission of the Night” honors.
<h2>1. Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar: TUF 1 Finale</h2>
This fight may be the most important contest in the history of the UFC. Without this bout there’s no telling where the UFC would be today. The matchup between Griffin and Stephan Bonnar was nothing but two light heavyweights trying to knock each other out for 15 minutes straight. When the first round ended the fighters received a standing ovation from the crowd inside the Cox Pavilion in Las Vegas. Many in the audience would not take their seats again until well after the fight ended.

By the time the second round came to a close, Griffin was a bloody mess and it was a wonder how either man had enough left in the tank to make it through another five minutes — but that’s exactly what they did. The pace slowed during the third round, but that didn’t make the fight any less entertaining. Each time one fighter looked to land a strike, the other looked for a counter. When the horn sounded to end the fight, the bloody pair of fighters raised their hands to the raucous approval of the crowd.

When the result of the fight was announced, awarding the victory to Griffin, Bonnar collapsed to the mat. The UFC thought so much of the fight that it offered UFC contracts to both fighters. Originally only the winner was going to earn a deal with the promotion. In case you don’t remember, this fight was not the main event, the headlining bout was a light heavyweight scrap between Rich Franklin and Ken Shamrock. Franklin won that fight by first round TKO. Both Griffin and Bonnar were inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2013.

		<description><![CDATA[Houston's Dwight Howard may be injured at the moment, but that's not going to keep him from looking fresh. Who are the best dressed famous athletes?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_758705" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758705" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dwight-Howard_bow-tie-640x406.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Dressed Famous Athletes" width="757" height="480" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Nowadays, more than ever, sports and style go hand-in-hand. Athletes are extremely high profile and are consistently in the spotlight. Therefore they need to make sure that their game off the playing field is as fresh as their game on it. No one emphasizes that more than one of the best dressed famous athletes, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets" target="_blank">Houston Rockets</a> center <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/2384/dwight-howard" target="_blank">Dwight Howard</a>.

It's possible that Dwight misses a game from time to time -- that doesn’t mean he can’t still look good on the bench. Howard is one of the better centers in the NBA, but he’s also proving to be one of the better dressed athletes out there. And there are plenty of players who know how to put together an outfit. In our opinion, these are the seven most stylish athletes in sports today.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/david-beckham/" target="_blank">David Beckham</a> may be an ex-professional footballer, but he’s still an English icon. And his style always matches that of his status: it’s legit. It’s a tailor-made look for a guy who knows how to sport quality clothing. It’s as if he’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000007/" target="_blank">James Bond</a>. But what else would you expect from a guy who married a <a href="http://www.thespicegirls.com/" target="_blank">Spice Girl</a>? That’s <a href="http://up.p30room.ir/uploads/13728371351.jpg" target="_blank">British royalty</a> right there.

Newton is a big guy (<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/13994/cam-newton" target="_blank">6-foot-5, 245 pounds</a>), with a big smile, who appears to enjoy himself like a big kid. He likes to mix and match (notice the bow tie and the graffitied kicks). Cam Newton is dressed to have a good time.

<h2> 3. Kevin Durant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758733" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758733" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Kevin-Durant-640x423.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Dressed Famous Athletes" width="757" height="500" /> Dave Sandford/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html" target="_blank">Kevin Durant</a> is so fluid and smooth on the basketball court. When he steps onto the floor for the <a href="http://www.nba.com/thunder/" target="_blank">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, his game is simply effortless. But when the buzzer sounds and it’s time to step out into the real world, KD’s look is just as cool. He has plenty of confidence (as he should) and he’s not afraid to go with the bold colors. This is why he’s an <a href="http://www.nba.com/history/nba-mvp-award-winners/" target="_blank">MVP</a> no matter where he is.

<h2>4. Dwyane Wade</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758739" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dwyane-Wade-640x426.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Dressed Famous Athletes" width="757" height="504" /> Erika Goldring/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wadedw01.html" target="_blank">Dwyane Wade</a> may constantly be battling with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/story/_/id/9760169/dwyane-wade-miami-heat-regrets-having-meniscus-removed-college" target="_blank">chronic knee issues</a>, but there’s never been any problems with his sense of style. The <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/mia/miami-heat" target="_blank">Miami Heat</a> legend knows how to put together an outfit. Great tux. Sleek bow tie. Cool pocket square. And a flashy watch. Wade has the gentleman look down pat. We’re sure his wife, Gabrielle Union, would agree that D Wade is totally <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201111/dwyane-wade-interview-gq-november-2011" target="_blank">GQ</a> material.

<h2>5. Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>

Footballer <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/portugal/1945/c-ronaldo" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> may seem arrogant and overly cocky, but there’s no denying that his play on the pitch backs up this attitude. He is a goal-scoring machine with incredible speed and an unbelievable touch on the ball. Plus, he is a major fashionista. Ronaldo is always dressed to impress and, most of all, he knows it. We have no problem giving the <a href="http://www.realmadrid.com/en" target="_blank">Real Madrid</a> superstar his due. He’s shown that he deserves it.

Super Bowl winner. <a href="http://www.giselebundchen.com.br/" target="_blank">Supermodel</a> wife. Superhuman? No doubt about it. <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> is Captain America. It’s the only thing that makes sense. After all, he is the quarterback for the <a href="http://www.patriots.com/" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a>. Brady can pull off any look he wants and no one’s going to question it. He also happens to have all the credibility he’ll ever need on his arm. It’s good to be Tom Brady.

<h2>7. Russell Westbrook</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758708" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758708" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Russell-Westbrook-640x426.jpg" alt="The 7 Best Dressed Famous Athletes" width="757" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

There may be no athlete on the planet more stylish than OKC point guard <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook" target="_blank">Russell Westbrook</a>. He’s seriously in a league of his own. The only thing more tight than his game on the court are the pants he rocks off of it. But he somehow makes it work. Not to mention, he can pull off the colorful shirt with ease. But his real signature look involves thick-rimmed glasses. He has many of them to go along with his many outfits. They don’t even have a prescription, but we don’t care. No script, no problem. Just keep doing you, Russ.

On Saturday, May 14, Brazil will host UFC 198, which is stacked from top to bottom with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/11-must-see-ufc-fights-in-may.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">important fights</a>. Headlining the event is a heavyweight title fight between champion Fabricio Werdum and No. 3-ranked contender Stipe Miocic. The fight will mark Werdum’s first defense of the title he won when he defeated Cain Velasquez by second-round submission in June.

The co-main event features No. 2-ranked middleweight Ronaldo “Jacare” Souza and No. 3-ranked Vitor Belfort. The winner of this bout will likely face the winner of the upcoming title fight between current champion Luke Rockhold and former champion Chris Weidman. One of the highlights of the card is the fact that longtime women’s MMA competitor Cristiane “Cyborg” Justino will make her debut in the UFC. Justino will meet Leslie Smith in a catchweight contest.

Sadly, UFC 198 lost one of its more intriguing bouts earlier this week when former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva was removed from the event due to illness. Silva, who was booked to face Uriah Hall, had to <a href="http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Anderson-Silva-Facing-46-Week-Recovery-Period-Following-Gall-Bladder-Surgery-104805" target="_blank">undergo gallbladder surgery</a>.

In all, UFC 198 features 12 fights. The main card will be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-fights-with-the-most-pay-per-view-buys-in-ufc-history.html/" target="_blank">broadcast on pay-per-view</a> while the preliminary fights will begin on UFC Fight Pass before moving to Fox Sports 1. Read on for our UFC 198 preview and predictions.
<h2>5. Warlley Alves vs. Bryan Barberena</h2>
Warlley Alves is a young, up-and-coming fighter in the welterweight division, and the hype surrounding him seems justified. Alves has fought four times for the UFC, finishing three of those fights by making his opponents tap to guillotine chokes. However, he is not a one-trick fighter; Alves can also handle himself well in the striking department.

Bryan Barberena’s claim to fame is that he put a stop to the Sage Northcutt hype train, submitting the younger fighter by arm triangle choke in January. But don’t expect Barberena to surprise the more experienced and well-rounded Alves in this fight.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction</span>: Alves by submission in the second round

<h2>4. Mauricio Rua vs. Corey Anderson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639654" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639654" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Gian-Villante-and-Corey-Anderson_UFC-640x427.jpg" alt="UFC 198 Preview and Predictions" width="757" height="505" /> Corey Anderson (R) fights Gian Villante in a light heavyweight bout during a UFC Fight Night event in 2015. | Alex Trautwig/Getty Images[/caption]

Corey Anderson may be the most talented light heavyweight on the UFC roster. He has a solid wrestling base and his striking improved in each of his six UFC fights. Anderson may not be the most skilled fighter in the division, but he works hard in the gym. In his last three fights, Anderson matched up against veteran fighters whose best days are behind them. UFC 198 is no different as Anderson faces former UFC light heavyweight champion Mauricio Rua.

Rua is a tough fighter with a good striking game, but he’s proven that he is hittable as of late. Rua won’t go down, but he will get touched up. Anderson will need to work the distance in this one, staying away from Rua’s kickboxing game if he wants to find success. This fight could put Anderson in the rankings with a win.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction</span>: Anderson by unanimous decision

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Cristiane Justino vs. Leslie Smith</h2>
[caption id="attachment_592854" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-592854" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cris-Cyborg-and-Gina-Carano-UFC.jpg" alt="UFC 198 Preview and Predictions" width="757" height="512" /> Cris Cyborg (R) battles Gina Carano during their Middleweight Championship fight in 2009. | Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images[/caption]

For Justino, the hardest part of this fight may be making the 140-pound catchweight limit. The Invicta FC featherweight champion has never fought as low as 140 pounds. She has, however, defeated 13 of her 17 professional opponents by knockout, including the last five women she faced.

Justino is, without hyperbole, the most feared striker to ever fight in women’s mixed martial arts. The word on the street is that Smith took this fight when no one else would. It’s hard to decide whether or not this promoter hyperbole is true, but it does make for a believable story.

If Cyborg can make the weight, this fight will be quick and violent, and hopefully one day set her up to face former UFC women’s bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey, a fighter who Justino says has been dodging her for a long while.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction</span>: Justino by knockout in the first round

<h2>2. Ronaldo Souza vs. Vitor Belfort</h2>
[caption id="attachment_592854" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-592854" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ronaldo-Jacare-Souza-UFC.jpg" alt="UFC 198 Preview and Predictions" width="757" height="512" /> Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza of Brazil celebrates a win during a UFC Fight Night event in 2015. | Alex Trautwig/Getty Images[/caption]

Belfort has always relied on his speed and power to end his opponent’s night. He enters the fight looking for an opening in the first round and when he finds that opening, he swarms, bombarding his opponent with strikes. The downside of that strategy is that if Belfort fails to get the knockout in the first round, he’s quick to fade, opening himself up to be finished in later rounds.

Souza is considered the best submission fighter in the UFC’s middleweight division, but he is more than that; he's also a fighter who can end his opponent’s night with his hands. The expectation is that Souza will be able to keep his distance from Belfort during the early part of the fight and take advantage of Belfort when his cardio falters.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction</span>: Souza by submission in the third round

<h2>1. Fabricio Werdum vs. Stipe Miocic</h2>
[caption id="attachment_592854" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-592854" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stipe-Miocic-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x433.jpg" alt="UFC 198 Preview and Predictions" width="757" height="512" /> Stipe Miocic during a UFC Fight Night event | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

There is one place that Miocic does not want to compete with Werdum -- on the ground. Werdum is one of the best jiu-jitsu players in the sport today, and if Miocic, a solid wrestler, does tangle with Werdum on the ground, it will not go well for the challenger. In this fight, Miocic’s best chance is to keep the contest standing and at distance. A clinch with Werdum will favor the champion, too.

The more we think about this fight, the more it’s hard to see Werdum losing. He may not get the submission win, but he’ll get the win in the end, and in doing so, the talk about Werdum being the best heavyweight the UFC has ever seen will begin to dominate the conversation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction</span>: Werdum by unanimous decision

		<description><![CDATA[With the first-round matchups of the 2016 playoffs officially set, here's a look at the 3 teams with the best odds to win this year's Stanley Cup.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_939743" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jonathan-Quick-Bruce-Bennett-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-939743" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jonathan-Quick-Bruce-Bennett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jonathan Quick celebrates with the Stanley Cup" width="757" height="505" /></a> Bruce Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

In the world of pro sports, success in the regular season is important. But the truth is, if you're looking for immortality, then the playoffs is when you must really shine. Throughout NHL history, plenty of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-performances-in-nhl-playoff-history.html/" target="_blank">players have come up big in the postseason</a>. And now that we're on the precipice of the 2016 playoffs, it's time to see if other individuals have what it takes to add their names to the list.

The quest for the Stanley Cup is no joke. Only the strong will survive. And now that we known which clubs have made it to the knockout stages, earning themselves a chance at glory, we can truly separate the contenders from the pretenders. While we have our own opinions on which teams will make the biggest splash, those crazy oddsmakers in Vegas tend to see things a bit differently. So if you want to see which three teams —entering the first round of the this year's playoffs — have the best chances to win the 2016 Stanley Cup, you’ve come to the right place. Although, full disclosure, we can’t promise you’ll like what you see.
<h2>3. Pittsburgh Penguins</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 15-2

The Pittsburgh Penguins enter the playoffs as the the No. 2 seed in the Metropolitan division, finishing the regular season with a record of <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2016.html" target="_blank">48-26-8 (104 points)</a>. While this group will face a tough matchup against the New York Rangers in the first round, by going <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/standings" target="_blank">8-2 in its last 10 games</a>, Pittsburgh enters the postseason as one of the hottest teams in the NHL. Plus, when you have the luxury of a player like Sidney Crosby -- 36 goals, 49 assists, 85 points (third in the league) -- leading the way, it's not hard to like your chances.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Chicago Blackhawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_939747" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jonathan-Toews-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-939747" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jonathan-Toews-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jonathan Toews #19 of the Chicago Blackhawks celebrates his second period goal with teammate Andrew Shaw #65" width="757" height="557" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 13-2

The champs are officially ready to defend their crown. Not only do the Chicago Blackhawks enter their first-round matchup against the St. Louis Blues as the <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2016.html" target="_blank">No. 3 seed in the Central division</a> (47-26-9, 103 points), but after finishing the regular season with 46 goals, 60 assists, and a career-best 106 points, superstar forward Patrick Kane heads into the postseason as the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/15181014/patrick-kane-chicago-blackhawks-first-american-lead-nhl-scoring" target="_blank">first American in history to lead the NHL in scoring</a>. If Kane can carry this momentum into the playoffs, and the rest of the Blackhawks can feed off his energy, then there's no reason why Chicago can't go back-to-back.

<h2>1. Washington Capitals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696691" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696691" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107844111-e1410381286706.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="542" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds</span>: 7-2

Despite consistently succeeding in regular season, the Washington Capitals are best known for falling apart under the bright lights of the playoffs. Perhaps this is the year they finally get over the hump. Alex Ovechkin <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/o/ovechal01.html" target="_blank">is a goal-scoring machine</a> who finished the year with a league-leading 50, netminder Braden Holtby <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/statistics" target="_blank">topped the NHL in wins</a> with 48, and the Capitals finished the regular season with the best record in the NHL at <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2016.html" target="_blank">56-18-8 (120 points)</a>. With the 2015-16 regular season in the books and the postseason set to get underway, Vegas believes Washington stands the best chance to lift Lord Stanley’s Cup. We'll find out soon enough if that prediction holds up.

		<description><![CDATA[With spring comes warm weather, and the 80th Masters Tournament in Augusta , Georgia. Who has the best chance to claim the green jacket this year?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_618056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618056" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Masters_David-Cannon_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="David Cannon/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> David Cannon/Getty Images[/caption]

The Masters tournament at Augusta National Golf Club is one of the most popular sporting events of the year. Invitation-only, the golf tournament is always the first major of the PGA Tour season, and is played at one of the most iconic venues in all of professional sports: Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. The annual tournament is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-traditions-of-the-masters.html/" target="_blank">full of history and tradition</a>, and the illustrious green jacket that the winner receives may be the most prestigious individual honor a professional golfer can get.

So, who are the favorites to come away with the green jacket this year? Here’s a look at the seven golfers with the best odds of winning the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2016-masters/" target="_blank">2016 Masters</a> according to the oddsmakers and sportsbooks in Las Vegas, Nevada.
<h2>7.  Phil Mickelson – 20/1</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618060" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618060" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Phil-Mickelson_Harry-How_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Harry How/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Mickelson is one of golf’s all-time greats, and anytime “Lefty” is in the field at Augusta National, he has to be considered a legitimate contender. He will be attempting to win his fourth career green jacket this year, and based on his strong play so far this season (five top-25 and three top-10 finishes), we like his chances.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6.  Rickie Fowler - 16/1</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618887" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rickie-Fowler_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Maddie Meyer/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Fowler is one of the best young golfers in the world, and despite all of the success the 2010 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/pga-tour/" target="_blank">PGA Tour</a> Rookie of the Year has enjoyed during his professional career, he is still out to capture his first major championship title. Fowler has had his sights set on winning the 2016 green jacket for some time now - he even had his equipment provider, Cobra, <a href="http://www.golfdigest.com/story/fowlers-frankenstein-club-for-the-masters" target="_blank">design him a new club</a> specifically with the par-5 15<sup>th</sup> hole at Augusta National in mind – and with the way he has played over the last two months, we like his chances.
<h2>5.  Adam Scott - 11/1</h2>
Scott is currently sitting at No. 6 in the Official World Golf Rankings, and is currently in 1<sup>st</sup>-place in the 2016 FedEx Cup standings. The 35-year-old Australian already has a green jacket on his resume (he won it in 2013), and with the way he has been playing in 2016 – he already has two wins and four top-10 finishes – Scott has to be considered one of the front-runners at this year’s Masters.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4.  Bubba Watson – 10/1</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618067" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618067" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bubba-Watson_Harry-How_Getty-Images-640x469.jpg" alt="Harry How/Getty Images" width="757" height="554" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

With wins in 2012 and 2014, Watson is no stranger to success at Augusta National. And he is absolutely one of the favorites to take home the green jacket in 2016. He is currently the No. 4 ranked golfer in the world, and with four top-25 and three top-10 finishes – which included wins at the Hero World Challenge and the Northern Trust Open – it is clear that Watson is currently playing near the top of his game. That said, even if he does indeed end up winning the Masters in 2016, he will have a hard time hitting a shot that would top his recovery out of the trees, which is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-shots-in-masters-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">arguably the greatest shot in Masters history</a>, to set up his 2012 win.
<h2>2. (tie)  Rory McIlroy - 7.5/1</h2>
Anytime McIlroy is in the field at Augusta National he has to be considered one of the favorites to come away with the green jacket. His game and style of play match up well with the course, and let’s not forget, the 26-year-old Northern Ireland native thrives on the game’s biggest stages. If McIlroy can come away with a Masters win in 2016, he will become the seventh player in golf history to complete the career grand slam.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. (tie)  Jordan Spieth – 7.5/1</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jordan-Spieth_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-618073" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jordan-Spieth_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Spieth’s win at Augusta in 2015 set up the Texas native for one of the greatest seasons by an individual golfer in recent memory. While he hasn’t been playing particularly well (by his standards) as of late, we still like his chances to defend his title at Augusta National in 2016, especially now that he has a Texas-sized chip on his shoulder after <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3510955/Jordan-Spieth-Losing-world-number-one-rank-blessing-ahead-Masters.html" target="_blank">losing his spot at the No. 1 player</a> in the world to Jason Day.
<h2>1.  Jason Day - 6.5/1</h2>
Day recently leapfrogged Spieth for the No. 1 spot in the World Golf Rankings, and based on his play as of late, it should come as no surprise that the 28-year-old Australian is the favorite to win the green jacket in 2016. Day has won each of his last two events – the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the World Golf Championships-Dell Match Play – and in total, he has two wins, three top-10’s and five top-25 finishes this season. All said, don’t be surprised if Day comes away with the second major championship title of his career at the 2016 Masters.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The world may still be watching the dust settle on <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nba-trade-deadline-5-teams-that-need-to-make-a-move-now.html/" target="_blank">the NBA trade deadline</a>, but that's only one sport, and that's only for players. What about coaches? Sure, it doesn't happen often (and some leagues have languages that forbid it, just ask Doc Rivers) but there are certainly teams that have found buyers for members of their coaching staffs before. We’re looking at the five best coaches across all sports that’ve gone on the block and been shipped out, regardless of which side instigated the departure.
<h2>5. Bill Parcells, New England to New York<strong>
</strong></h2>
&nbsp;

<h2></h2>
If there was ever a coach that was ready to move on and start anew, it was the NFL’s Bill Parcells. Now nearly synonymous with his insistence on leaving successful teams for floundering ones, Parcells found himself in a tenuous situation with the New England Patriots — specifically, he didn’t want to coach the team, but he was still under contract for another season. The solution?

“[Parcells] and Belichick would move to the New York Jets. Belichick would be head coach and Parcells would merely be his ‘adviser,’ his Bobby Heenan — thus technically not in violation of his existing deal,” Bryan Curtis wrote <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/10/15/bill-parcells-excerpt-bill-belichick-new-york-jets" target="_blank">for a Grantland piece covering the coach’s career</a>. “The next year, Parcells could become the Jets coach. The NFL office, for the second time, stopped him from implementing his plan. The Patriots wound up getting first-, second-, third-, and fourth-round picks for Parcells.”

<h2><strong>4. Stan Van Gundy, Miami to Orlando</strong></h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-730927 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SVG-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

The Miami Heat love to trade for coaches. In 1995, Pat Riley left the New York Knicks for South Beach, a move which wasn’t quite a trade (but was certainly contentious) at first, but it became a trade in absentia when Miami was forced to send the Knicks their 1996 first round pick and $1 million in cash. Years later, Stan Van Gundy would be “released” from his contract with the Heat a year early <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2895929" target="_blank">in exchange for a second round pick and an option to swap first rounders</a>.
<h2>3. Jon Gruden, Oakland to Tampa Bay</h2>
Arguably one of the most famous trades in NFL history, the Oakland Raiders sent Jon Gruden to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for “four draft picks — two first-rounders and two second-rounders — and $8 million,” because they were “faced with the reality that they were going to lose him one way or the other,” <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2002/feb/19/sports/sp-gruden19" target="_blank">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. At the outset, it seemed like a fair deal for both sides, but it clearly came back to bite Oakland when the Bucs thoroughly trounced the Raiders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVII" target="_blank">in the 2002 Super Bowl</a>.

<h2>2. Doc Rivers, Boston to Los Angeles</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-730937 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Doc-Rivers-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="451" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The most recent example of a head coach being traded for draft picks, Doc Rivers left the Boston Celtics in 2013 to join the Los Angeles Clippers. While the original exchange had<a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/06/25/celtics-announce-trade-of-doc-rivers-to-clippers/" target="_blank"> allegedly included</a> pieces like Kevin Garnett, DeAndre Jordan, and Eric Bledsoe, the NBA front office vetoed the trade as a rule in the league’s CBA prohibited players being traded for coaches. All in all, Rivers was swapped for a 2015 first rounder, and ascended to the Senior VP of Basketball Operations — effectively making him the franchise’s general manager, as well as its coach.
<h2>1. Bill Belichick, New York to New England</h2>
Chalk this one up to being another one of those “trades by reparations,” when Bill Belichick left the New York Jets <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-01/05/026r-010500-idx.html" target="_blank">after just one day of employment</a> in 2000 to sign with the New England Patriots, the New York squad decided to call BS on BB, who was still under contract with the team. After all the dust settled, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/28/sports/pro-football-patriots-hire-belichick-and-everyone-s-happy.html?src=pm" target="_blank">the Jets walked away</a> with New England’s first, fourth, and seventh round picks, while sending out a pair of their own picks (in the fifth and seventh round).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_709233" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709233 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Winnipeg-Jets-Derek-Leung-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Derek Leung/Getty Images[/caption]

Measuring the objective awfulness of an NHL team is a difficult thing. Because of the steady league expansion and the legacies that the Original Six — for those of you playing along at home, that would be the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and New York Rangers — laid down well before the inclusion of more than half of the league as it stands today, measuring things like winning percentage, total number of losses, and the like don’t capture the full depth of what makes one team better than another, or, more specifically, why some teams just aren’t as good as their peers.

So, some baseline criteria. Using data from <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com" target="_blank">Hockey Reference</a>, we took a look at the teams in the NHL that have losing records over the lifetime of the franchise. That’s step one and an essential element in determining whether teams are in contention for the worst team ever. Then, we compared their points percentage — essentially, how many times they scored compared to how many times they could have scored — and their overall playoff success. If you’re making it to the postseason or even winning the Stanley Cup, that’s got to factor into the equation.

In other words, science, numbers, and some subjectivity have all been considered. Here, then, are the five worst NHL teams of all time.

<h2>5. Carolina Hurricanes</h2>
Formerly the New England Whalers and then the Hartford Whalers before undergoing a geographic shift as well as an identity makeover, the Carolina Hurricanes, an NHL team under one moniker or another since 1979, when the WHA merged with the league, have not been very good. While the ‘Canes do have one Stanley Cup to their credit and 13 playoff appearances with varying degrees of success to their name, their lackluster point percentage (0.475) and their overall record of 1,334-1,271 with 263 ties hurts them, too.

<h2>4. Tampa Bay Lightning</h2>
Consider the fact that the Tampa Bay Lightning, who came into the league nearly two decades after the Carolina Hurricanes, have already scored more than half of the points of the older franchise. So why rank the team so low? Not only are the Lightning the second-worst team in the league when it comes to point percentages, their playoff successes, and even appearances, are scant — although they’re saved (a bit) by a Stanley Cup victory.

<h2>3. Florida Panthers</h2>
The closest club on this list to go an even .500, the Florida Panthers are generally regarded as an also-ran squad, given the team’s pathological inability to make it into the playoffs. Since joining the NHL in 1993, the Panthers have just four postseason runs to their credit and just a single year at the top of their division. That is not the stuff that dreams are made of — that’s the stuff of nightmares. Their record, by the way, is 655 wins to 706 losses.

<h2>2. Winnipeg Jets</h2>
Helping to confirm a pet theory that all sports teams with the nickname “Jets” are destined for a lifetime of decrepitude and decay, the second-youngest team on our list — coincidentally, the newer franchise holds the No. 1 spot — has been nothing short of not good for what feels like its entire existence, making the playoffs just once, in 2007, when the Jets were still known as the Atlanta Thrashers.

<h2>1. Columbus Blue Jackets</h2>
Youch. The Columbus Blue Jackets, welcomed into the NHL at the turn of the century, are the worst team in the league (in our estimation). Managing to barely scrape 450 wins in 15 years as a franchise, the Blue Jackets have the lowest points percentage in the entire NHL at .467. While the Blue Jackets are a young franchise and can look forward to the hope of better years ahead, they’re still a team that’s only finished better than fourth in their division once. Ever.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_685583" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685583 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Yankees-Logo-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="491" /> Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

What’s the point of compiling any kind of record about sports if you can’t use it to compare it to other teams in an effort to establish definitive metrics of greatness? While the purest joy in sports is also the simplest — watching people who are doing things that the vast majority of the human population cannot, and doing them in a way that makes the viewer stop what they’re doing and marvel in how cool it all is — the enduring myth of sports is that winning is everything. Winning is important. The game, whatever it is, must be won, and the better athletes, coaches, and teams come out on top, as winners.

In that spirit, here are the seven teams in American History that stand as the winningest teams of all time, pitted against each other to see which one has the greatest winning percentage of all time — because different sports have different seasons, and some teams have had more opportunities to add on W’s than others.

<h2>7 (tie). Dallas Cowboys, 55.4 Winning Percentage (510 Wins)</h2>
Christened America’s Team in the aftermath of their marvelous 1978 campaign, the Dallas Cowboys are the youngest NFL franchise on this list — having been brought into existence in 1960 as an NFL expansion team, the ‘Boys are one of two teams to hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances, making it all the way to the big game on eight separate occasions. The other team? The Pittsburgh Steelers.

<h2>7 (tie). Chicago Bears, 55.4 Winning Percentage ( 747 Wins)</h2>
Standing tall as the most successful team in the NFL, the Chicago Bears — who were instrumental in sowing the seeds for modern day football — have a storied rivalry with fellow elder statesmen Green Bay. All in all, the two teams have faced each other nearly 190 times, and Chicago has come out on top, historically, notching 98 wins to the Packers’ 88. The teams have tied six times.

<h2>5. New York Yankees, 56.8 Winning Percentage (9,986 Wins)</h2>
For a club so synonymous with winning, the Yankees might be a surprise rounding into fifth place on this list, but the team has more wins stacked up than any other team on this list combined. A byproduct of being around since the dawn of time, the Bronx Bombers have also picked up more losses than any other team on this list, racking up 7,606 losses. On the bright side, the Yankees would have to suffer several successive seasons of bad baseball in order to dip down to .500, so you’ll probably never see them be an average baseball team.

<h2>4. Green Bay Packers, 57.6 Winning Percentage (741 Wins)</h2>
The Packers, founded in 1919, can trace their lineage directly back to the time before the NFL was a billion dollar industry, when regionally affiliated teams would play against each other without any idea that their sport would transform into the megalith that it is today. The Packers have never forgotten their roots, evidenced by their status as a community-owned franchise, even if the stocks that the team periodically makes available are largely symbolic. They’re also one of the most successful squads in the league, stockpiling 741 wins against 561 losses.

<h2>3. Boston Celtics, 58.8 Winning Percentage (3,167 Wins)</h2>
The first basketball team on this list (but not the last), the Boston Celtics’ faithful will maintain that they are first in the only category that matters: Championships. And, when you’re about to put such a questionable roster on the floor for the upcoming NBA season, maybe that’s the only thing you can look for — the comfort of past achievements. As the superior half of one of the world’s most famous sports rivalries, the Celtics can take solace in the fact that their future is looking brighter than the Los Angeles Lakers.

<h2>2. San Antonio Spurs, 59.5 Winning Percentage (2,311 Wins)</h2>
One of the only teams to survive the NBA-ABA merger of 1976, alongside the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers, and the Brooklyn Nets, the San Antonio Spurs have amassed a ton of victories in their thirty-eight years as an NBA team, only dipping into a losing record a handful of times in the franchise’s history. The last time, they won the draft lottery and grabbed Tim Duncan, one of the all-time greats, in 1997. They haven’t lost fewer than 50 games in any normal season since.

<h2>1. Los Angeles Lakers, 60.4 Winning Percentage (3,217 Wins)</h2>
A successful team even before they wound up in Hollywood, the Los Angeles Lakers, with their lifetime record totaling in at over 61 percent for the win column, are America’s most successful team in the major American sports. In case you’re wondering about the absence of the NHL, the most successful hockey team, the Dallas Stars, sit at a 51.9 percent, right behind the Chicago Bulls in twenty-seventh place.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_811698" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiger-Woods-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-e1433966567648.jpg"><img class="wp-image-811698 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiger-Woods-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-e1433966567648.jpg" alt="Tiger Woods shoots at The Memorial" width="757" height="531" /></a> Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

You are well aware that pro athletes make a ridiculous amount of money, but did you know that the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/10/with-300-million-haul-floyd-mayweather-tops-forbes-2015-list-of-the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes/" target="_blank">100 highest-paid athletes made $3.2 billion</a> in total over the last 12 months? We didn’t either. And we’ve never wanted to be professional athletes more.

But that is exactly what <a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> does. It crunches the numbers, organizes the information, and makes you realize that some folks simply have it better than you — financially speaking, of course. This time around, Forbes compiled its list of the world’s highest paid athletes, and the we have a feeling you’ll recognize most of the names. Yet, we’re sure you’re dying to know where their bank comes from. Leave it to Forbes to fill in the blank there too:

“Our earnings figures include all salaries, prize money and bonuses paid out between June 1, 2014, and June 1, 2015. Endorsement incomes are an estimate of sponsorship deals, appearance fees and licensing fees for the 12 months through June 1 based on conversations with dozens of industry insiders. We do not deduct for taxes or agents’ fees and we do not include investment income."

Now that the groundwork has been laid out, the only thing left to do is get on with the list itself. With that in mind, here are the seven highest-paid athletes in 2015.

<h2>7. Kevin Durant</h2>

</ul>
Despite a disappointing 2014-15 season, that saw him only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/kevin-durant/?list=athletes" target="_blank">play in only 27 games</a> due to a foot injury, Kevin Durant’s bank account never felt the brunt of the punishment. KD earned <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder/kevin-durant/" target="_blank">roughly $19 million</a> from the Oklahoma City Thunder this past year, but we all know it’s his endorsement money that makes the biggest splash. He signed a monster <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11443079/kevin-durant-oklahoma-city-thunder-stays-nike-shoe-company-matches-armour-offer" target="_blank">10-year, $300 million deal with Nike</a> back in 2014, and this arrangement will also pay him royalties. Along with that partnership, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/kevin-durant/?list=athletes" target="_blank">Forbes notes</a> that Durant has sponsorship deals with companies such as BBVA, Sprint, Sonic, Panini, 2K Sports, Skullcandy. It’s no wonder that KD’s total earnings in 2015 hit $54.1 million.

<a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/lebron_james/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a> may not be No.1 on this list, but his $64.8 million haul in 2015 still makes him the King of the National Basketball Association. James made $20.8 million from his salary with the Cleveland Cavaliers — and he’s earned every last penny. In just his first season back with his original team, the King has taken this inexperienced bunch all the way to the NBA Finals. The task at hand isn’t over, but he’s still been <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-impressive-is-lebron-james-nba-finals-streak.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">making history</a> along the way. Off the court, he took home $44 million in endorsements. James is affiliated with companies such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/lebron-james/?list=athletes" target="_blank">Nike, Kia, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Beats by Dre</a>. The list could go on, but we’re sure you get the gist of it. Suffice to say, it pays to be the King.

<a href="http://www.biography.com/people/roger-federer-13612203" target="_blank">Roger Federer</a> is <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Rankings-Home.aspx" target="_blank">currently the No. 2 ranked</a> tennis player in the world. Yet, he is unquestionably, the highest-paid player on the tour. He may not be winning as much on the court ($9 million last year) as he used to — being 33 years old will do that do a pro — but he doesn’t need a racket to keep raking it in. The winner of 17 career Grand Slams is making a killing in endorsement money. His <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/roger-federer/?list=athletes" target="_blank">portfolio includes</a> deals with Nike, Rolex, Credit Suisse, and Mercedes-Benz. With friends like this paying him $58 million combined last year, Federer was able to reach $67 million in total earnings last year. Game. Set. Match.

Barcelona’s magician <a href="http://www.espnfc.us/player/45843/lionel-messi" target="_blank">Lionel Messi</a> used his quick feet to bring in a total of $73.8 million last year. He’s so vital to the club’s success that they pretty much throw the bank at him. Messi was paid $51.8 million last year to simply make others look foolish on the pitch. He makes it seem so easy when you watch him play the beautiful game. But its not. He’s just that good. Of course, if you’re the kind of guy who puts up 43 goals in league play alone — like he did in 2014-15 — big companies are always going to want your face <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/lionel-messi/?list=athletes" target="_blank">associated with their brands</a>. Which is while Adidas and Samsung are part of the Lionel Messi fan club. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33084879" target="_blank">What he does with the money, of course, is anybody’s guess</a>.

Not to be outdone by the only player on the planet who rivals him, Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo came away as the highest-paid soccer player last year, with a cool $79.6 million in total earnings. He punishes opponents on the field and scores goals at a ridiculous rate. As a result, his club had no issue with paying him $52.6 million this past season. But when you’re the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/lionel-messi/?list=athletes" target="_blank">most popular athlete</a> in the world –102 million Facebook and <a href="https://twitter.com/cristiano" target="_blank">36.1 million Twitter followers</a> — and conventionally handsome, the endorsement deals will always be available.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/manny-pacquiao/?list=athletes" target="_blank">According to Forbes</a>, Manny Pacquiao made a solid $12 million last year from his endorsement deals with Nike, Foot Locker, Wonderful Pistachios, Nestle’s Butterfinger, and others in the Philippines.

But let’s get serious, it’s the $125 million payday from his <a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/12463639/floyd-mayweather-jr-manny-pacquiao-hype-2-megafight" target="_blank">megafight</a> against Floyd Mayweather Jr. on May 2, that made Pacman extra rich this past year. Sure, he fought with a bum shoulder. Sure, there could be ramifications from not disclosing this injury. Sure, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/did-manny-pacquiao-mislead-the-public.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">misled the public</a>.

<a href="http://www.fightsaga.com/Fighters/item/56-Floyd-Mayweather-Jr-Record-Bio-Profile-Facts-Stats" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather Jr</a>. may not be the most popular guy out there, but he is 2015’s highest-paid athlete. Did you see the $100 million check he received right after his bout with Pacquiao? Yeah, that was real. But as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/10/with-300-million-haul-floyd-mayweather-tops-forbes-2015-list-of-the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes/" target="_blank">Forbes notes</a>, he’ll really cash out when all the revenue figures are totaled.

Some people are so money and they don’t even know it. Floyd Mayweather Jr. is most certainly not one of them.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone loves a good celebrity scandal, but almost as popular are the controversies surrounding professional athletes. Fans often project certain images onto their favorite players as wholesome, hard-working images of hero athletes enjoying the culmination of a lifetime of hard work when they reach the pros. That may be true for some, but athletes are far from superhuman, and they are prone to give in to excess and temptation just as much — if not more so — than everybody else. From sex scandals to drugs to simple poor sportsmanship, following are 10 of the most controversial professional athletes of all time. Because of the nature of this list, these athletes are not ranked in a specific order.
<h2><strong>1. Lance Armstrong</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_496527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Lance-Armstrong-Handout-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496527 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lance-Armstrong-Handout-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Handout/Getty Images[/caption]

It's hard to say if anyone on this list has a more gut-wrenching story than Lance Armstrong. The seven-time Tour de France winner impressed many with his cycling prowess and inspired even more with his personal story of overcoming testicular cancer, becoming an activist in the fight to find a cure for the disease. There was a time when it seemed everyone was wearing the yellow Livestrong bracelets, which were a hallmark of Armstrong’s foundation and a crusade against the disease. He was, as <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/22/sport/lance-armstrong-profile-cycling-usada/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> described him, “an all-American hero.”

But then came the doping scandal. The public was disappointed and outraged by Armstrong’s admission that he had used steroids — something he swore he’d never done time and time again — and he was banned from the sport by the International Cycling Union, stripped of his Tour de France titles, forced to step down from the head of the Livestrong foundation, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/23/lance-armstrong-endorsement-earnings_n_2005720.html" target="_blank">lost countless endorsements</a>.

<h2>2. Michael Vick</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496535" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Michael-Vick-Alex-Trautwig-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496535 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Michael-Vick-Alex-Trautwig-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="538" /></a> Alex Trautwig/Getty Images[/caption]

The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback engaged in perhaps some of the more despicable behavior on this list. Worse than John McEnroe’s expletives, Tiger Woods’s sex addiction, or Armstrong’s doping, Michael Vick was embroiled in a dogfighting scandal that led to him being <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3148549" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to 23 months in prison.

A <a href="http://assets.espn.go.com/media/pdf/070717/vick_indictment.pdf" target="_blank">19-page indictment</a> said that "He attended fights and paid off bets when his dogs lost." It said he also was involved in the executions of dogs that did not perform well. After serving his term with 21 months in prison and two under house arrest, Vick was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles, the New York Jets, and is currently a free agent.

<h2>3. Mike Tyson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496536" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Mike-Tyson-Ethan-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496536 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mike-Tyson-Ethan-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="518" /></a> Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Famous boxer Mike Tyson has become more notorious for his misdeeds than for his athletic achievements. In 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and spent three years in jail, though <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/sports/tyson-gets-6-year-prison-term-for-rape-conviction-in-indiana.html" target="_blank">he was originally sentenced to 10</a>. In 1997, Tyson made headlines after a boxing match with Evander Holyfield, during which he bit off a 1-inch piece of his opponent’s ear. You probably saw his cameo in <em>The Hangover</em>.

<h2>4. Dennis Rodman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496537" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Dennis-Rodman-Andrew-H.-Walker-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496537 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Dennis-Rodman-Andrew-H.-Walker-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="530" /></a> Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images[/caption]

The former Chicago Bulls player most recently stirred up controversy by making two trips to North Korea, during which he was photographed acting chummy with Kim Jong-Un. Many criticized Rodman’s friendship with the leader, as North Korea is notoriously corrupt and oppressive, not to mention the fact that Kim recently announced the execution of his own uncle. But Rodman was making waves long before he set foot on North Korean soil.

During his years with the Bulls, Rodman’s antics — such as dying his hair outlandish colors and wearing a wedding dress in public — often drew more attention than his actual skills, which formed an integral part of the second Chicago Bulls three-peat. <a href="http://www.askmen.com/sports/business/sportbusiness7.html" target="_blank">Ask Men</a> described him as a "showbiz athlete" and said that as a player, Rodman "was himself, but didn’t sabotage his chances for success."

<h2>5. Barry Bonds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496538" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Barry-Bonds-Jason-O.-Watson-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496538 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Barry-Bonds-Jason-O.-Watson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="519" /></a> Jason O. Watson/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/03/28/110328fa_fact_mcgrath" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a> has described Barry Bonds as “the greatest baseball player who ever lived," but that title has been tainted by Bonds’s high-profile steroid scandal, souring his image as a stellar ballplayer and casting a shadow over his impressive achievements. The magazine also described Bonds as defensive and somewhat belligerent, unapologetic for his perceived misdeeds. In addition to the doping allegations, Bonds stood trial for perjury, accused of lying under oath about his steroid use. He was ultimately convicted of obstruction of justice. Despite his claims of innocence, the scandal sullied Bonds’s career, and he has yet to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

<h2>6. Mark McGwire</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496539" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Mark-McGwire-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496539 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mark-McGwire-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

He held the nation enraptured in 1998 as millions watched the baseball player become victorious in his quest to break the home run record. Mark McGwire became a kind of national hero, until he, too, became embroiled in a steroid scandal. McGwire admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs, including human growth hormones. He claimed that the supplements were for "<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4816607" target="_blank">health purposes</a>" only. McGwire himself admitted that going public about his steroid use would cast doubt on his abilities. Both McGwire and Bonds were among a number of high-profile baseball players who either admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs or were accused of doing so. Others involved in the scandal include Andy Petitte, Alex Rodriguez, and Roger Clemens.

<h2>7. Tiger Woods</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496540" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Tiger-Woods-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496540 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tiger-Woods-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /></a> Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

Golf legend Tiger Woods served as an inspirational figure for many until his wholesome image came crumbling down during a painfully public sex scandal that destroyed his marriage and image. In 2009, after a bizarre car crash outside his home, allegations came pouring out about Woods’ extramarital transgressions, and he eventually admitted to cheating on then-wife Elin Nordegren. A number of women came forward claiming to have had an affair with Woods, including porn star Devon James, who <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/tiger-woods-mistress-15-devon-james-more-women-are-coming-forward-claims/" target="_blank">claimed to have had a threesome</a> with the golf pro and another woman. This scandal got so much coverage that there was even an entire <em>South Park</em> episode dedicated to the attention everyone was paying to Woods's personal life.

<h2>8. John McEnroe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496547" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/John-McEnroe-Joe-Scarnici-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496547 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/John-McEnroe-Joe-Scarnici-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Joe Scarnici/Getty Images[/caption]

No one disputes John McEnroe’s prowess at tennis. His personality? Well, it's not quite as beyond reproach. McEnroe is almost as famous for his surly attitude toward opponents and referees as he is for his tennis skills. Notorious for insulting his opponents’ playing and becoming enraged on the court, McEnroe maintains the dubious honor of having been defaulted from games on more than one occasion for using foul language. For a time, his poor sportsmanship is so blatant that <a href="http://www.thetennisspace.com/top-10-worst-moments-for-john-mcenroe/" target="_blank">The Tennis Space</a> has an entire article detailing "The Top 10 Worst Moments for John McEnroe." That such a list exists largely speaks to the ubiquity of his acerbic nature.

<h2>9. LeBron James</h2>
[caption id="attachment_496548" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/LeBron-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-496548 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LeBron-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

LeBron James is arguably the most divisive player in the NBA right now, perhaps in history. No one disputes that LeBron’s got game, but many think he also has a big head, a criticism that has been thrown at him since he announced that he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010. In a television special titled "The Decision" — highly criticized for being narcissistic and a waste of time, despite being a charity fundraiser — James announced that he was "taking his talents to South Beach."

He was derided by critics and fans alike when his performance with the Miami Heat <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/lebron-james-hated-man-basketball/story?id=13832164" target="_blank">pretty much tanked</a>. Though James began playing well again, his high profile and presumed arrogance have made him an ongoing target for criticism of his attitude and his playing skills. It's worth noting, though, that James's return to Cleveland in summer 2014 did wonders for repairing his reputation among sports fans.

The handsome footballer -- soccer, for Americans -- seems to invite controversy wherever he goes. <a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Cristiano_Ronaldo_vs_Lionel_Messi" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo is an exceptional player</a>, which is why he gets away with some less-than-attractive behavior. Ronaldo plays for Real Madrid and is widely acknowledged as being among the best in the sport, but he can come across as bratty and attention-seeking by making <a href="http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/barcelona/id/135?cc=4716" target="_blank">vague, childish complaints</a> about being poorly treated by his team and perceived injustices. Off the field, he pulled a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-376502/Britney-condemned-driving-baby-lap.html" target="_blank">Britney Spears</a> in 2012 when he was spotted driving his <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2137270/Cristiano-Ronaldo-shocks-driving-son-lap--reunites-girlfriend-Irina-Shayk-rare-unity.html" target="_blank">Lamborghini</a> with his 22-month-old son sitting in his lap.

		<description><![CDATA[What makes a great fan? There may not be any way to tell for sure, but the measure of respect from other communities is one of the best.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_706297" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706297 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chicago-Scott-Olson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="497" /> Scott Olson/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to the truly great sports cities across the United States of America, there’s not a lot to separate out which ones are better than the others, objectively speaking. Beyond the fact that one’s hometown or adopted locale is, of course, unequivocally superior to the other team’s, it’s difficult to actively convey which is more important to an unbiased viewpoint. You could look for the number of teams, the successes of those squads, the metrics behind them (tickets sold and such), but more does not mean better unless you’re counting championships, and simply because one community is larger than another does not imply superiority.

Amidst the myriad ways to quantify fandom, then, is to look at votes. While popularity contests like the one that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/" target="_blank">USA Toda</a><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/" target="_blank">y</a><em> </em>put on, which asked readers to rank the best cities for sports, have their own problems, perception is a big part of what makes a sports city great. In other words, there’s a reason why you won’t see Atlanta here (a spoiler, we guess, but you probably knew that). So, without further explanation, here are the five best cities for athletic achievement, as determined by the votes of fans.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Green Bay, Wisconsin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706320" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706320 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Packers-Fan-Kena-Krutsinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Kena Krutsigner/Getty Images[/caption]

While Green Bay’s community ownership of the Packers might not actually mean very much as far as the daily operations of the franchise are concerned, no one can doubt the city’s sincerity and commitment to its football team, which is one of the oldest squads in NFL history, and is closing in on its centennial anniversary.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706333" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706333 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Pittsburgh-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

Oftentimes forgotten as the second city in Pennsylvania’s sports history, Yinzer fans can rejoice, insofar as they’ve totally crushed Philly on this poll — and, lest we forget, Pittsburgh actually has a couple of good sports teams that represent their city this year, which is another thing that can’t be claimed by their only statewide competition.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Chicago, Illinois</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696991" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696991 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chicago-Cubs-Jefferey-Phelps-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Jeffrey Phelps/Getty images[/caption]

The first city on this list that has a sports team in each of the major American sports (and an MLS team, the Chicago Fire for extra points), the Windy City is also the largest city on this list, and that’s before we get to the suburbs and ‘Greater’ region. Between the Bulls, the Blackhawks, the Bears, and the other, non B-word teams — both the MLB squads, the Cubs and the White Sox — Chicago’s got a lot to brag about, and a lot to encourage a strong sports community. When a Saturday Night Live skit mocking your fans becomes iconic, you’re clearly a sports town worth noticing.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Boston, Massachusetts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692459" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692459" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Boston-Skyline-Darren-McCollester-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="506" /> Darren McCollester/Getty Images[/caption]

While Boston’s fallen off a little bit from their Titletown heights that defined their sports in the 2000s, the fans’ reputation for fanatical behavior has remained strong even as the Red Sox and the Celtics have arguably lost a step or two or all of them, depending on which team you’re talking about. At least they’ve still got the Bruins -- oh, and their NFL team, the Patriots.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Detroit, Michigan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706348" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706348" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Detroit-Skyline-Spencer-Platt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Spencer Platt/Getty Images[/caption]

Not what you were expecting, was it? Detroit, most commonly cited as an example of an economic disaster, is still the best sports community in the country, as voted on by people who spend their time thinking about such things. Note: We’re pretty sure that this result wasn’t due to ballot stuffing, because this was an Internet poll, and if what we’ve read about Detroit the last few years is any indication, its population is living in the middle of a hellscape straight out of <em>Mad Max</em> (or, possibly, a Great Lakes Edition of <em>Waterworld</em>). Kevin Costner had a lot of cool stuff on his trimaran, but he didn’t have WiFi.

For the rest of the list, click <a href="http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-city-for-sports/" target="_blank">here</a>. There’s a bunch of other cool cities to be counted — including one more spot in Michigan, and no New York. Wild, right?

		<description><![CDATA[It's not often that professional athletes are able to outperform their parents, but it does happen on occasion. Here are 5 players who accomplished that feat.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_791858" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791858 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Manning-Family-e1429802642372.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Michael Loccisano/Getty Images[/caption]

Considering that today is officially National Take Your Child to Work day, we can’t help but think about the relationships between parents and children in the world of professional sports. It’s fair to say that a lot of pro athletes are blessed with great genetics, and that can be extremely beneficial.

Of course, no athlete is going to be successful unless that individual is willing to put in the hard work. But it’s impossible not to think that the kid of a pro athlete didn’t at least get a bit of a head start. On top of the traits passed down from one generation to the next, there’s also early exposure to this unique world; there’s no way this doesn’t help prepare someone looking to follow in his or her parent’s footsteps. That’s why this “holiday" must be a little bit cooler if someone’s parent plays at the highest level of any pro sport.

Still, this must come with some added pressure and plenty of potential disappointment. For a lot of people, it’s normal to look up to a parent. After all, parents are among your biggest role models. Now imagine what it must be like for the child of a world-class athlete. Not only do you often witness their greatness, but you strive to achieve a standard that may never be reached. That in itself can be disheartening. Then imagine for a second that the opposite occurs and a child is able to follow those footsteps and ultimately surpass a parent. That’d be pretty sweet.

It doesn’t happen often that the kid of a pro athlete is able to outshine a parent. Yet it does happen enough that it’s worth calling attention to it. So, in honor of the day when parents are able to take their children to work, we’re going to focus on some athletes who managed to take their parents to school. Here’s a look at five professional athletes who managed to upstage their parents.

<h2>1. Stephen Curry and Dell Curry</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791863" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791863 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stephen-and-Dell-Curry-e1429803248552.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

There’s no question who <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html" target="_blank">Stephen Curry</a> got his smooth stroke from. His father could shoot the rock with the best of them. In his 16-year career, Dell Curry hit 1,245 shots from long range, compiled a 40.2% three-point percentage, and was an 84.3% shooter from the free throw line.

The elder Curry was also named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year during the 1993-1994 season. He was a fine pro in the National Basketball Association. And yet, in his brief career, young Steph has already usurped the man who taught him the game.

The <a href="http://www.nba.com/warriors/playoffs/2015" target="_blank">Golden State Warriors</a> more than likely thank their lucky stars every night that six teams opted to pass over the stud point guard in the 2009 NBA Draft. What Steph has already accomplished in his six seasons in the league is simply unbelievable. He’s connected on 1,191 three-pointers and shoots 44% from deep.

He’s also averaging more than 20 points per game for his career and shoots 90% from the line. Steph has made the All-Star Game twice, is a gifted pickpocket on the defensive end, and can create his shot off the dribble unlike anyone the game’s ever seen. It’s only a matter of team before he adds an MVP award to his mantle. Oh, and he was the best player on the NBA's best team in 2015, and a major part of breaking the Golden State Warrior's title drought.

<h2>2. Ken Griffey Jr. and Ken Griffey Sr.</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791859" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791859 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Griffey-family-e1429802796206.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="496" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

There was nothing too shabby about Ken Griffey Sr.’s 19-year career in the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/home" target="_blank">big leagues</a>. He made three All-Star Games, had a career batting average of .296, and compiled a total of 2,143 hits. Griffey Sr. also won the World Series twice as a member of the Cincinnati Reds (1975 and 1976). Still, when you think about the baseball royalty that was the Griffey family, it’s hard not to immediately associate the name with Junior.

<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=115135#gameType='R'&amp;sectionType=career&amp;statType=1&amp;season=2015&amp;level='MLB'" target="_blank">Ken Griffey Jr.</a> was so gifted on the diamond that they nicknamed him “The Natural." Griffey Jr. started his 22-year Major League career in 1989, at the age of 19. Before he finally hung up his cleats, the Kid did some serious damage to opposing teams. On top of the 2,781 hits and 1,836 RBIs, Junior managed to also smash 630 home runs. He made 13 All-Star Game appearances, took home seven Silver Slugger Awards, and won the American League MVP in 1997. And for good measure, he was ridiculously talented in the field as well. That’s why he would wrap up 10 Gold Gloves as an outfielder.

Griffey Sr. was certainly good. But Griffey Jr. was special.

<h2>3. Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791864" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-791864 size-medium" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bonds-family-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> Otto Greule/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

Bobby Bonds had a solid career in the major leagues that spanned 14 seasons. In that time, he made three All-Star teams, took home three Gold Gloves, and recorded the 49th-most stolen bases of all time (461). But his time in the big leagues is nothing compared that of his son’s.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/1785/barry-bonds" target="_blank">Barry Bonds</a> may always have an <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3036756" target="_blank">asterisk next to his name</a>, but there’s no denying he was a phenomenal baseball player. Tainted career or not, Bonds still won seven NL Most Valuable Player Awards, two batting titles, eight Gold Gloves, and 12 Silver Slugger Awards. And while he also played in 14 All-Star Games, folks will always associate him with the long ball. In 2001, Bonds went yard 73 times (a single-season record) and has 762 total home runs to his name. They may not have all been clean shots, but they were still impressive to watch.

<h2>4. Peyton Manning and Archie Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791855" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791855 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Peyton-and-Archie-Manning-e1429802497995.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images[/caption]

Archie Manning played quarterback in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> for 13 seasons, and given how often he was sacked, the most impressive thing about his career is its longevity, although he did happen to make the Pro Bowl in both 1978 and 1979. If you’re looking for his best contribution to the sport of football, then look no further than his offspring, specifically his son Peyton.

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00.htm" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a> is one of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game. He may only have one Super Bowl under his belt (younger brother Eli has two), but that fact should do nothing to tarnish his outstanding legacy. His career numbers speak for themselves: 69,691 passing yards, 5,927 completed passes, 530 passing touchdowns, 14-time Pro Bowler, seven-time First-Team All-Pro, and winner of five NFL MVP awards. Is there really anything else left to say?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Kobe Bryant and Joe Bryant</h2>
[caption id="attachment_791861" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-791861 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kobe-and-Joe-Bryant-e1429803099962.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

While Joe Bryant found most of his success playing international basketball in Italy, he did play eight seasons in the NBA and was the 14th overall pick in the 1975 NBA Draft. During his time in the National Basketball Association, the elder Bryant never managed to eclipse 11.8 points per game in a single season, but he did have a fantastic nickname: Jellybean. None of this can compare to what his kid has accomplished.

<a href="http://kobebryant.com/" target="_blank">Kobe Bryant</a> is a star, a winner, and one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. In his 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association, Bryant is a 17-time All-Star, a two-time scoring champ, an 11-time First-Team All-NBA member, a one-time MVP, and a winner of five NBA championships. He is also third on the all-time NBA scoring list, with 32,482 points. He’s easily one of the most lethal competitors the sport has ever seen. Is it any wonder they call him the “Black Mamba?"

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a breakdown of the longest active playoff droughts in the MLB, NHL, NBA, and NFL.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_703788" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703788 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/455507910-e1411755076263.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="532" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

On September 26, 2014, the <a title="Royals End Drought" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/96183/royals-end-longest-active-playoff-drought" target="_blank">Kansas City Royals beat the Chicago White Sox and clinched a spot in the American League Playoffs</a>. The win ended their 29-year postseason drought, which was the longest active playoff drought in professional sports.

<a title="Longest MLB Droughts" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/royal-pains-over-4-longest-current-mlb-postseason-droughts.html/" target="_blank">Major League Baseball is home to a trio of teams with playoff droughts spanning a decade or more</a>. How does that compare to the other three major professional sports leagues (National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, and National Football League) in the United States? Here is a breakdown of the three longest active playoff droughts in each league.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Major League Baseball</h2>
<h2>1. Toronto Blue Jays</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703776" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-703776 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/485003189-e1411754237540.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="756" height="539" /> Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>1993

The Blue Jays actually finished with a winning record in 2014 (83-79), but play in a powerhouse division in the AL East. There is no doubting the talent on their roster, and standing at first place in their division, the Blue Jays may be able to finally make it back to the postseason.
<h2>2. Seattle Mariners</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2001

Seattle also finished with a winning record (87-75) in 2014 and their <a title="M's Sign Cano" href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/10125503/robinson-cano-seattle-mariners-finalize-huge-contract" target="_blank">signing of Robinson Cano</a> last offseason showed they are willing to spend big money and displayed a commitment to winning. Similar to the Blue Jays, the Mariners have to battle a team with one of the highest payrolls in baseball (LA Angels) and one of the best pitching staffs in baseball (Oakland A’s) within their division.
<h2>3. Miami Marlins</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2003

This is a drought that could last a long time. The Marlins have the <a title="Payrolls" href="http://deadspin.com/2014-payrolls-and-salaries-for-every-mlb-team-1551868969" target="_blank">second lowest payroll in the league</a> and an ownership group that isn’t truly committed to winning.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>National Hockey League</h2>
<h2>1. Edmonton Oilers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705732" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705732 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Edmonton-Oilers-640x463.jpg" alt="Source: Bruce Bennett/Getty Images" width="757" height="548" /> Bruce Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2005-06

Expectations are high in Edmonton for the 2015-2016 season. But for a team that is still in rebuilding mode, it would not be a surprise to see this drought extended for at least one more year.
<h2>2. &amp; 3. Calgary Flames and Carolina Hurricanes</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearances: </strong>2008-09

The Flames are in full-fledged rebuilding mode with very few people outside of their locker room giving them much of a chance to make a playoff run.

An uphill battle to rebuild got even tougher for the Hurricanes when they <a title="Staal Injury" href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/11578278/jordan-staal-carolina-hurricanes-hurts-right-leg-preseason-game" target="_blank">lost Jordan Staal to a broken leg</a>. This team was painfully bad in all phases of the game last season, so a trip to the playoffs next season is highly unlikely.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>National Basketball Association</h2>
<h2>1. Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
[caption id="attachment_495533" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-495533" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Minnesota-Timberwolves-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andrew Wiggins takes a moment to reflect" width="757" height="505" /> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2004

Now fully removed from the Kevin Love Era, the T-Wolves are now a group of young, potential-filled players led by Andrew Wiggins. This drought may not end this year, but the Timberwolves have some impressive building blocks for the future.
<h2>2. Sacramento Kings</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2006

The Kings are in the a perennial flux of front office chaos, but should contend (on paper) with a mix of proven veterans and talented younger players. Playing in the Western Conference will make ending this drought tough, however.
<h2>3. Detroit Pistons</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2009

The Pistons have some impressive pieces, but it’s definitely not enough to consider them contenders. The biggest factor working in their favor is the fact that they play in the Eastern Conference where a <a title="Eastern Conference Standings" href="http://espn.go.com/nba/standings" target="_blank">sub-.500 record can get you into the playoffs</a>.

<h2><strong>National Football League</strong></h2>
<h2>1. Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679947" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679947 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Marcell-Dareus-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jared Wickerham/Getty Images" width="757" height="563" /> Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>1999

It’s somewhat hard to believe the Bills have fallen on such hard times <a title="Buffalo Bills 1990's" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/14751/best-bills-team-ever-1990" target="_blank">given their dominance of the 1990s</a>. They recently decided to bench quarterback EJ Manuel in favor of Kyle Orton, which is a move that displays continued uncertainty at the most important position in the game. A solid defense may not be enough to end this drought in 2014.
<h2>2. Cleveland Browns and Oakland Raiders</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2002

There is no doubting the talent on the Browns roster. If some guy named Johnny Manziel (you may have heard of him) can emerge as an upper-echelon quarterback, this drought will end in a hurry.

The Raiders may currently be the biggest train wreck in the entire league. Not only to they flip quarterbacks (and coaches) as often as some cooks flip burgers, the raiders also have a talent-starved roster due to poor drafting in recent years. This drought will go on.
<h2>3.  St. Louis Rams</h2>
<strong>Last Playoff Appearance: </strong>2004

The Rams have one of the most talented defenses in the entire league. The problem for them is their quarterback situation -- Nick Foles is hardly a franchise savior -- and that they play in a ridiculously good division in the NFC West. If — and this is a big if — they can get above-average quarterback play in the future, this drought could easily come to an end.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[We happen to be at the end of July, folks! Translation: the weakest, most uneventful period throughout the entire sports calendar year. Since the actual sports season is in a slow period, we thought we’d celebrate the seventh month of the year with a list of the best athletes ever to rock the Number 7 on their jersey. This is for you, July -- you are all us sports fans have at the moment!
<h2>5. Nate “Tiny” Archibald</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831026" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831026 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Tiny-Archibald-Myrna-Suarez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NEW YORK - MAY 20:  (HOLLYWOOD REPORTER OUT)  (L-R) NBA Hall of Famers Willis Reed,  Nate &quot;Tiny&quot; Archibald and George &quot;Iceman&quot; Girvin attend the UJA-Federation of New York Dinner honoring Comcast executives Ralph Roberts and Brian Roberts at the Waldorf Astoria May 20, 2003 in New York City.

Tiny Archibald made his mark in the NBA through his first six seasons with the Cincinnati Royals (later the Kansas City Kings) with the jersey numbers of 1 and 10, roasting through defenses by slashing to the hole at will, using his adept speed and quickness in the open floor to drive opponents crazy, and dishing out assist after assist to his teammates at a high rate. He even led the NBA in scoring and assists per game during the 1973 season – the only player to ever do that in league history.

However, Tiny makes this list because of his Boston Celtic days wearing the No. 7 from 1978-1983. Tiny joined the storied Boston franchise in 1978 after being traded by the New Jersey Nets after a torn Achilles tendon and boy did he ever reinvigorate his career. Over the course of his five seasons with the Celtics as the starting point guard, Archibald averaged 12.4 ppg and 7.0 apg, helped lead the Celtics to the league’s best record three years in a row (1980-1982), made three All-Star Games, won the 1981 All-Star Game MVP, made an All-NBA Second Team (1981), and most importantly paired with Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Robert Parish, and Kevin McHale to win the 1981 NBA title. We had thoughts about taking Carmelo Anthony with the Knicks or David Beckham with Real Madrid (2003-2007) at this spot, but in the end we’ve got to ride with Tiny here at number five.

<h2>4. Ted Lindsay</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831069" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831069 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ted-Lindsay-Scott-A.-Schneider-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ST. PAUL, MN - OCTOBER 22:  Ted Lindsay poses with his  Lester Patrick Award October 22, 2008 at the St. Paul Hotel in St. Paul, Minnesota. (Photo by )" width="757" height="605" /> Scott A. Schneider/Getty Images[/caption]

&nbsp;

The hockey forward referred to as “Terrible Ted” teamed with a top-three all-time player in right winger Gordie Howe and centre Sid Abel with the Detroit Red Wings during the 1940s and 1950s to form “The Production Line.” The smaller Lindsay along with Howe and Abel formed a high-scoring hockey trio that helped the Red Wings capture four Stanley Cup trophies (1950, 1952, 1954, 1955).

While Gordie Howe was undoubtedly the team’s best player and in fact the NHL’s top player during at the time, Lindsay more than enough held his own on the ice. He scored over 800 points in his career, was an 9-time All-Star, won the Art Ross Trophy in 1950 as the league’s leading scorer, and is credited for starting a tradition of lifting the Stanley Cup and skating around the rink with the Cup so fans could get a close up look at the trophy. Lindsay is also responsible for organizing the first professional hockey players union in the late 1950s, the NHLPA, and gave the players a voice to speak on different issues surrounding the league.

Aside from that, Ted Lindsay will remembered as one of the best – if not the best – left winger in hockey history.

<h2>3. Phil Esposito</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831073 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Phil-Esposito-Olga-Maltseva-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Canada's Wayne Gretzky (L) and Phil Esposito smile during a press conference before a Legends Jubilee Games 2012 hockey match between teams Legend of Canada and Legend of USSR in St. Petersburg, Russia, on September 5, 2012.

&nbsp;

It could be argued that no forward in hockey during the 1960s and 1970s was as good as Phil Esposito. As a Boston Bruin, the 10-time NHL All-Star became the first player in history to accumulate 100 points in a season (1969). In 1971, he set the record for the most goals scored in a season (76), until it was later broken. In the same year, Esposito set the single-season record for most points scored (152), until that record was broken as well.

The bulky and strong Esposito took home five Art Ross Trophies in his career, led the league in goals scored in six straight seasons from 1969-1975, and along with the greatest defenseman in NHL history in Bobby Orr, formed one of the best tandems in hockey history that led the Bruins to Stanley Cup titles in 1970 and 1972.

Esposito does not only have a resolute place in the minds and hearts of long-standing Boston sports fans, but he will also be remembered as one of the finest forwards that ever skated on the ice.

<h2>2. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="DENVER, CO - JULY 8: Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway scrambles for yardage as he is pursued by Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Donnie Edwards during the Broncos season opener against the Chiefs 31 August in Denver, Colorado.

&nbsp;

There might not have been a better athlete to play the quarterback position in NFL history. Big, strong, excellent size, and a cannon arm are all the qualities Sir John carried when he walked on the football field. The high-prized No.1 pick in 1983 out of Stanford came into the NFL with as much expectation as maybe any QB ever and boy did he ever live up to the hype. At one point in time (especially during the mid-to-late 1980s), Elway happened to be the most feared quarterback in the game in late-game situations.

Just ask the Cleveland Browns about it in the 1986 AFC Championship Game. They still haven’t recovered from it.

The 9-time Pro Bowler drove opposing defenses crazy and had defensive coordinators guessing because of his unrivaled way of extending a play outside the pocket and the fear that he could and would squeeze bullet passes between defensive backs to get the ball to his receivers. Though it took 14 years, Elway’s unique play would help him finally win that elusive Super Bowl title in 1997 he so long wanted. The next year in 1998, he would win it again. Soon after his second Super Bowl win, Elway walked away from football on top as a champion.

At the time of his retirement, Elway was second all-time in passing yards (51,475), attempts (7,250), and completions (4,123). Elway was a rare kind of quarterback and one that will always be mentioned in the “Best Quarterback Ever” discussion.

<h2>1. Mickey Mantle</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831110" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831110 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mickey-Mantle-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: A general view of the Mickey Mantle plaque in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium on September 11, 2008 in the Bronx borough of New York City.

The battle for the “Best Athlete to Wear Number 7” was always a two-horse race between Elway and Mantle and choosing one over the other was surely difficult. In the end, we went with The Mick, who arguably accomplished a little bit more throughout his career than Elway did.

As the centerpiece and superstar player of the mighty and powerful New York Yankees in the 1950 and 1960s, the 20-time All-Star was a type of player that could impact the game in multiple ways that excited baseball fans and gave sportswriters of that time quite a ton to write about and report. The Mick could crush homeruns further than anyone. He could get on-base consistently. He could hit for a high average. His athleticism and quickness on the bases and his phenomenal ability to cover and track down balls in the outfield early in his career was only matched by his main rival, Willie Mays in those days. Mantle had about as much raw and natural talent as possibly any baseball player that’s ever played.

When you compare Mantle and Elway’s resume, than it’s obvious that the athlete who wore #7 and performed in pinstripes, put up a more impressive career. — Seven World Series titles, a three-time AL MVP with four AL Homerun titles. A Triple Crown winner. One of the best postseason hitters ever. The greatest switch hitter ever, and arguably the best pure power hitter of all-time behind Babe Ruth. An American Baseball Icon.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s world, it is more common to hear about the wrongdoings of professional athletes than it is to hear about the good things they are doing. With some help from <a title="Look To The Stars" href="https://www.looktothestars.org" target="_blank">Look To The Stars</a>, here’s a look at eight of the most charitable professional athletes of all time.
<h2>1. Tiger Woods</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746948" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746948 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tiger-Woods.jpg" alt="Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images" width="757" height="532" /> Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite his struggles inside and outside of the game of golf, Woods remains one of the most charitable athletes of all time. With the help of his late father, he started the Tiger Woods Foundation in 1996, which, according to the <a title="Tiger Woods Foundation" href="http://www.tigerwoodsfoundation.org/aboutTWF/whatWeDo" target="_blank">foundation’s website</a>, has “reached millions of young people by delivering unique experiences and innovative educational opportunities for youth worldwide.”

<h2>2. Ndamukong Suh</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746950" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746950 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ndamukong-Suh.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Suh has been named the dirtiest player in the NFL multiple times, but that hasn’t stopped him from being one of the most charitable players in league history. In 2011, he <a title="Suh's $2.6 Million Donation" href="http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=204930543" target="_blank">donated a whopping $2.6 million</a> to his alma mater, the University of Nebraska, and followed that up with a $250,000 donation to his former high school in 2013. The Detroit Lions defensive tackle also started the <a title="Ndamukong Suh Family Foundation" href="http://www.suhfoundation.org" target="_blank">Ndamukong Suh Family Foundation</a>, and has continued to donate millions of dollars throughout his five-year NFL career.

<h2>3. Eli Manning</h2>

Manning and his wife, Abby, were instrumental in <a title="Manning Raises $2.5 Million" href="http://www.parentdish.com/2011/07/25/football-star-eli-manning-scores-2-9-million-for-childrens-hos/" target="_blank">raising $2.5 million</a> for the the Eli Manning Children’s Clinics at the Blair E. Batson Hospital for Children, and also donated an <a title="Eli Manning And Wife Donate to Ole Miss" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8194b2e5/article/eli-manning-wife-donate-1m-to-ole-miss-scholarship-program" target="_blank">additional $1 million</a> to their alma mater, Ole Miss. Manning has also been an avid supporter of the March of Dimes, Red Cross, St. Francis Food Pantries and Shelters, and the Phoenix House.

While he took a lot of heat for “<a title="The Decision" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHSLw8DLm20" target="_blank">The Decision</a>," his 2010 announcement on where he would continue his career raised <a title="The Decision Profits Go To Charity" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/truehoop/miamiheat/news/story?id=6175574" target="_blank">$2.5 million</a> for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and an additional $3.5 million that was donated to various other charities. In addition, James has established the <a title="LeBron James Family Foundation" href="http://lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org" target="_blank">LeBron James Family Foundation</a> and has also supported After-School All-Stars, the Children’s Defense Fund, ONEXONE, and Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation.

<h2>5. Dikembe Mutombo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746953" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746953 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Dikembe-Mutombo-640x444.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="525" /> Stan Honda/Getty Images[/caption]

Mutombo is arguably the most generous athlete the world has ever seen. Aside from <a title="Mutombo Donates $15 Million For Congo Hospital" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2549321" target="_blank">spending $15 million on a hospital</a> in his native Congo, he has also been recognized as a Global Ambassador for the Special Olympics. The list of charities he supports include his own <a title="Dikembe Mutombo Foundation" href="http://www.dmf.org" target="_blank">Dikembe Mutombo Foundation</a>, FACE Africa, HOPE Worldwide, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Unicef, ONE Campaign, and Right to Play.

Agassi is another one of the most charitable athletes of all time. He founded the <a title="Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation" href="http://www.agassifoundation.org" target="_blank">Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation</a> and won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in 1995 for his charitable efforts. Some of his more notable work includes donating $35 million to help open the <a title="Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy" href="http://www.agassiprep.net" target="_blank">Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy</a>, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the Las Vegas area, and teaming up with several other athletes to found Athletes For Hope, an organization designed to help professional athletes get involved in charitable causes.

<h2>7. David Robinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746955" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746955 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/David-Robinson.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="1162" /> Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

For most of his illustrious NBA career, Robinson donated <a title="David Robinson's Philanthropy" href="http://www.nba.com/features/hoop_Mar00_robinson.html" target="_blank">10% of his income</a> to his charity, the David Robinson Foundation, and also invested countless hours of his time helping other people. The main focus of Robinson’s philanthropic work was based around education, and the crown jewel of his foundation is the Carver Academy in San Antonio. The Carver Academy is a college prep school in one of the poorest sections of San Antonio, and Robinson donated $5 million to make it become a reality.

<h2>8. Derek Jeter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746956" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-746956 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Derek-Jeter.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="495" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

Jeter, who was the face of the New York Yankees for 17 years, founded the <a title="Turn 2 Foundation" href="http://mlb.mlb.com/players/jeter_derek/turn2/index.jsp" target="_blank">Turn 2 Foundation</a> in 1996 to help teenagers avoid drugs and alcohol abuse, as well as to reward those with high levels of academic achievement. The foundation is still running strong today, with Jeter vowing to commit more time to the cause now that he is retired. Other notable charities Jeter supports are Stand Up To Cancer and the Entertainment Industry Foundation.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_777648" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rory-McIlroy.jpg"><img class="wp-image-777648 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Rory-McIlroy.jpg" alt="Rory McIlroy shoots at the PGA Championship" width="757" height="500" /></a> David Cannon/Getty Images[/caption]

Full disclosure: we never thought much about becoming professional golfers. That’s not to say we had the necessary skill to be a dominant force on the tour, but however you want to slice it, we simply never had the head for golf. After seeing what some of these guys pull in, though, boy do we regret not giving this game a go.

Not every golfer on the planet is making as much as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-highest-paid-athletes-in-2015.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">world’s highest-paid athletes</a>, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’re slumming it. According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes</a>, “The top 10 golfers earned an estimated total of $271 million in prize money, appearances, endorsements and golf course design fees between June 1, 2014 and June 1, 2015."

If you’ve ever tried to master the sport of golf, you understand why these athletes are making a pretty good living. The fact is, golf is hard. It’s all about muscle memory, mental fortitude, and focus. Some people have it, some don’t, and some simply stand above the rest. Who are these athletes? Luckily for us, Forbes did all the hard work. We’re just here to give you what you need.

With that in mind — discounting the highest-paid retired athletes — here’s a look at the five highest-paid golfers in 2015.

<h2>5. Jordan Spieth</h2>

Golf aficionados knew that Jordan Spieth could play the game at the highest level, but it wasn’t until his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-jordan-spieth-made-history-at-the-masters.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">record-tying performance at The Masters</a> this year that the rest of the world finally caught up to his star power. When the 21-year-old from Dallas shot an 18-under 270 at Augusta National — in a coast-to-coast victory — to capture his first green jacket, you knew the money would soon follow.

In 12 months, Spieth has pulled in $19.8 million in total earnings. He’s racked up $8.8 million from his winnings  — $1.8 million from The Masters alone — and made a solid $11 million in endorsements. Aside from a deal with Under Armour that runs through 2025, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdime/5-jordan-spieth/" target="_blank">Forbes reports</a> that the No. 2 golfer in the world also has partnerships with AT&amp;T, Titleist and Rolex.

<h2>4. Justin Rose</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total earnings</span>: $20.2 million</li>

	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Endorsements</span>: $12 million</li>
</ul>
As the No. 5 golfer in the world, England’s Justin Rose has parlayed his success on the course into great wealth off of it. In the past 12 months, the 2013 U.S. Open Champion has made $12 million in endorsements, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdime/4-justin-rose/" target="_blank">courtesy of his partnerships</a> with companies such as Adidas, Ashworth, British Airways, Hublot, Lamkin, TaylorMade and Zurich Insurance.

In the last year, Rose has also brought in $8.2 million from his winnings. The <a href="http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.22405.justin-rose.html/season" target="_blank">2015 PGA Tour season</a> has certainly been kind to this talented golfer. So far in 2015, in 11 events, Rose has three top 10 finishes, a second place finish, and a victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. Rose has finished inside the top 6 in the year-end golf rankings in each of the past three seasons. Given how well he’s been playing, we expect that trend to continue.

<h2>3. Rory McIlroy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_714232" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rory-McIlroy-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-714232" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rory-McIlroy-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Rory McIlroy chips during the PGA Grand Slam of Golf" width="757" height="528" /></a> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Earnings</span>: $48.3 million</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salary/Winnings</span>: $16.3 million</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Endorsements</span>: $32 million</li>
</ul>
The World No. 1 may only be the third highest paid golfer in 2015, but <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdime/3-rory-mcilroy/" target="_blank">$48.3 million in total earnings</a> is nothing to cry about. Over the last year, Rory McIlroy has won five PGA victories, two majors, and amassed $16.3 million in winnings. Of course, the money he’s pulled in from his play on the tour is nothing compared to the loot from his endorsements.

McIlroy makes a pretty penny on account of his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/01/14/rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-nike-golf/1832579/" target="_blank">lucrative deal with Nike</a>, but the swoosh isn’t the only brand that pays this kid to rock its gear. On top of being the new face of Electronic Arts — for its golf video game — McIlroy is in business with Bose, Omega, and Upper Deck. If there was ever a golf player worth investing your money in at the moment, it would have to be the 26-year-old from Northern Ireland.

<h2>2. Tiger Woods</h2>
[caption id="attachment_813103" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiger-Woods-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-e1434383941466.jpg"><img class="wp-image-813103 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiger-Woods-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-e1434383941466.jpg" alt="Tiger Woods shoots at The Memorial" width="757" height="535" /></a> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Earnings</span>: $50.6 million</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salary/Winnings</span>: $600,000</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Endorsements</span>: $50 million</li>
</ul>
Tiger Woods’s struggles on the golf course — only making $600,000 from winnings in the past 12 months — have played a major part in him dropping to No. 2 on the list of highest-paid golfers. And yet, despite his current lack of game, nothing seems to prevent the 14-time Majors champion from raking in the big bucks.

In the last year, Tiger has brought in added $50 million to his purse in endorsement money alone. Nike still keeps Woods living large, to the tune of over $20 million a year, but the apparel giant isn’t the only brand that keeps itself in the Tiger Woods business. In 2014, Woods <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdime/2-tiger-woods/" target="_blank">signed deals with companies such as MusclePharm and India’s Hero motorcycles</a>. If you throw in the fact that Tiger is starting to make some money off his golf course-design firm, then it’s easy that while Woods may have 99 problems, money is certainly not one.

<h2>1. Phil Mickelson</h2>

</ul>
Put your hands together and break out the golf for the lefty.

With a whopping <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdime/1-phil-mickelson/" target="_blank">$50.8 million earned</a> in the past year, Phil Mickelson has usurped Woods on the Forbes list of highest-paid golfers. Since becoming a pro in 1992, Mickelson has accumulated $77 million in total prize money. This past year he only brought in $2.8 million from his play on the course. However, it’s the $48 million is raked in from endorsement deals, that put Mickelson over the top.

According to Forbes, “Lefty" pulls in this kind of dough from his association with companies such as Callaway, Barclays, KPMG, Exxon Mobil, Rolex and Amgen. Not bad for a guy who hasn’t won a tournament since 2013. Still, when you take into account that Mickelson has 42 PGA wins and five Majors in his career, it’s no surprise that he continues to be one of the most popular guys on the tour. The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/06/15/mickelson-tops-woods-as-golfs-highest-paid-player/" target="_blank">$600 million he’s made during his career</a> from prize money, appearances, and endorsements are still second in comparison to Tiger’s overall haul. However, as long as we choose to focus on earnings from the past 12 months, Phil Mickelson is second to none.

		<description><![CDATA[$20k was offered for the ball Jermaine Kearse caught to win the NFC Championship. How does this price compare to history's most expensive sports memorabilia?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_749286" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-749286 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jermaine-Kearse.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="756" height="504" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

When wide receiver Jermaine Kearse hauled in the 35-yard pass from Russell Wilson for the game-winning overtime touchdown in the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, he was clearly pent up with a plethora of emotions. In what had to have been a cathartic moment, Kearse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=84359240&amp;v=Mx2pcCQlr28&amp;x-yt-ts=1421782837" target="_blank">chucked the football into the stands</a>, and the celebration for the Seattle Seahawks’ second-straight trip to the Super Bowl was officially underway.

However, immediately after launching that ball into the ether, Kearse was filled with regret. He had given away a piece of Seahawks history. This was a bad decision on his part. Fortunately for Kearse and the Seahawks organization, it looks like that ball is going to be returned to the receiver who made the big play. Seattle fan <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2336178-seahawks-fan-turned-down-20k-for-gw-td-ball-giving-it-to-jermaine-kearse" target="_blank">Scott Shelton, rather than take the $20k</a> offered to him by a sports memorabilia dealer, is giving the ball back to its rightful owner. Now, that’s the move of a true fan.

Kearse plans on compensating Shelton for his gesture, but still that’s a lot of money to turn down. But, in the world of sports, history means money. And that price, albeit high, doesn’t even come close to the amount of money received for some of the bigger ticket items.

<h2>7. Babe Ruth’s bat</h2>
Price sold for: $1,265,000

Babe Ruth hit a lot of home runs during his career as a major league ballplayer — <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_career.shtml" target="_blank">714, in fact</a>. However, there is always something special about a first. It’s where the journey begins. And for Ruth, joining the New York Yankees was just another step toward greatness. So, when he crushed his first home run at Yankee Stadium, it meant something. This was the bat used to hit that ball.

And thus, <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/stadium_history.jsp" target="_blank">‘The House That Ruth Built</a>" was christened.

<h2>6. Paul Henderson’s ’72 Summit Series jersey</h2>
Price sold for: $1,275,707

In 1972, the Canadian hockey team took on the Soviet Union in an eight-game series known as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/sports/hockey/in-hockeys-1972-summit-series-between-canada-and-soviet-union-cold-war-got-colder.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">The Summit Series.</a> During this power-house matchup, Paul Henderson scored three game-winning goals for team Canada, and, therefore, cemented his legendary status.

People will be huge money to be a part of history. And Henderson’s performance was certainly historical.

<h2>5. Sheffield F.C. rulebook</h2>
Price sold for: $1, 400,000

Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Therefore, it’s no surprise that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-14153913" target="_blank">first pamphlet depicting the rules of the game would sell</a> for so much. Handwritten in 1857, this piece is believed to be the oldest rulebook in history. And it belonged to the first-ever professional club, Sheffield F.C.

Many of the rules in the notebook are still used in the sport today.

<h2>4. Honus Wagner baseball card</h2>
Price sold for: $2,800,000

The most expensive baseball card of all-time does not feature a player many would think. Rather, the face on the card belongs to Honus Wagner. Considered to be the <a href="http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/honus-wagner-card-1909/" target="_blank">the holy grail of baseball cards</a>, the reason it’s valued so high is because there were only a limited number ever printed.

The card that sold for this high amount of money was very rare, and in great condition.

<h2>3. Mark McGwire’s 70th home run ball</h2>
Price sold for: $3,000,000

Although the long balls of this former home run champ are now considered tainted, it doesn’t mean they weren’t valued at the time. Mark McGwire crushed <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1998-batting-leaders.shtml" target="_blank">70 home runs in 1998</a>, and his final one sold for quite a pretty penny. Sports fanatic Todd McFarlane was more than willing to <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V119/N3/homerun.3w.html" target="_blank">fork over $3 million</a> for this prized possession.

At this number, it’s safe to say that McGwire’s home run ball is in a league of its own.

<h2>2. James Naismith’s founding rules of basketball</h2>
Price sold for: $4,338,500

The popularity of the sport of basketball is undeniable. Not to mention, the stars who play this game are some of the most recognizable athletes on the planet. However, without proper rules, there would be no game. Which is why the father of basketball, <a href="http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/james-naismith/12154" target="_blank">Jam</a>e<a href="http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/james-naismith/12154" target="_blank">s Naismith</a>, wrote them down in 1891.

These founding documents are among the most important pieces of sports history. Although it would seem that the birth certificate of basketball would be priceless, it appears that was not the case. All it took was a little over $4 million.

<h2>1. Babe Ruth Jersey</h2>
Price sold for: $4,415,658

Babe Ruth, the Great Bambino, is baseball. He is probably the best the sport has ever seen — and will ever see. So it makes perfect sense that something belonging to this icon would sell for the most amount of money. The article of clothing that tops this list: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/babe-ruth-yankees-jersey-sells-record-setting-4-4m-auction-lawrence-taylor-super-bowl-ring-fetches-230k-article-1.1081557" target="_blank">Ruth’s jersey from 1920</a>.

This jersey is thought to be the oldest known Babe Ruth Yankee jersey in existence. There is simply nothing else like this out there. Once again, the Babe makes history.

		<description><![CDATA[The UConn women had their 47-game win streak snapped this week, a far cry from their record of 90 straight wins. Here are other famous sports winning streaks.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_726333" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-726333 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/166182898-640x464.jpg" alt="Chris Graythen/Getty Images" width="640" height="464" /> Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

When the No. 1 UConn women’s basketball team dropped an <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=400590356" target="_blank">88-86 heartbreaker</a> in overtime at No. 6 Stanford in November, they put an end to the two-time defending national champions’ 47-game winning streak. For most programs, 47 wins in a row would be an all-time record. But, not at Connecticut. Geno Auriemma’s dynasty once put together a string of 90 consecutive victories, a run which ironically also ended in a loss at Stanford back in 2010.

In honor of the Huskies’ dominance, we thought we’d take a look back through the record books at some of the other longest and most famous winning streaks in sports history. Where do <em>you</em> think they stack up with UConn’s women’s basketball record of 90? (Streaks are listed in ascending order of victories.)
<h4>NHL: Pittsburgh Penguins</h4>
The Penguins <a href="http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=546421" target="_blank">put together</a> 17 victories in a row in 1993 after superstar Mario Lemieux returned from radiation treatment for Hodgkin’s Disease. Pittsburgh won every game it played for more than a month, as the streak spanned from March 9 to April 10. The Penguins captain was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/10/sports/hockey-lemieux-and-penguins-turn-garden-into-5-and-10.html" target="_blank">the driving force</a>, tallying a whopping 27 goals and 23 assists during the streak.
<h4>NFL: New England Patriots</h4>
The Patriots <a href="www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/" target="_blank">won a total</a> of 21 consecutive games from October 2003 to October 2004, including a 32-29 victory over Carolina in Super Bowl XXXVIII. While the Pats’ string wouldn’t last through the entire 2004 regular season, New England did go on to defend its Super Bowl crown the following February. Of course, that’s not New England’s only impressive streak of the Brady/Belichick era, as the 2007 team put together a perfect 16-0 regular season.

<h4>MLB: New York Giants</h4>
The longest winning streak in Major League Baseball history, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/rare_feats/index.jsp?feature=winning_streaks" target="_blank">according to MLB.com</a>, belongs to the then-New York Giants, who won 26 straight in September 1916. The Giants <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NY1/NY1191609182.shtml" target="_blank">did tie</a> once during that time, as a game against Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYG/1916-schedule-scores.shtml" target="_blank">was called</a> before the ninth inning due to weather. For those looking for something more modern and in recent memory, an honorable mention shout-out goes to the 2002 Oakland Athletics, <a href="http://m.athletics.mlb.com/news/article/36925248/" target="_blank">who set</a> the American League record with 20 wins in a row.
<h4>NBA: Los Angeles Lakers</h4>
The longest winning streak in NBA history belongs to the L.A. Lakers, <a href="http://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/03/27/los-angeles-lakers-33-game-win-streak-miami-heat" target="_blank">who captured</a> 33 victories in a row during the 1971-1972 season. Wilt Chamberlain (pictured), Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Pat Riley, and company didn’t lose a game <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1972_games.html" target="_blank">for more</a> than two months, a streak that may never be topped (although the Miami Heat gave it a valiant effort last year before their string <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nba--chicago-bulls-end-miami-heat-s-27-game-winning-streak-025042967.html" target="_blank">finally ended</a> at 27 consecutive wins).
<h4>Division I college football: Oklahoma</h4>
The Oklahoma Sooners own the Division I <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2012/fbs.pdf" target="_blank">record for</a> most college football wins in a row, piling up 47 straight triumphs in the 1950’s. After a season-opening loss to top-ranked Notre Dame in 1953, OU didn’t come up short on the scoreboard again until November of 1957, when the Sooners faced — guess who? — the Fighting Irish and dropped a 7-0 decision. All told, Oklahoma enjoyed a span of <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/notre-dame-ends-oklahoma-record-winning-streak" target="_blank">more than</a> 1,500 days without tasting defeat.
<h4>College football: Mount Union</h4>
Division III Mount Union (OH)’s football program has assembled a dynasty that may never be matched in college athletics. Mount Union won 54 games in a row <a href="http://athletics.mountunion.edu/sports/fball/records/54_game_win_streak" target="_blank">from 1996 to 1999</a>, then promptly broke their own record by stringing together 55 more consecutive wins <a href="http://athletics.mountunion.edu/sports/fball/records/55_game_win_streak" target="_blank">from 2000 to 2003</a>. <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/games/2005-10-23-mount-union_x.htm" target="_blank">From 1994 to 2005</a>, the Purple Raiders won an unbelievable 110 regular-season games in a row. Oh, and Mount Union’s dominance isn’t all in the past, as the school <a href="http://athletics.mountunion.edu/sports/fball/2014-15/releases/201411156jt0dv" target="_blank">is currently</a> in the midst of a 93-game regular-season winning streak and has won 80 consecutive home games.

<h4>Men’s college basketball: UCLA</h4>
John Wooden’s <a href="http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/john-wooden/life-and-times/" target="_blank">UCLA Bruins </a>were known for winning national championships, as the folks in Westwood got to hang title banners in 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975. Included in that <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/ucla/" target="_blank">legendary run</a> of 10 titles in 12 years (and seven in a row) was a winning streak that lasted from 1971 to 1974, or a total of 88 games.
<h4>Women’s college basketball: UConn</h4>
See above. The Huskies <a href="http://www.courant.com/sports/uconn-women/hc-ucwom-streak-story.html" target="_blank">didn’t lose a game</a> from November 2008 to December 2010, a 90-game streak of victories that included two of Geno Auriemma’s nine national championships.
<h4>High school football: De La Salle</h4>
The De La Salle (CA) Spartans <a href="http://www.maxpreps.com/list/all_time_streaks.aspx?gendersport=boys,football#" target="_blank">became the first team</a> in high school football history to win 100 games in a row, <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_26447521/night-de-la-salles-streak-ended" target="_blank">finishing with</a> a record streak of 151 victories between 1992 and 2003. (To put that run in perspective, one George Bush was president when the streak began, and the other George Bush was president when it concluded.) De La Salle’s monumental accomplishment <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/other/story/bob-ladouceur-de-la-salle-151-game-win-streak-when-the-game-stands-tall-082614" target="_blank">hit the big screen</a> this year in <em>When the Game Stands Tall</em>, a movie starring Jim Caviezel as DLS coach Bob Ladouceur.
<h4>Basketball: Harlem Globetrotters</h4>
While Harlem Globetrotters exhibitions (pictured) are quite a bit less competitive than the other teams, games, and sports mentioned on this list (to put it kindly), the Globetrotters still deserve recognition for a <a href="http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/history/1971-globetrotters-begin-24-year-winning-streak" target="_blank">winning streak</a> that lasted <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/20149/the-33-best-streaks-in-sports-history" target="_blank">2,495 games</a> before the New Jersey Reds snapped it in 1971 (on a last-second shot by a <a href="http://washingtongeneralsfan.blogspot.com/2011/06/washington-generals-infamous-1971-win.html" target="_blank">50-year-old</a> player/coach, no less!). The Globetrotters weren’t fazed by the rare defeat, as they began a new streak the next night, one that span the next 24 years before the best entertainers in basketball lost again.

Sports are America’s favorite pastime, but have we taken our obsession with football, baseball, basketball, and other recreational games too far? These days, it seems as if America’s No. 1 priority isn’t peace, equality, justice, or caring for our fellow Americans — it’s sports.

America worships sportsmen and sportswomen to such an extreme that many are willing to turn a blind eye to criminal allegations levied against professional athletes, that school coaches are paid more than teachers and professors, that millions are eager to put their lives on hold just to make sure the big game is seen — and the post-game review, too.

Here are 10 reasons why sports have become America’s No. 1 priority.

<h4>1. Sports are a priority in high schools</h4>
Investigative journalist Amanda Ripley first delved into the problem of America’s obsession with sports in “The Smartest Kids in the World,” a book that examines the issues of over-prioritizing sports in high schools by comparing the differences between Poland’s educational system and America’s.

Polish high schoolers are outscoring American high school students in both math and science since Poland eradicated sports teams from their high schools entirely. America’s high schools, on the other hand, are often entirely based around sports. An <a href="http://evolvingenglishteacher.blogspot.com/2013/09/sports-defining-priorities-in-american.html" target="_blank">entire week dedicated to homecoming</a>, pep rallies, leadership groups to plan these festivities, and long travel times to games all support the case that America is prioritizing sports much more than is appropriate.

Sports are such a priority in our high schools that oftentimes, entire summers are dedicated to cultivating high school sports teams, with days filled with long practice and drill sessions. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/09/have-sports-teams-brought-down-americas-schools.html" target="_blank">Ripley</a> points out that if a math teacher were to request a Saturday or summertime drill session, kids and parents alike would probably be outraged.

Among 74 countries, America’s high school students rank 31st in math and 17th in reading, and Ripley blames that on sports seeming to be the No. 1 priority in American schools.

&nbsp;
<h4>2. Sports are a priority in college</h4>
Sports are a priority in American universities, too. Not only do students interested in becoming professional athletes often spend their college years grooming themselves for an attempt to go pro, but many institutions are geared to encourage this, some even “specializing” in a specific sport and being considered the “go to” college for hopefuls.

<a href="http://triblive.com/opinion/editorials/3313994-74/per-priorities-schools#axzz2ngUxImfc" target="_blank">Reports</a> by the American Institutes of Research’s Delta Cost Project have shown that NCAA Division I colleges spend “three to six times more on each of their athletes than educating each of their students.” Studies showed that the median spending on football in 2010 was $92,000 per athlete; some colleges spend more than $100,000 per year per athlete. This is evidence that sports are way too much of a priority in American universities, but it doesn’t look as though anything is being done to change it.

<h4>3. <strong>Little chance for advancement doesn’t stop over-prioritizing</strong></h4>
With the emphasis and priority that schools place on athletes to compete successfully, one would think that the advancement from college football player (or any other sport) to professional athlete would be relatively common. But this is not the case. In reality, very few college athletes go on to have successful careers as professionals. Despite this daunting fact, sports are no less of a priority in America, and schools and parents continue to put an exaggerated amount of emphasis on the importance of sports players’ performances.

The <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/does-society-place-too-mu_b_1569299.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> notes that the sports industry is a “big, wide-ranging investment with a tiny proportion of people reaping any rewards at all and ‘collateral damage’ as a necessary by-product.”

<h4>4. <strong>Schools cover for their athletes</strong></h4>
Besides the amount of misappropriated funds and time spent on college sports and individual athletes, the importance of sports is elevated even further by the way school coaches and administrations are willing to cover for the misbehavior of their star athletes — and the way that America seems to condone this sort of behavior.

In Tallahassee, Florida, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/12/college-football-sexual-assualt-jameis-winston" target="_blank">the police force</a> allegedly discouraged a woman from filing charges for rape against someone who just happened to be the quarterback at Florida State University, since the city was a “big football town” that would most likely mistreat her for standing up for herself. This is not an isolated case.

Mother Jones compiled a long list of alleged sexual assaults that have been supposedly brushed aside or overlooked because those facing charges were key players in some college sports team. The list stretches all the way back to 1974 and has dozens of examples.

<h4>5. <strong>Hero worship</strong></h4>
America worships athletes as heroes to an absurd extent, a sad truth on a number of levels. Not only is it a gross injustice, but this is part of the way America denies itself the ability to take proper advantage of all the minds working as scientists, humanitarians, artists, and engineers. Instead, the U.S. is prioritizing sporting events and giving way too much credit to those who play them. Ask yourself what sports players contribute to society besides simple entertainment, and you will be hard pressed to come up with much.

<h4>6. Overinflated salaries</h4>
It’s no secret that professional athletes are incredibly overpaid. LeBron James<a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nba/cleveland-cavaliers/lebron-james/" target="_blank"> makes over $20 million per year</a>, which is amazing, considering that the average <a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary/Scientist.html" target="_blank">scientist’s yearly salary</a> is $77,000. While James is getting paid millions to throw a ball into a hoop, many teachers — responsible for the education of America’s youth (and, indirectly, the future of the nation) — are <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/2011-2012-average-starting-teacher-salary.html" target="_blank">struggling just to put food on the table</a> with their average $35,672 per year. <em><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/366795-do-athletes-get-paid-too-much-money" target="_blank">Bleacher Report</a> </em>points out that every basket scored by Kobe Bryant is equivalent to the average teacher’s yearly salary.

Would America’s police force be better and more highly refined if officer salaries were even close to that of a professional athlete? Would NASA be able to do more research or launch further space missions if America wasn’t so busy over-prioritizing sports and if the priority was funding the professions of scientists and <a href="http://www.prosebeforehos.com/sports-editor/03/08/what-do-athletes-salaries-say-about-american-values/" target="_blank">engineers</a>?

<h4>7. <strong>Teachers earn less than coaches</strong></h4>
Not only do teachers earn less than professional athletes, <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/25/5/1433.full" target="_blank">some even earn less</a> than coaches at their own schools. In Texas, football coaches earn an average of approximately $31,000 more per year than teachers, bringing their average salaries to $73,804; teachers in the state make about $42,400. And 27 of those Texas coaches earn even more than the school principal. It’s not just Texas: Many colleges dole out <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/10/the-case-against-high-school-sports/309447/" target="_blank">higher salaries</a> and stipends to coaches than to professors.

<h4>8. The high <strong>value of America’s sports industries</strong></h4>
The huge salaries of professional athletes are, unfortunately, the fault of countless fans who are willing to put their lives on hold and pour large amounts of money into tickets, Pay-Per-View rentals, sports memorabilia, gear, and other team-related merchandise. America’s sports industry is worth a whopping <a href="http://www.omg-facts.com/Sports/The-American-Sports-Industry-Is-Worth-42/53738" target="_blank">$422 billion</a>, employing 1 percent of the population with almost 3 million sports-related jobs. And that does not include the salaries of professional athletes.

The <a href="http://hockeygearhq.com/business-sports-comparing-nhl-nfl-nba-mlb-jobs-industry-3545" target="_blank">NFL generates $9 billion per year</a>, and the MLB comes in second, with $7.2 billion.

Fans go insane when it comes to collecting sports memorabilia and attending games, and both are only becoming more expensive — but fans aren’t becoming any less interested. The 2013 World Series’ Game 6 was named “the most expensive baseball ticket in history,” with standing room-only tickets being sold at <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/mlb--world-series-game-6-is-the-most-expensive-baseball-ticket-in-history-192252713.html" target="_blank">$900 each</a>. Both the demand and the reckless enthusiasm to buy tickets at any cost are reasons for this needless inflation, and those printing price tags know this well enough to continue pumping money out of the herd of sports enthusiasts who are willing to dole it out.

<h4>9. <strong>An emphasis on winning</strong></h4>
It’s not just sports that have become America’s No. 1 priority, but the act of <a href="https://www.competitivedge.com/when-winning-becomes-too-important" target="_blank">winning</a>, as well. To America, winning equates to a successful and admirable person — and that’s what youth are taught to believe, as well. The giant salaries of professional athletes and the emphasis given to sports in school and our booming sports industry all have a hidden undertone: Winning is more important than anything, and winners make the most money and have the most worth. Indiscretions go unnoticed, lives are enriched with money, and everything is generally better for those who know how to win.

And yet, it’s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/parents-ruin-sports-for-their-kids-by-obsessing-about-winning/280442/" target="_blank">scientifically proven</a> that too much of an emphasis on winning — instead of learning and doing — is detrimental to the development of children.

<h4>10. Excessive m<strong>edia coverage</strong></h4>
Ripley, the investigative journalist, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/09/have-sports-teams-brought-down-americas-schools.html" target="_blank">points out</a> that it’s not uncommon for multiple reporters to show up at “big” school games. Super Bowl commercial spots are the most expensive advertisements of the year, and football season sees games absolutely dominating television networks. The priority is not educational shows or programs teaching important values, but sports.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_623395" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-623395" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tiger-Woods_Timothy-A.-Clary_Getty-Images-1-640x436.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="515" /> Tiger Woods | Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images[/caption]

Americans have a particular relationship with money that seems potent. More than any other first world nation, the U.S. is driven by the acquisition of assets. It rules everything around us, like the Wu Tang Clan explained in 1993. Subsequently, our culture showers the most visibly great with the most visible bling.

Nike had $3.8 billion in endorsement commitments this last year, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/06/05/the-worlds-highest-paid-athletes-2013-behind-the-numbers/" target="_blank">according to Forbes</a>. Obviously, Nike doesn’t just deal with American athletes, but many of the most famous athletes are American, and a lot of them have deals that make them wear Nike shoes. Athletes exist in a constant state of competition. They’re hardwired into it -- that’s why they make the personal sacrifices necessary in order to become professionals in the first place, because they’re determined to prove they are that good.

No one makes it into the highest level of pro sports by accident. Call it Jordan Syndrome. Call it whatever you want. These athletes are in competition off the clock, too, comparing incomes and outspending each other on the finer things in life. Here are the richest American athletes, with figures gathered from <a href="http://www.therichest.com" target="_blank">TheRichest.com</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/" target="_blank">Forbes,</a> and <a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/" target="_blank">CelebrityNetWorth</a>.
<h2>10. Shaquille O’Neal – $250 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497011" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497011" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shaq-Lisa-Lake-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="500" /> Shaquille O'Neal | Lisa Lake/Getty Images[/caption]

The Shaqtus. The Big Aristotle. The $250 million man. Shaquille O’Neal, the sixth all-time leading NBA scorer, four time NBA champion, and biggest personality in the sports universe, has managed to keep his finances in check beyond his 18-year basketball career.

A media presence who defies the word "big," Shaq has made movies, video games, and rap records; he has been a member of TNT’s Emmy-winning<em> Inside the NBA</em> and, as of 2013, is a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings, a franchise that saw its championship hopes dashed by Shaq during his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Shaq has never been shy about being flashy, and in 1993, well before he made his big money, he recorded this classic jam from his platinum album Shaq Diesel. It’s definitely, uh, a thing that Shaq did. It’s called “I’m Outstanding.” Again, this is from a platinum record. It sold one million copies back when people still bought CDs.

Golf is not a cheap sport, so it makes sense that Jack Nicklaus -- one of the best golfers of all time -- shows up on this list. Holding down a record 18 career championships, the 74-year-old golfer has been a pro since 1961, raking in that athlete cash for over 50 years. He also wrote the seminal golf instruction manual <em>Golf My Way</em>, which was first published in 1974 and remains in print to this day.

Nicklaus was instrumental in the founding of IMG, the media company now based out of New York City. Along with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, Nicklaus was one of the first three athletes to sign with the management company, laying the groundwork for one of the most influential endorsement agencies in sports history.

With a speaking schedule and a full off-the-green slate of appearances and licensing fees, Nicklaus made a staggering $28 million a year as recently as 2012 -- only one tenth of his estimated net worth. Nicklaus also founded Nicklaus Design, a design firm that crafts world-class golf courses. The legend has been involved with at least 290 of the 300+ courses designed by the group, <a href="http://www.nicklaus.com/design/overview.php" target="_blank">per the company’s website</a>.

<h2>8. Don King – $290 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497013" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497013" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Don-King-Theo-Wargo-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="504" /> Don King | Theo Wargo/Getty Images[/caption]

While Don King is not an athlete in the technical sense -- he never competed at a professional level in a sporting event -- he has been inextricably linked with the rise of boxing and is far and away the most famous promoter in the country. And, besides all that, King’s efforts certainly constitute as much work as training for the actual matches, especially in the shady world of watching people punch each other.

King made his bones in the boxing world after convincing Muhammad Ali to fight in a match that would help support a black hospital in Cleveland that was about to close its doors. After that, the floodgates opened, and, as <a href="http://grantland.com/features/don-king-faces-end-career/" target="_blank">Grantland’s Jay Caspian Kang put it</a>, “Don King has nostalgia by the balls. Fights are best enjoyed through old film, which means that if you want to watch Muhammad Ali or Larry Holmes or Mike Tyson or Julio Cesar Chavez or Evander Holyfield raise his arms in triumph at the end of a fight, you’re also going to see the big man with the bigger hair climbing in through the ropes.”

King was an integral part of boxing’s rise, even though the cleanliness of King’s money is in question. Beyond the Mob associations that boxing has always had through its connection with gambling, he has routinely stiffed boxers that he helped champion -- his pole position on this list cannot be in doubt. Only in America, indeed.
<h2>7. Dale Earnhardt Jr. – $300 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497014" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497014" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Dale-Earnhardt-Jr.-Jerry-Markland-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="504" /> Dale Earnhardt Jr. | Jerry Markland/Getty Images[/caption]

From punching people in the face to perpetually turning left, spot No. 7 on this list is also the place for the highest earning “junior” in American sports. Earnhardt, who is the son of the Hall of Fame NASCAR driver of the same name, has reportedly pulled in over $300 million from endorsements and race victories. He has won two Daytona 500 races (’04 and ’14), and won the “most popular racer” award every year from 2003 to 2013.

Beyond racing, Earnhardt is the principle owner of Hammerhead Entertainment, which produces <em>Back In The Day</em> for the Fox Sports Speed Channel. The driver also owns a pair of bars, as well as a car dealership. Because of course he does. <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-05-15/dale-earnhardt-jr-highest-paid-driver-athletes-salary-endorsements-sponsors" target="_blank">According to <em>Sporting News</em></a>, Earnhardt had sponsorship deals with Diet Mountain Dew, Chevrolet, TaxSlayer.com, Nationwide Insurance, National Guard, and Hellmann’s as of 2012.

<h2>6. Alex Rodriguez – $300 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_484268" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-484268" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Alex-Rodriguez-Streeter-LeckaGetty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="511" /> Alex Rodriquez | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

How rich is Alex Rodriquez? He’s so rich that he owns both the No. 1 and the No. 2 spots on the “largest American sports contracts ever” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_sports_contracts" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>, having inked a $252 million deal with the Texas Rangers in 2001 and following that up with a contract with the New York Yankees worth $275 million in 2008. Good money if you can get it.

The wiki page also, helpfully, breaks down each deal into a per/contest average, so you can easily see that Alex Rodriguez has made more money, per game, than the GDP of Vietnam since 2001. For each one of the 162 baseball games that make up a season. Yeah. He’s made a bunch of money. Unlike many of his contemporaries on this list, Rodriguez “earns very little in endorsement deals,” <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/alex-rod-rodriguez-banned-baseball-hell-construction/story?id=19842245" target="_blank">according to <em>ABCSports</em></a><em>.</em> Very little, we assume, is relative.

A-Rod took a bit of a hit with his upcoming suspension, though, since he’ll miss the entire 2014 season on a steroid suspension. He forfeited at least $25 million dollars in salary, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-13/rodriguez-loses-far-more-than-25-million-salary-in-2014-mlb-ban.html" target="_blank">according to <em>Bloomberg News</em></a>. Which is a lot of money to lose, but somehow we think he’ll be fine.
<h2>5. Tiger Woods – $500 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_471337" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-471337" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tiger-Woods-Andrew-Redington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="465" /> Tiger Woods | Andrew Redington/Getty Images[/caption]

Surprised he’s this low? Woods, the legendary golfer who broke $1 billion in career earnings back in January, or so says <em>Golfer’s Digest</em> (<a href="http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/10257010/tiger-woods-hits-13-billion-career-earnings-report-says" target="_blank">via ESPN</a>), made $78 million last year, mostly off endorsements. That’s not a surprise, as Woods hasn’t been at the top of the PGA tour for a while now, despite still being near the top of the golf world’s collective rankings.

<em>Golfer’s Digest</em> estimated that almost 90% of Tiger’s $1.16 billion take came from endorsements, noting that the golfer had earned over $100 million from his sponsors in 2008 and 2009, a figure that dropped all the way down to $62 million in the wake of his messy, and public, divorce.

With Woods <a title="Tiger Woods: Will He Ever Hold a Major Trophy Again?" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports-2/tiger-woods-will-he-ever-hold-a-major-trophy-again.html/" target="_blank">struggling to regain his championship form</a>, and his lucrative partnerships with EA and others reaching their end, it remains to be seen how the golfer will respond in his new business ventures. Like Nicklaus, Woods is the head of a golf course design firm, Tiger Woods Design, that he founded in 2006.

<h2>4. Magic Johnson – $500 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497017" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497017" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Magic-Johnson-Chelsea-Lauren-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="551" /> Magic Johnson | Chelsea Lauren/Getty Images[/caption]

Magic Johnson, the point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers during the Showtime Era -- which turned the NBA from an also-ran American sports league into an international phenomenon -- is quite well off. He was able to parlay his $18 million earnings from his sixteen-year NBA career into Magic Johnson Enterprises, a billion-dollar company that has managed to snag Magic a comfortable personal net worth of $500 million.

Johnson, who made headlines in 2012 when he led a group purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2 billion, has also done basketball commentary for ESPN, as well as promoted a number of noble and altruistic causes. Publicly HIV positive since 1991, Johnson has contributed heavily to AIDS/HIV activism.
<h2>3. Michael Jordan – $650 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497018" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497018" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Michael-Jordan-Andrew-Redington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="516" /> Michael Jordan | Andrew Redington/Getty Images[/caption]

The highest basketball player on this list, Michael Jordan is perhaps the most brand-esque athlete in the history of sports. While other athletes are inseparable from their sponsors, Jordan is his own sponsor. At least, that’s what it feels like. While Jordan shoes are technically a subset of Nike, they may as well be their own line -- with their own series of endorsed basketball players and all.

Also, there’s the whole Jordan-as-godhead thing that he definitely pulled off, a combination of the spread of technology before the rise of social media. So for the most famous athlete in the world, money gets stacked pretty fast.

While Jordan was, by today’s standards, criminally underpaid by the Chicago Bulls (total NBA salary: $90 million over 13 seasons), his endorsement deals with Gatorade, Hanes, and 2k Sports have more than shored up the gap. In 2013, 10 years after his retirement, His Airness still pulled $60 million, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/02/14/how-michael-jordan-still-earns-80-million-a-year/" target="_blank">according to Forbes</a>. Seems like being like Mike is still a pretty admirable goal.

<h2>2. Arnold Palmer – $675  million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497024" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497024" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Arnold-Palmer-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="503" /> Arnold Palmer | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s all that iced tea and lemonade, isn’t it? Well, that and the endorsements from golf-appropriate sponsors Rolex and Ketel One, because Arnold Palmer is a badass. Obvious, there’s the Arizona Iced Tea collaboration, which debuted in 2000 and “was set to hit the $100 million mark in 2010,” <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/37132948" target="_blank">according to CNBC</a>. At the time, the Arnold Palmer represented 10% of the company’s business and 40% of its growth.

So for Palmer, who went pro in 1955 and, if you remember from the beginning of the list, was one of the instrumental initial signees of IMG along with Jack Nicklaus, things have been pretty gravy since then. The golfer’s business interests also expanded into, of course, a Golf Design Firm (Arnold Palmer Design) and his own tournament (the Arnold Palmer Invitational). The 84-year-old golfer continues to be involved with the golf community, kicking off the Masters Tournament every year since 2007.
<h2>1. Vince McMahon – $850 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497025" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497025" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Vince-McMahon-Ethan-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 10 Richest American Athletes" width="757" height="563" /> Vince McMahon | Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

While the merits of professional wrestling may be as sports entertainment, rather than a sporting event in the proper sense of the word, there is no denying that Vince McMahon, who started as a World Wrestling Federation announcer back in 1971 and bought the company from his father in the 1980s, has made an absolute killing with it.

McMahon did not actually wrestle until the mid-'90s when he became Mr. McMahon -- coincidentally, this was also when he was revealed to be the actual owner of the league, which would change its name to the WWE  (<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stock-research/company/?qs=NYSE" target="_blank">WWE:NYSE</a>), for World Wrestling Entertainment, in 2002.

McMahon, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fjlk45edee/vince-mcmahon/" target="_blank">highlighted by Forbes</a> as one of the most notable newly minted billionaires of 2014, has a pretty good head start on his athlete contemporaries. The 68-year-old has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update</span>: After losing $350 million in one day after the devaluation of WWE stock, McMahon is no longer a billionaire, and we have changed his value accordingly.

		<description><![CDATA[You might be surprised at how often team names get repeated and reused in America, but the patterns are pretty clear and very interesting.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_697715" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-697715 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lions-fan-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-IMages.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="391" /> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>There&#8217;s arguably nothing more important to a sports team than their name  &#8212; and not just because each team needs a label, but in the ontological sense as well. The team&#8217;s name determines who <em>they are</em>, and lays out signifiers about what the team is all about, which is why it is impossible to escape teams that take their identification from natural predators, impressive weather events, and other things which are, when actually viewed, awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Think about it; for the same reasons you might not want to attach yourself too hastily to a squad called the Millipedes or something (no offense to millipedes), fans are universally attracted to similar tropes and themes. And so the same names get reused over, and over, and over again. If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p>Here are the seven most common team names in the United States, ranging from high schools all the way to the professional ranks, <a href="http://mascotdb.com" target="_blank">courtesy of <em>MascotDB</em>.</a> See if you can spot any commonalities.</p>

<h4>7. Lions &#8212; 742 Teams</h4>
<p>Of these, the NFL&#8217;s Detroit Lions are probably the best known, but they&#8217;re just one hundredth of a percent of the Lions that have seen fields all across the country. What&#8217;s the appeal of a lion? In addition to the fact that they&#8217;re big, imposing animals (big cats are a big draw when it comes to sports teams), there&#8217;s also religious and political iconography to consider: Everyone wants to take a piece of the lion&#8217;s pie since they&#8217;re so darn majestic.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_697682" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-697682 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Warriors-Mascot-Hannah-Peters-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Hannah Peters/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>6. Warriors &#8212; 926 Teams</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re actually surprised that the &#8216;Warriors&#8217; team name grades out so low on this list, considering that the sports-to-war correlation has been drawn roughly 55 million times and counting. It&#8217;s worth pointing out that this is the first, and last, noun-as-concept to make an appearance on this list, since a &#8216;warrior&#8217; isn&#8217;t actually an animal or some kind of naturally occurring species. It&#8217;s a designation or an occupation. Slightly more difficult to define in the mind&#8217;s eye than a lion or a wildcat.</p>

<h4>5. Wildcats &#8212; 969 Teams</h4>
<p>Big cat? Check. Famous team? Check. The opportunity for some people to dress up as big cats in order to actively extoll the virtues of a franchise to throngs of the team&#8217;s supporters? Check, check, and check. While the most famous Wildcats are probably those based out of the University of Kentucky, the name has been used in women&#8217;s football, semipro basketball, and in high school sports programs around the country.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_697672" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-697672 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Carolina-Panthers-Cliff-McBride-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="435" /> Cliff McBride/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>4. Panthers &#8212; 1,124 Teams</h4>
<p>The second-to-last instance of a large, predatory cat on this list, the Panthers are both an NFL and an NHL team, plus over a thousand collegiate, semipro, and high school teams. We bet you&#8217;d forgotten about the Florida Panthers, too, even though they were in possession of the first pick of the 2014 NHL draft.</p>

<h4>3. Bulldogs &#8212; 1,136 Teams</h4>
<p>The only team name on this list that don&#8217;t have an analogous team in any of the U.S.&#8217;s four major team sports, although the NFL featured a team named the Boston Bulldogs for roughly 5 minutes &#8212; they only lasted for one season, in 1929, before folding. Under their prior name, the Pottsville Maroons, they were involved with the 1925 NFL championship scandal: disqualified from the league for playing an unsanctioned exhibition game. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061024153644/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=potts-25" target="_blank">Seriously</a>. Also the only canine in the top seven.</p>

<h4>2. Tigers &#8212; 1,354 Teams </h4>
<p>While the NFL team doesn&#8217;t count &#8212; even though &#8216;Bengals&#8217; is short for &#8216;Bengal Tigers&#8217; &#8212; the Tigers still have professional representation courtesy of the Detroit baseball team. What&#8217;s the takeaway? That Michigan loves professional teams named after big cats? Exactly. That is exactly correct and something the state shares with thousands of high schools and colleges across the country.</p>

<h4>1. Eagles &#8212; 1,603 Teams</h4>
<p>So why the Eagles? This one&#8217;s easy enough: As the country&#8217;s national symbol, and with the central narrative that sports play in the nation&#8217;s daily discourse, calling your team &#8216;The Eagles&#8217; is about as safe a choice as calling your team &#8216;The Team that is not bad and doesn&#8217;t bring to mind anything that is bad at all ever.&#8217; Only it&#8217;s shorter, and more visually striking. We imagine that, had the U.S.A.&#8217;s origin story gone differently, the Turkeys would be at the top of this list.</p>
