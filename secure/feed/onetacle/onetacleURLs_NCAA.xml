		<description><![CDATA[Which team will be this year's Cinderella during the March Madness tournament? Here's who we feel wore the slipper best in history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The greatest thing about the NCAA men’s basketball tournament: You never know when an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-vegas-is-now-picking-to-win-the-2017-ncaa-championship.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upset will occur</a>. And we've already witnessed a couple shocking twists this season.

Some of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-college-basketball-schools-in-the-country.html/">major programs</a> will fall, and some of the dark horses will make a run. In the end, this might be the only guarantee in a tournament with no guarantees, which is why there is nothing in sports like March Madness. With that in mind, let's revisit the nine greatest Cinderella stories in tournament history.
<h2>9. Syracuse Orange, 2016</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618502" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618502" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Syracuse-Orange-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Syracuse Orange celebrate a trip to the Final Four." width="757" height="505" /> Syracuse shocks the country. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 10
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: Final Four

Many folks believed Syracuse was undeserving of a berth in the 2016 tournament; that name recognition -- and not their resume -- was the only reason they received a bid that season. While critics might have had a valid argument prior to the start of the tournament, once the Orange took the floor at the Big Dance, the doubters were quickly put in their place.

The <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/syracuse/2016.html">10th-seeded Orange</a> proceeded to storm through the Midwest Region, defeating Dayton, Middle Tennessee, Gonzaga, and Virginia. In doing so, Syracuse punched an improbable ticket to the Final Four. Although Jim Boeheim's bunch fell to North Carolina in the national semifinal, one thing's for certain, the Orange's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-which-coaches-have-the-most-final-four-appearances.html/">legendary coach</a> clearly knows what he's doing.

<h2>8. Wichita State Shockers, 2013</h2>
[caption id="attachment_776475" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-776475" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Wichita-State-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Wichita State players celebrate a berth in the Final Four." width="757" height="511" /> No one saw Wichita State coming. | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 9
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: Final Four

Prior to becoming a regular fixture in the tournament, the Wichita State Shockers were just "some team" with a clever nickname. But that all changed in 2013, when a <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/wichita-state/2013.html">gritty No. 9 seed</a> went on one of the most unlikely runs in March Madness history.

Under the guidance of head coach Gregg Marshall, the Shockers exploded through the West Region. This group knocked out Pittsburgh, Gonzaga, and La Salle, before upending the No. 2-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes for a spot in the Final Four. Unfortunately for Wichita State, the clock struck midnight in the national semifinal, as the Shockers fell to eventual champion Louisville. Still, it's no wonder the university pays Marshall <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-basketball-coaches.html/">the big bucks</a>.

<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5">7. Davidson Wildcats, 2008</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_936855" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-936855" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Stephen-Curry.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Stephen Curry led Davidson to the Elite Eight. | <a href="https://youtu.be/aJBgFvbod2I">Youtube</a>[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 10
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: Elite Eight

People had heard whispers about Davidson's lights-out shooter Stephen Curry, but the 2008 NCAA tournament became his official introduction to the world. This kid <a href="https://youtu.be/aJBgFvbod2I">was totally unguardable</a>, as he helped the Wildcats defeat Gonzaga, Georgetown, and Wisconsin en route to the Elite Eight. They may have lost that contest to the eventual NCAA champion Kansas Jayhawks, but from that point on everyone knew Curry was a star.

<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5">6. Virginia Commonwealth Rams, 2011</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_936867" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-936867" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Virginia-Commonwealth-Rams-2011-NCAA-Basketball-1.jpg" alt="Head coach Shaka Smart of the Virginia Commonwealth Rams celebrates after defeating the Kansas Jayhawks." width="757" height="504" /> Head coach Shaka Smart of the Virginia Commonwealth Rams celebrates after defeating the Kansas Jayhawks. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 11
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: Final Four

The <a href="https://youtu.be/KNw3qYCgQDw">Virginia Commonwealth Rams had to win</a> the play-in game just to make it into the field of 64. No one had given them a second thought when they got a ticket to the dance, and then they started taking out big names like USC, Georgetown, Purdue, Florida State, and Kansas. You better believe that they put the entire field on notice after that. VCU lost to Butler in the Final Four, but they had made a statement in 2011. Shaka Smart and the Rams could play ball.

<h2>5. George Mason Patriots, 2006</h2>
[caption id="attachment_936865" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-936865" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/George-Mason-Patriots-2006-NCAA-Basketball.jpg" alt="Lamar Butler of the George Mason Patriots celebrates with Coach Jim Larranaga." width="757" height="482" /> Lamar Butler of the George Mason Patriots celebrates with Coach Jim Larranaga. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 11
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: Final Four

The George Mason Patriots, the lowly 11-seed, <a href="https://youtu.be/sT9U86K2Ugg">made it to the Final Four in 2006</a>. But they didn’t take the easy road to get there. The teams that stood in their path were merely some of the biggest names in the sport: Michigan State, North Carolina, and Connecticut. The Patriots toppled the big dogs and proved that, in 2006, the glass slipper fit.

<h2>4. Butler Bulldogs, 2010</h2>
[caption id="attachment_936866" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-936866" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Gordon-Hayward-Butler-Bulldogs-2010-NCAA-Basketball.jpg" alt="Gordon Hayward of the Butler Bulldogs reacts after beating the Michigan State Spartans during the National Semifinal game of the 2010 NCAA Basketball Championship.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 5
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: National Runner-up

The <a href="https://youtu.be/aBnOrAzQpNE">final shot of the 2010 National Championship game</a> may not have bounced Butler's way, but this small school from Indiana showed everyone that they could hang with the country’s powerhouses. In one tournament, the Bulldogs vanquished Syracuse, Kansas State, and Michigan State. Not bad for the modern day Hoosiers<em>.</em>

They enjoyed this fairytale run so much that they decided to do it again in 2011.

<h2>3. Kansas Jayhawks, 1988</h2>
[caption id="attachment_937023" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-937023" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kansas-Jayhawk-Danny-Manning.jpg" alt="Former University of Kansas Jayhawk Danny Manning stands in center court next to his framed #25 Jayhawk jersey during a Kansas game." width="757" height="1141" /> Former Jayhawk Danny Manning is celebrated during a University of Kansas game in honor of leading his 1988 team to a NCAA championship. | Earl Richardson/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: National Champion

The <a href="https://youtu.be/CZeiJLuf7W4">1988 Kansas Jayhawks</a> were not supposed to make a run in the NCAA tournament. After all, they had 11 losses on the year. But with Larry Brown calling the shots and Danny Manning playing out of this mind, “The Miracles," took home an unlikely national championship. This just goes to show that even the blue bloods are capable of wearing the Cinderella moniker.

<h2>2. North Carolina State Wolfpack, 1983</h2>
[caption id="attachment_936858" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-936858" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/North-Carolina-State-Wolfpack.jpg" alt="NC State celebrates winning the 1983 National Championship. " width="757" height="525" /> NC State celebrates winning the 1983 National Championship. | <a href="https://youtu.be/ICZ8HO8c9bw">Youtube</a>[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: National Champion

There are some moments that last a lifetime. The end of the 1983 National Championship game was one of them. When <a href="https://youtu.be/ICZ8HO8c9bw">NC State‘s Dereck Whittenburg</a> launched a prayer with time running out, it was clear that the shot was going to come up short. And then, Lorenzo Charles came out of nowhere to catch the ball in mid-air and slam it home before the clock struck “zero."

The place erupted, and State’s coach Jimmy Valvano started running around the court like a crazy person, just looking for someone to hug. It was one shining moment.

<h2>1. Villanova Wildcats, 1985</h2>
[caption id="attachment_936857" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-936857" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Villanova-Wildcats.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="551" /> The greatest upset in sports history at the hands of the Villanova Wildcats. | <a href="https://youtu.be/QGrzYe9qP7g">Youtube</a>[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Seed</span>: 8
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Finish</span>: National Champion

When the Villanova Wildcats <a href="https://youtu.be/QGrzYe9qP7g">defeated the Georgetown Hoyas</a> for the 1985 NCAA title, it was one of the greatest upsets in sports history. The eighth-seeded Wildcats were up against a giant in Patrick Ewing, and they needed to be flawless in order to pull this one off. Villanova wasn’t perfect. But by shooting 79% from the field, they were pretty much as close to perfect as you could get. And that’s how David defeated Goliath.

There is just something about March Madness. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-biggest-first-round-upsets-ever.html/" target="_blank">Major upsets</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/craziest-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/">Cinderella stories</a>, buzzer-beaters, and blowouts. The spread of talent in the NCAA Tournament is insanely large, with the top-seeded teams often blowing away the bottom-seeded teams by 30 or more points. But sometimes, things don't always go as planned.

Even when a team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-memorable-shots-in-march-madness-history.html/">takes a huge lead</a>, whether they're the favorite or the underdog, it's just not safe in the tournament. Throughout history, we've seen many teams storm back against all odds and take a game that appeared to be nearly impossible to win. Let’s take a look at some of the teams who were also able to rally in the NCAA tournament and pull off incredible comebacks.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Honorable mention: Vanderbilt 80, Pittsburgh 74</h2>
https://youtu.be/Hl3t7HLZMZ4

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 6 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 1988

We had to throw out an honorable mention, because this wasn't a comeback from a massive deficit. No. 7 seeded Vanderbilt took on No. 2 Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/1988-03-20-pittsburgh.html" target="_blank">in a second-round game</a>, and the two teams played each other tough. The game was tied at 34 at the half, and Pittsburgh was only able to pull away late. They took a 6-point lead with 12 seconds remaining, looking like a sure-bet to move on. But Vanderbilt guard Barry Goheen hit a three-pointer, after two free throws from Pitt, hit another three at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. Vanderbilt pulled away in the final minutes for an 80-74 win.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Honorable mention: Kansas 75, Memphis 68</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3sy0oHP3LI&amp;t

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 9 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2008

Another honorable mention has to go to the Kansas Jayhawks for their win in the title game over Memphis and star guard Derrick Rose. The Tigers <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2008-04-07-kansas.html" target="_blank">led the game</a>, 60-51, with under two minutes to play. But Rose and his teammates couldn't put the game away, even with an opportunity to do just that at the free throw line. Kansas was left with a three-point deficit and under 10 seconds left, and a three from Mario Chalmers tied the game. Memphis was stunned as the Jayhawks came away with a 75-68 win in OT.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Texas A&amp;M 98, Northern Iowa 88</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go_4eGCDF6Q

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 12 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2016

Again, not a huge deficit, but this is probably the greatest late-game comeback in the history of the NCAA Tournament--and maybe the sport of basketball. No. 3 seeded Texas A&amp;M was about to get knocked out in the second-round by No. 11 Northern Iowa, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2016-03-20-texas-am.html" target="_blank">trailing 69-57</a> with under 40 seconds remaining in the game. All NIU had to do was hold onto the ball and make free throws, and everything would be fine.

They couldn't. Northern Iowa just kept turning the ball over, and A&amp;M kept scoring. The score ended up tied at 71-71 at the end of regulation, and two overtime periods were needed before the game could be decided--with Texas A&amp;M coming away with a stunning 92-88 victory.

<h2>7. Illinois 90, Arizona 89</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmrvVQFGFlY

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 15 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2005

The University of Illinois Fighting Illini were the best team in college basketball in 2005. They started the season 29-0 and rolled into the tournament with just one loss to their record. Many had the Illini pegged to win the National Championship. And while they would eventually lose the championship to North Carolina, they had an even bigger scare in the Elite 8. No. 3 seeded Arizona <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2005-03-26-arizona.html" target="_blank">had the Illini down by 15 points</a> with just four minutes remaining in their game, and things looked bleak.

But that's when Deron Williams, Dee Brown, and Luther Head got hot for Illinois. They finished with a 20-5 run over the final four minutes, including three three-pointers from Williams--and the big one that tied the game. Illinois came out with a 90-89 victory in overtime, allowing them to move on to the Final Four.

<h2>6. Western Kentucky 59, Mississippi Valley State 58</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF2m0O0Z5So

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 16 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2012

There wasn't a ton of hope for Western Kentucky University to do much in the NCAA Tournament in 2012. They were 15-18 in the regular season and <a href="https://youtu.be/OF2m0O0Z5So" target="_blank">playing against Mississippi Valley State</a> for the right to lose to top-seeded Kentucky in the first-round. MSVU took a four-point lead at halftime and then eventually stretched it to 16 points, looking like the clear winner.

With just under five minutes to play, MSVU was up 53-37. WKU was just 2-for-16 from three-point range during the game, but got things done the hard way. Guard T.J. Price put in a layup for a three-point play to complete the comeback, giving WKU a 57-54 lead. They'd end up hanging on to win 59-58.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Ole Miss 94, BYU 90</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnvm-lKEMTI

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 17 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2015

Another pair of teams playing for the right to get into the first-round of the NCAA Tournament were Brigham Young and Ole Miss. <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2015-03-17-brigham-young.html" target="_blank">BYU took charge early</a>, holding a 17-point lead at halftime over Ole Miss. But M.J. Rhett brought his school all the way back, shooting 9-for-11 from the field and making some clutch baskets in the second half to give Ole Miss the lead with 7:41 remaining in the game. When you consider that they ended up winning the game by four points, it was a 21-point turnaround in this game. As Mississippi coach Andy Kennedy would say after the victory, “Welcome to March Madness!"

<h2>4. UCLA 73, Gonzaga 71</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt0VUSyVIr4

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 17 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament</span>: 2006

Not only did UCLA complete a major comeback <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2006-03-23-gonzaga.html" target="_blank">against Gonzaga</a> in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, they also gave fans an amazing finish. Jordan Farmar and Arron Afflalo lead a massive comeback that got the Bruins to within three points of the Zags at around 20 seconds remaining in the game. Adam Morrison missed a jumper for Gonzaga, and they made a big mistake in fouling on the rebound.

That sent forward Ryan Hollins to the line for UCLA, and he promptly made both free throws to pull within one point, 71-70. After the ball was in-bounded to Morrison, Gonzaga lost control and turned it over to the Bruins--who scored with under 10 seconds remaining to take a 72-71 lead. This one was an absolute stunner, as UCLA won the game 73-71.

<h2>3. Louisville 93, West Virginia 85</h2>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_kJouunDE

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 20 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2005

Louisville was a heavy favorite against West Virginia University in their <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2005-03-26-louisville.html" target="_blank">Elite 8 matchup in 2005</a>, which made it all the more shocking that WVU would build a 38-18 lead with just a couple of minutes remaining in the first half. Things were not going well for the Cardinals, who were looking like their season would come to an end. Larry O'Bannon and Taquan Dean led Louisville on a furious comeback, narrowing the game early in the second half. Dean, specifically, was huge in going 7-for-17 from three-point range during the game.

But even through the major comeback, they still found themselves trailing, 77-75, with just under a minute remaining. A driving basket by O'Bannon tied the game up at 77, sending it to overtime. He scored four points in the overtime period, ending up scoring 23 points in the second half and overtime after being held scoreless in the first half. Louisville pulled off the surprise comeback, winning 93-85.

<h2>2. Duke 95, Maryland 84</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJcbvh3rfMk"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 22 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2001

The Duke Blue Devils were dead in the water during the 2001 National semifinal against ACC-rival Maryland. The Terrapins had completely outplayed the No. 1 seed and built a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/01/sports/college-basketball-duke-in-final-after-another-comeback-jolts-maryland.html" target="_blank">lead as big 22 points</a> in the first half. When the teams broke for intermission, Duke found themselves in a 49-38 hole. But the second half was when the Blue Devils would rally.

Led by Shane Battier‘s game-high 25 points and Jay Williams‘s 22, the Blue Devils would flip the script on the Terrapins and outscore them 57-35 over the final 20 minutes. Despite a solid performance from Maryland star Juan Dixon, the Dukies proved to be too difficult to put down. This victory was Duke’s third win in their last four meetings with Maryland. The most memorable of the bunch came earlier in the year, when the Blue Devils would overcome a 12-point deficit in the final minute of the game. This would come to be known as the “<a href="http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205088638" target="_blank">Miracle Minute</a>."

This contest probably hurt the Terrapins more because it was for a berth in the 2001 National Championship game. The 95-84 victory in the Final Four, set the stage for Duke to face off against an extremely formidable Arizona team. In the end, it was all Duke, who would go on to cut down the nets after <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2001-04-02-arizona.html" target="_blank">defeating the Wildcats 82-72</a>.

<h2>1. BYU 78, Iona 72</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Deficit overcome</span>: 25 points

<span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA tournament</span>: 2012

In a weird twist of fate, it was actually the BYU Cougars who recorded the largest comeback in NCAA tournament history. The epic rally came during their First Four contest in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, against the high-scoring Iona Gaels.

Despite getting significantly dominated, including giving up 55 points in the first half, the Cougars <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=320730252" target="_blank">overcame a 25-point deficit</a> on their way to a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=320730252" target="_blank">78-72</a> victory. In a battle between two 14 seeds, it was BYU who exuded a remarkable amount of tenacity and grit. Behind Noah Hartsock‘s 23 points (16 of them coming after halftime), the Cougars outscored Iona 38-17 in the second half, on their way to the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuCSzCjQE3w" target="_blank"> greatest comeback in NCAA tournament history</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_702262" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-702262" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lane-Kiffin_Harry-How_Getty-Images-1024x810.jpg" alt="Harry How/Getty Images" width="800" height="633" /> Lane Kiffin is controversial | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

There may not be a tougher industry to succeed in than <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-coaches-who-couldnt-make-it-in-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank">coaching football at the sport’s highest levels</a>. For those who are lucky enough to land a high-profile job in the business, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-head-coaches-for-jacksonville-jaguars.html/" target="_blank">the pressure to win</a> is so intense that coaches in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> and in big-time college football are regularly fired after only one or two years on the job. Needless to say, it’s very rare to see multiple members of different generation from the same family achieve greatness as football coaches.

Over the last 50 years, the Kiffin name has become synonymous with coaching football. Monte, the patriarch of the Kiffin family and the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000645951/article/jaguars-hire-defensive-coaching-legend-monte-kiffin" target="_blank">architect of the Tampa 2 defensive scheme</a>, is one of the greatest coaches the NFL has ever seen. The 76-year-old built one of the best defenses in NFL history and is a shoe-in for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame whenever he decides to retire. On top of that, both of his sons have gone on to make names for themselves as coaches over the last decade.

Monte’s youngest son, Chris, is following in his father’s footsteps as a defensive coach, although he's earned notoriety for his <a href="http://247sports.com/Coach/Chris-Kiffin-1412" target="_blank">prowess on the recruiting trail</a> -- he is directly responsible for landing guys such as wide receiver Laquan Treadwell, defensive tackle Robert Nkembiche, and offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil, who all went on to be first-round NFL Draft picks, during his five years with the Ole Miss Rebels.

Monte’s older son, Lane, on the other hand, has an offensive mind and is one of the most controversial coaches in the sport.

At only 41 years old, Lane Kiffin has achieved more than most coaches will in their entire careers. He has previously held three extremely prestigious head coaching positions (Tennessee and USC at the college level, and with the Oakland Raiders in the NFL) and possibly the most high-profile NCAA assistant job in the country (offensive coordinator at Alabama); he has been a part of three national championship teams; and his offenses have produced three Heisman Trophy winners (Matt Leinart, Reggie Bush, and Derrick Henry).

With a resume like that, it would be easy to assume that Kiffin was well on his way to having his pick of the available college jobs across the country this year. But as it turned out, he was passed over by the likes of LSU, Oregon, Texas, Baylor, Houston, South Florida, and Cincinnati. Instead, he signed a five-year contract to be the next head coach at Florida Atlantic University, a little-known Conference USA program located in Boca Raton, Florida.

Given Kiffin’s prominence in the industry and his accomplishments over the last 15 years, we can’t help but scratch our heads and wonder why he settled for such a low-profile job.

Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="551" /> Lane Kiffin comes with some baggage | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The truth of the matter is that Kiffin really <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/117845/a-timeline-of-usc-turmoil-scandals-and-coaching-upheaval" target="_blank">only has himself to blame</a> for the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/why-isnt-lane-kiffin-getting-another-shot-as-a-head-coach-its-not-an-easy-answer/" target="_blank">dark side of his reputation</a>. His history of scandalous behavior -- he had a <a href="http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2008/09/30/al-davis-after-the-cameras-were-off-kiffin-conned-me-like-you-conned-all-you-people/" target="_blank">public feud</a> with the late Al Davis; he left Tennessee <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2012/11/16/tennessee-ncaa-added-penalties-lane-kiffin-willie-mack-garza/1709233/" target="_blank">after only one season</a> in which he committed numerous violations; he has been caught numerous times being less than honest; and he generally seems to take pleasure in calling out his peers -- is the likely culprit in Kiffin being passed over by multiple Power Five schools that were in the market for a new head coach over the last month. If he had a squeaky clean reputation off the field, we are confident that Kiffin likely would have landed either the Texas or LSU head-coaching gig, or possibly even another NFL job.

Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="543" /> Lane Kiffin has a lot of work to do at FAU | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

We fully understand that Kiffin has a burning desire to be a head coach. It has been just over three years since his last head-coaching job <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lane-kiffin-usc-airport-firing-was-the-lowest-point-in-my-career/" target="_blank">came crashing down</a>, and in reality, there isn’t a whole lot more that he can accomplish career-wise as an assistant coach.

We also understand the potential draws to FAU for the former Fresno State quarterback. He should be able to win games right way, he can essentially build the program in his image and put the Owls on the college football map, the campus is located in the heart of a recruiting hotbed (count on FAU instantly making an impact on the ultra-competitive recruiting trail), and he was able to hire his brother Chris as his defensive coordinator. More importantly, though, if things go well, Kiffin can prove that he has matured and is ready to lead a big-time Power Five program.

Regardless, this just wasn’t the right move for Kiffin at this point in time.

There is something special going on at Alabama. Ever since the Crimson Tide hired Nick Saban, they have been hands down the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-college-football-programs.html/" target="_blank">best program in all of college football</a>. And Kiffin was at the forefront of it all.

As the Tide’s offensive coordinator, he was in charge of one of the most powerful offenses the game has ever seen at the college level. He had NFL caliber talent at his disposal at literally every position on the field, and if things weren’t going their way on offense, Alabama always had a top-notch defense to pick up the slack (not to mention a defense that is also annually full of future NFL players).

All said, Kiffin was an integral part of a bona fide dynasty in Tuscaloosa, he was directly responsible for a budding star in quarterback Jalen Hurts, and had the added benefit of working under arguably the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-nick-saban-would-be-crazy-to-ever-leave-alabama.html/" target="_blank">greatest coach in college football history</a>.

We will give Kiffin credit for <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/kiffin-laughs-off-alabama-rumors-credits-saban-for-saving-career-as-he-starts-at-fau/" target="_blank">acknowledging the role that Saban played</a> in resurrecting his career. It was a definite sign of humility and maturity. However, on the flip side, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceFeldmanCFB/status/808692868747382784" target="_blank">said during his introductory press conference</a> that he “wanted to go somewhere they use the word ‘we’,” we instantly wondered if he had truly grown up during his time at Alabama. Granted, the statement could easily be taken out of context, but at the surface, it appears as though Kiffin was getting a jab in at the man who took a huge gamble on him three years ago.

Bottom line: Kiffin would have been wise to exercise some patience during this hiring process. Rather than take over a program that has made only two bowl game appearances since its inception in 2001, he would have been wise to stay with Alabama, likely win at least one more national championship, and then take a job at a school with the funding that would allow him to compete against the best programs in the country a year or two from now.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_586596" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-586596" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Heisman-Trophy-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Heisman Trophy is displayed." width="757" height="505" /> The best college football programs of all time have multiple Heisman Trophy winners. | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

College football is full of history and tradition. There are stadiums that are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-greatest-venues-in-america.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">practically national landmarks</a>, there are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-best-tailgates-in-the-country.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legendary tailgate parties</a> all across the country, and, of course, there are some of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-best-college-football-rivalries-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest rivalries</a> in all of sports.

Over the last 25 years, college football has turned into a billion dollar business. One aspect that remains steady, though, is the college football programs that have separated themselves from the rest of the pack over the course of time.

We put together a ranking of the 15 greatest college football programs of all time based on a wide variety of factors that include (but are not limited to) total wins, national championships, conference titles, and Heisman Trophy winners. We chose not to include the Ivy League schools that dominated in the late 1800s and early 1900s because they are no longer members of college football’s highest level. With that being said, here are the 12 greatest programs in college football history (in descending order).

<h2>15. Penn State</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Penn-StateHarry-HowGetty-Images.jpg" alt="The Penn State Nittany Lions had an outstanding season in 2016." width="758" height="504" /> Penn State is one of the winningest programs in college football history. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 845
<u>National championships</u>: 2
<u>Conference titles</u>: 5
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 1

While the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/shameful-teams-college-football-good.html/">disturbing scandal</a> that rocked college football undoubtedly tarnished Penn State's legacy in the eyes of most people, there is also no denying that the Nittany Lions are one of the best programs in college football history. They have a whopping 845 total wins, two national titles (1982 and 1986), five Big Ten titles, and they've had one Heisman Trophy winner (John Cappelletti).

After going through a down stretch in the years immediately following the aforementioned scandal, Penn State <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-football-coaches-2016.html/">reclaimed their place</a> among the best college football programs in the country with an outstanding season in 2016.

<h2>14. Auburn</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cam-NewtonChristian-PetersenGetty-Images.jpg" alt="Cam Newton speaks to the media during a press conference." width="757" height="507" /> Cam Newton carried Auburn to a national title. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 723
<u>National championships</u>: 2
<u>Conference titles</u>: 8
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 3

They haven't enjoyed the same amount of success as their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-college-football-rivalries.html/">bitter in-state rivals</a>, the Alabama Crimson Tide. However, there is simply no questioning the fact that Auburn is one of the greatest programs in college football history. The Tigers have won 723 totals games (13th most of all time); they have captured eight SEC titles (12 total conference titles including their time in the SIAA and Southern Conferences); they have won two national titles (1957 and 2010); and they have three <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/which-college-is-getting-the-most-value-for-its-nfl-talent.html/">Heisman Trophy winners</a> (Pat Sullivan, Bo Jackson, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-biggest-disappointmets-of-2016.html/">Cam Newton</a>).

Expectations continue to be sky-high for the Tigers. Their current head coach, Gus Malzahn, could start feeling the heat this fall if he doesn't put his team in position to contend for the 2017 SEC title.

<h2>13. Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_677821" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-677821" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Florida-Gators_Sam-Greenwood_Getty-Images-1024x728.jpg" alt="A Gators football player holds up his gloves, which have alligators on them." width="757" height="538" /> The Florida Gators have one of the greatest college football programs of all time. | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 674
<u>National championships</u>: 3
<u>Conference titles</u>: 9
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 3

Over the last 25 years, the Florida Gators have been one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/richest-athletic-departments-college-sports.html/">most dominant</a> college football programs in the country. During that stretch of time, they have posted 14 double-digit win seasons, won eight SEC titles and three national titles, and had two Heisman Trophy winners (quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-tim-tebow-is-trying-to-compare-himself-to.html/">Tim Tebow</a>).

The University of Florida football program has always been strong, but they truly became a national power in the mid-'90s when Steve Spurrier took over as the team’s head coach. They also later enjoyed an immense run of success under Urban Meyer. Despite a rough four-year run from 2011<span class="s1">–</span>14 under former head coach Will Muschamp, the future again looks bright in Gainesville, Florida with new head coach Jim McElwain leading the way.

<h2>12. LSU</h2>
[caption id="attachment_792782" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-792782" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LSU-FootballChris-GraythenGetty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="The LSU Tigers celebrate a victory in 2015." width="757" height="505" /> LSU is consistently one of the best teams in college football. | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 748
<u>National championships</u>: 3
<u>Conference titles</u>: 14
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 1

LSU is home to one of the most dominant programs in college football history. The Tigers have won 748 games, 14 conference titles, three national titles, and have had one Heisman Trophy winner (Billy Cannon). Their program consistently churns out elite NFL talent, and the Tigers' fanbase is easily one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-teams-fans-come-see.html/">most diehard fan groups</a> in the country. The 2017 season will mark the official start to the Ed Oregon-era in Baton Rouge. Longtime head coach Les Miles was sent packing during the 2016 season after just over 11 years on the job.

<h2>11. Georgia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_792799" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-792799" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Georgia-BulldogsMike-ZarrilliGetty-Images.jpg" alt="The Georgia Bulldogs mascots stands on the field during a game in 2016." width="757" height="542" /> The Georgia Bulldogs are almost always a contender in the SEC. | Mike Zarrilli/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 769
<u>National championships</u>: 2*
<u>Conference titles</u>: 14
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 2

It seems like the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/the-10-most-expensive-cities-to-be-a-college-football-fan.html/">Georgia Bulldogs</a> always find a way to win at least eight or nine games every season -- even during their down years. While it's been over a decade since they won their last SEC title, and even longer since they've made a serious run at a national title, this program is one of the greatest in college football history. The Bulldogs have 769 total wins (10th most all time), 14 conference titles (12 in the SEC), two national titles, and two Heisman Trophy winners (Frank Sinkwich and Herschel Walker).

<h2>10. Florida State</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jameis-Winston_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Florida State Seminoles hold up their fingers indicating that they're No. 1." width="757" height="511" /> The Florida State Seminoles football program is one of the best of all time. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 507*
<u>National championships</u>: 3
<u>Conference titles</u>: 15
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 3

The fact that the Florida State football program has had just two head coaches since 1974 should tell you everything you need to know about how successful the Seminoles have been throughout the years.

Former FSU head coach Bobby Bowden, who coached the Noles from 1976<span class="s1">–</span>2009, can be credited for the program’s rise to national prominence. Current head coach Jimbo Fisher has carried on the tradition of excellence in Tallahassee. On top of churning out countless All-Americans, Florida State has also become a haven <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/which-state-produced-the-most-2016-nfl-draft-picks.html/">for future NFL draft picks</a>.

<h2>9. Miami (FL)</h2>

<u>Total wins</u>: 564
<u>National championships</u>: 5
<u>Conference titles</u>: 9
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 2

In the early '80s, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-which-college-has-produced-the-most-hall-of-famers.html/">Miami Hurricanes</a> went from being one of the biggest laughingstocks in all of college football to one of the best programs in the history of the sport. In the process of becoming “The U,” Miami went on two dynasty-esque runs. The first was from 1983–1994 under head coaches Howard Schnellenberger, and the second came during the 2000–05 seasons with Butch Jones and Larry Coker at the helm. On top of it all, there may not be a better school in the country when it comes to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/colleges-produced-super-bowl-players.html/">producing NFL talent</a>.

<h2>8. Texas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_533635" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-533635 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Texas-Longhorns.jpg" alt="The Longhorns fly their flags." width="757" height="502" /> The Texas Longhorns are one of the most storied programs in college football history. | George Frey/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Total wins</u>: 840
<u>National championships</u>: 4
<u>Conference titles</u>: 30
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 2

No matter the level, football is king <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/top-10-retirement-cities-for-football-fans.html/">in Texas</a>. Knowing this, it should come as no surprise that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-head-coaches-in-texas-longhorns-history.html/">Texas Longhorns</a> are among the greatest college football programs of all time. Their dominance has been somewhat forgotten as of late given their recent struggles, but when it comes down to it, 835 wins, 53 bowl game appearances, 30 conference titles, and four national titles is nothing to scoff at.

Ever since Bob Devaney took over as their head coach in 1962, the University of Nebraska football team has been a force to be reckoned with. Devaney’s eventual replacement, Tom Osborne, was one of the greatest football coaches (at any level) in the history of the sport and the '99 College Football Hall of Fame inductee led the Huskers program to new heights.

From 1973–97, Nebraska had 15 10-win seasons, won three national titles, and had two Heisman Trophy winners. Perhaps the greatest indication of how great this program truly is, is the fact that anything <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-programs-college-football.html/">less than a 10-win season</a> typically results in their head coaches landing in the hot seat.

<u>Total wins</u>: 819
<u>National championships</u>: 7
<u>Conference titles</u>: 44
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 5

The Oklahoma Sooners are one of a handful of college football programs that have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-most-unbreakable-records-in-college-football-history.html">withstood the test of time</a>. They are the only program in major college football history to have four coaches each <a href="http://soonerstats.com/football/coaches/ou/index.cfm#.V6N7h2WBfwx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">win 100 or more games</a> during their time in Norman, Oklahoma.

Over the last decade they have won 10 or more games in a season eight times (they have also accomplished the feat 25 times in the last 50 years); they have had five Heisman Trophy winners; and they have won 808 total games, 44 conference titles, and seven national titles. With a loaded squad that includes a serious Heisman contender in quarterback Baker Mayfield, the Sooners will likely contend for their program’s eighth national championship in 2016.

<u>Total wins</u>: 778
<u>National championships</u>: 8
<u>Conference titles</u>: 36
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 7

Ohio State University is home to one of the greatest college football programs of all time. The Buckeyes have won eight national titles, 36 conference titles (34 came in the Big Ten), and 767 total games. Their seven Heisman Trophy winners ties them for the most by a single program in college football history. Few other schools can boast attendance figures that rival Ohio State’s. And Ohio Stadium (nicknamed “The Horseshoe”) is one of the most recognizable sporting venues in the country.

With head coach Urban Meyer at the helm, the Buckeyes are in the midst of yet another dominant run and should be among the top contenders to win the College Football Playoff National Championship Game in 2016.

<u>Total wins</u>: 909

<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 3

The University of Michigan is home to one of the proudest and tradition-rich college football programs in the country. The Wolverines have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-winningest-programs-in-college-football-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won more games than any other team</a> in the Football Bowl Subdivision; they almost always lead the nation in home game attendance figures; they have won a whopping 11 national titles and 42 conference titles; and they have 39 former coaches and players who have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Michigan is currently in the midst of a program revival under new head coach Jim Harbaugh, who has built the Wolverines into <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-national-championship-odds.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legitimate national title contenders</a> in just his second year on the job.

<h2>3. USC</h2>

<u>Total wins</u>: 739
<u>National championships</u>: 11
<u>Conference titles</u>: 37
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 7*

The USC Trojans have been a college football powerhouse since the early '20s. They have had three different head coaches win 100 or more games, and a fourth coach, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-head-coaches-in-nfl-history.html/">Pete Carroll</a>, won 97 games. During the Trojans’ run to 729 wins, 11 national titles, and 37 conference titles, they became known as “Tailback U” and served as the main football attraction in the major media market of Los Angeles from 1995–2016 while the city lacked an NFL team.

USC is currently fighting to get back into national title contention. With the type of talent they bring in on a yearly basis, it shouldn’t be long before we see the Trojans competing in the College Football Playoff.

<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 7

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-disappointing-college-football-teams-this-season.html/">Notre Dame Fighting Irish</a> have never been affiliated with a specific conference, but that hasn’t stopped them from becoming one of the most storied college football programs of all time. Everything <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ugliest-uniforms-college-football-history.html/">from their helmets</a>, to their stadium, to their never-ending list of All-Americans and College Football Hall of Famers, to “Touchdown Jesus” looking over their home field (see above photo) makes Notre Dame iconic. The Fighting Irish have won 815 total games, 11 national championships, and have had seven Heisman Trophy winners.

<h2>1. Alabama</h2>

<u>Total wins</u>: 892
<u>National championships</u>: 16*
<u>Conference titles</u>: 26
<u>Heisman Trophy winners</u>: 3

In our eyes, the University of Alabama is home to the greatest program in college football history. The Tide have had massively successful runs (including their ongoing dynasty) under arguably the two greatest coaches in college football history in Bear Bryant (1958–82) and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-nick-saban-would-be-crazy-to-ever-leave-alabama.html/">Nick Saban</a> (2007 to the present). They have won a record 16 national titles (some people will argue that it’s only 14, though), 25 conference titles, 878 total games, and have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-alabama-crimson-tide-players.html/">three Heisman Trophy winners</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Because some schools shine extra bright when March Madness roles around... Here's our take on the 15 best college basketball schools.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/">Cinderella stories</a>, Sweet 16s, and swarms of bracket-busting upsets. There is an undeniable amount of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-most-memorable-march-madness-shots.html/">surprise and excitement</a> that surrounds the NCAA <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/march-madness-2017-big-12-tournament-bracket-date-schedule-channel-live-stream/">men’s basketball tournament </a>every year. Of course, certain schools survive March Madness more often than others.

To bring you the most comprehensive list of top<span class="s1">-</span>tier basketball programs, we analyzed programs that have the most tournament bids, have made the <a href="http://www.worldlibrary.org/articles/ncaa_men's_division_i_final_four_appearances_by_school">most Final Four appearances</a>, and are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45efll/1-louisville-cardinals/#4acea27c7f79">top grossing</a> (Not to mention having the most consecutive success). Here are the 15 best college basketball schools across the country.
<h2><strong>15. Villanova</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_774195" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774195" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/villanova_josh_hart-1024x682.jpg" alt="Josh Hart of the Villanova Wildcats looks to repeat their NCAA Tournament success." width="757" height="504" /> Josh Hart of the Villanova Wildcats looks to repeat their NCAA Tournament success. | Mike Stobe/Getty Images[/caption]

Naturally, last year’s tournament champion was expected to put up a fight this March. But Villanova also has a rich history of tournament participation with 35 bids under their belt, tied for seventh-most in history. Their success in the NCAA tournament last year gives them more swag this time around, as they grind through the rest of the Big East competition. It’s no wonder the AP likes their chances going into the 2017 NCAA festivities -- and then broke everyone's brackets with a shocking loss to the Wisconsin Badgers.

<h2><strong>14. University of Wisconsin, Madison</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_774197" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774197" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wisconsin_kaminsky_dekker-1024x659.jpg" alt="The Badgers established dominance with Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky on the court." width="757" height="487" /> The Badgers established dominance with Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky on the court. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Even with the departure of Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky, and a tournament final loss to Duke two years back, the Badgers continue to put a strong product on the court. Whiskey is also one of the top valued teams in the NCAA, rounding out the top ten at a whopping $17.2 million.

<h2><strong>13. Oregon</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_774199" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774199" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Oregon_basketball-1024x674.jpg" alt="These Ducks are more than just a bunch of fancy flying neon-colored uniforms." width="757" height="498" /> These Ducks are more than just a bunch of fancy flying neon-colored uniforms. | Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

The Ducks are a kind of up-and-comer in the hoops world, and not just because they dress in highlighter yellow, which makes them impossible not to watch. The school known over the last several years for its football teams has an ever-evolving hoops squad that has made a lot of racket in the Pac-12 by adjusting to adversity as games progress. With a solid record this past season (27-4) and convincing play in the current conference tournament in Las Vegas, it makes sense that the AP has them ranked so high in their bracket projections.

<h2><strong>12. Gonzaga</strong></h2>

Spokane, Washington's finest are still sort of the new kid on the block, becoming a competitive threat on the NCAA tourney scene within the last couple of years. However, the Bulldogs have been WCC titans for some time, having won over 10 conference tournaments dating back to the mid-'90s. And since their Elite Eight bid in 2015, they have been a fore to be reckoned with in the month of March. Reigning head coach Mark Few and the Zags are considered a title contender for the 2017 tournament. After concluding a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/for-northwestern-blown-call-and-blown-gasket-put-the-mad-in-march-madness/2017/03/18/400faad6-0c12-11e7-b77c-0047d15a24e0_story.html?utm_term=.fe62bcd85fbf">heavily-debated and down-to-the-wire win </a>over favored Northwestern, there's no telling how far they might go.

<h2><strong>11. Syracuse</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_618502" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618502" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Syracuse-Orange-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Syracuse Orange celebrate a trip to the Final Four. " width="757" height="505" /> Syracuse Orange celebrate a trip to the Final Four. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

It's easy to forget with that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/syracuses-self-imposed-postseason-ban-is-pathetic.html/">self-imposed postseason ban</a> back in 2015. And considering the fact they quickly fell out of bracket projections following a conference loss to Miami before failing to make the NCAA tournament all together. But the Orange are March Madness regulars, having made 34 tournament bids and having a lone championship under their belt.

According to <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/jim-boeheim-1.html"><em>Sports Reference</em></a>, head coach Jim Boeheim and Syracuse have reached the 20-win mark 34 times through 36 of his seasons in charge. Unfortunately, Boeheim’s recent antics have cast a bit of a shadow. But it is unlikely that the tam will be down and out for long.

<h2><strong>10. Michigan State</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_593469" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-593469" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Denzel-Valentine-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images-1024x709.jpg" alt="Denzel Valentine takes a breather. " width="757" height="524" /> Denzel Valentine takes a breather. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Coach Tom Izzo, one of the Big Ten’s best, has built a winning program since arriving in East Lansing in 1995. The Spartans have a NCAA tournament streak spanning nearly two decades and won their second championship in 2000. Every year it seems like Michigan State climbs the NCAA’s ranks as the season progresses, and that’s the result of Izzo’s coaching ability and players wanting to play for him. It doesn’t hurt the Breslin Center is one of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-most-hostile-environments-in-college-basketball.html/">college basketball’s loudest venues</a>, either.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>9. UCLA</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_588525" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588525" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Collison-and-Westbrook-Jeff-Gross-Getty-Images-1024x685.jpg" alt="Throwback to Russell Westbrook's college days at UCLA. " width="757" height="506" /> Throwback to Russell Westbrook's college days at UCLA. | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

For starters, you can’t talk about this Pac-12 program without discussing Hall of Fame coach John Wooden. Wooden turned the Bruins into a college basketball dynasty second to none, winning <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/john-wooden-1.html">10 national championships</a> in a 12-year stretch between 1963 and 1975. Four times he recorded undefeated seasons — this has also never been matched.

While the Bruins haven’t had the same consistency or success since Wooden’s retirement, they have continued to churn out NBA talent like NBA All-Stars Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook. They made NCAA tournament headlines in 2015 when a missed goaltending call gave the Bruins the late win over SMU.

<h2><strong>8. Indiana</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_585000" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-585000" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/James-Blackmon-Jr.-Indiana-Hoosiers-640x423.jpg" alt="Hoosiers hoops has a heck of a history." width="757" height="490" /> Hoosiers hoops has a heck of a history. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Hoosier basketball is the end-all, be-all of the state of Indiana, and it has been for a long time. Which is beyond understandable, given their 39 tournament bids and eight Final Four appearances. Granted, Indiana took a nose dive following the 2000 season, when legendary coach Bobby Knight left under turmoil. (In his 30 years at the helm, Knight led the Hoosiers to an impressive three national championships.) Tom Crean took over in 2008 however, and brought the Hoosiers back to relevancy in the Big Ten.

<h2><strong>7. Arizona</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_774296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774296" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Zona_basketball-1024x682.jpg" alt="The Wildcats look to take their dominance from the Pac-12 to the NCAA tournament." width="757" height="504" /> The Wildcats look to take their dominance from the Pac-12 to the NCAA tournament. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Look at the Pac-12’s recent history, and the Arizona Wildcats’ prowess is a main fixture. The program has churned out some well-known talent like Sean Elliott and Damon Stoudamire (who is ranked third all-time at UA for assists and three-point shots). Granted, Arizona’s 2016-17 campaign was a bit rocky, with their four losses coming at the hands of stiff competition—Oregon, Butler, UCLA, and Gonzaga—but appear to be treating those losses more like stepping stones than failures. They currently sit with the AP’s top ten poll.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>6. UConn</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_619278" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-619278" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/UConn-Huskies-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="UConn Huskies celebrate winning the 2011 NCAA championship. " width="757" height="573" /> UConn Huskies celebrate winning the 2011 NCAA championship. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

With four national championships over the last two decades, (1999, 2004, 2011, and 2014) the Huskies are as relevant a team as they come. Whether it was coaching the likes of Ray Allen, Richard Hamilton, or Kemba Walker, former head coach Jim Calhoun used recruiting and good coaching to bolster the UConn program. They also have fan base that rivals many other in intensity — just look at <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/655332-uconn-basketball-video-watch-uconn-students-riot-fail-after-title-win">their celebration</a> following the 2011 national championship game.

<h2><strong>5. Louisville</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_738320" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-738320" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Rick-Pitino-1024x684.jpg" alt="Rick Pitino, the head coach of the Louisville Cardinals, looks on. " width="757" height="506" /> Rick Pitino, the head coach of the Louisville Cardinals, looks on. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cardinals won a national championship in 2013, ending a 26-year championship drought. Although, Louisville emerged as a threat before that, when current coach Rick Pitino took over in 2001 after a short NBA coaching stint. (Which of course caused quite a stir in a predominantly basketball state, since Pitino had previously coached at Kentucky.)

Though Pitino-led Louisville have only one championship and three Final Four appearances, they boast 10 Final Four appearances over their 41 tournament bids. They are also the highest valued team at $36.1 million.

<h2><strong>4. Kansas</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_764819" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-764819" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kansas-1024x683.jpg" alt="A fan of the Kansas Jayhawks shows support. " width="757" height="505" /> A fan of the Kansas Jayhawks shows support. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Kansas has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-highest-paid-coaches-in-college-basketball.html/">dominated the Big 12</a> for too many years to count. Head coach Bill Self has not once failed to take his team to the tournament, while also winning one of the team’s three championships in 2008. But the Jayhawks’ history goes a little deeper than the past few decades.

<a href="http://www.hoopszone.net/Kansas/Kansas/Coaches/history_of_kansas_coaches.htm">Kansas’s first coach</a>, in 1898, just happened to be the founding father of the game of basketball: Dr. James Naismith. While Naismith wasn’t very successful as a coach, he kick-started the sport we know and love today. It doesn’t hurt that Kansas has also been a very successful program, making 45 total tournament appearances and 14 Final Four appearances.

<h2><strong>3. UNC</strong></h2>

It’s hard to know where to start when describing the history and success that the Tar Heels have. You could start with the multiple championships under Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams, with the most recent coming in 2009. Or you could talk about the legends that have graced their court, like coach Dean Smith and Mr. Basketball himself, Michael Jordan. Or perhaps it is their 18 Final Four appearances that catches the attention.

And let’s not forget that their fan base at Chapel Hill is as devoted as any. As long as Williams keeps a solid track record for churning out winning teams, nothing will change anytime soon for the boys <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-most-memorable-moments-of-the-duke-north-carolina-rivalry.html/">in Carolina blue</a>.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-nba-players-who-were-kentucky-wildcats.html/">Wildcats</a> have one of the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-the-3-worst-injuries-in-tournament-history.html/">storied</a> programs in the history of the NCAA, and have all the accolades and stats to back it up. They’ve won eight titles, have appeared in the NCAA tournament all but twice since 1992, Kentucky also tops the list of most valued programs at $36.1 million. (Which is probably helped by the fact that they have the biggest <a href="http://www.rupparena.com/arena-information/history">college basketball venue</a> – Rupp Arena — of its kind.)

Kentucky has built up its current powerhouse identity thanks to John Calipari. The electric head coach has worked with some of the best recruiting classes in his eight years at the helm of this Kentucky program. Not only has the one-and-done culture changed the face of college basketball, but the program has also churned out more draftees than any other NCAA D1 hoops program.

<h2><strong>1. Duke</strong></h2>

Sure, Duke wasn’t a powerhouse before Mike Krzyzewski arrived in Durham to take over the Blue Devils in 1980. But it has been ever since. More than a few former and current National Basketball Association players have played for Coach K — Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, and Shane Battier, to name a few — and prospered under his tutelage. The Blue Devils last missed the NCAA tournament in 1995, which says enough about their dominance these past few decades.

Krzyzewski  became <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/us/sport-basketball-krzyzewski/">the winningest coach</a> in the history of men’s NCAA basketball in 2011 and has single-handedly made Duke one of the best teams every year. Whether it’s the five championships he has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-duke-basketball-stars-to-make-the-nba.html/">coached the Blue Devils</a> to (1991, 1992, 2001, 2010 and 2015) or Coach K’s ridiculous 12 Final Four appearances, he has become to college basketball what Bear Bryant was to college football.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_721006" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721006" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Alabama-Sean-M.-Haffey-Getty-Images-1024x766.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="566" /> Alabama is in the midst of a dynasty. | Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-college-football-programs.html/" target="_blank">Major college football</a> has been around for well over 100 years. Over that span, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-programs-college-football.html/?a=viewall">countless records be set</a>, and we’ve seen records fall on what seems like a weekly basis. In the history of college football, very few records have proven to be far enough out of reach to stand the test of time. After doing a little digging, we have come up with a list of 10 records that we have decisively deemed to be unbreakable. Here’s what we came up with.

<em>* Note: this list only considers Division-I/Football Bowl Subdivision records.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1.  Longest winning streak</h2>
[caption id="attachment_811234" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-811234 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Oklahoma-Sooners_Brett-Deering-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brett Deering/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Brett Deering/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  47</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  University of Oklahoma</li>
</ul>
This record will almost surely stand the test of time. The Sooners’ streak began in 1953, spanned the better part of five years, and included three perfect seasons. During the streak, head coach Bud Wilkinson led Oklahoma to recognized national titles in 1955 and 1956, and conference titles in all five seasons where the streak was alive. Since Oklahoma’s streak ended at the hands of Notre Dame in 1957, no other team in college football has had a winning streak longer than 35 games.
<h2> 2.  Most interceptions thrown (single game)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  9</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  John Reaves</li>
</ul>
What may be more shocking than Reaves throwing nine interceptions in a single game is the fact that the former Florida Gator went on to be a first round draft pick in the 1972 NFL Draft. Rease’s infamous performance came in a 38-12 loss to the Auburn Tigers, which ended up being Florida’s only loss during the 1969 season. Needless to say, we don’t see a quarterback approaching this dishonorable record anytime soon.

<h2>3.  Longest Punt</h2>
[caption id="attachment_811235" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/College-Football_Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-811235 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/College-Football_Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  99 yards</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  Pat Brady</li>
</ul>
This one really needs no explanation. Brady’s punt traveled the longest distance a punt can possibly travel, making this a record than can only be tied, not broken.

Likewise, the records for longest pass, longest run, and longest reception also stand at 99-yards, but we believe a 99-yard punt stands out above the rest.
<h2>4.  Most punts (single game)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  36</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  Charlie Calhoun</li>
</ul>
No, that’s not a typo. Charlie Calhoun of Texas Tech really did punt 36 times in a single game in 1939. At this point, you may be saying to yourself, “who cares about punting?" Well, we’re here to remind you that punters are people too.

<h2>5.  Rushing yards per game (single season)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q7S8wN_tL5Y?rel=0"></iframe>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  238.9</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  Barry Sanders</li>
</ul>
Sanders’ 1988 Heisman Trophy-winning season was, and still is, hands down the best season by a running back in college football history. What’s even more shocking is that Sanders’ 1988 stats came before the NCAA began counting bowl game stats in their official record book. In an 11-game season in 1988, Sanders averaged almost 240 yards per game. We simply don’t see a running back ever topping that mark.
<h2>6.  Most touchdown passes (single game)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  11</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  David Klingler</li>
</ul>
To put some perspective on this record, it would take some quarterbacks three or more games to throw 11 touchdown passes. Klingler set this record against Eastern Washington on November 7, 1990, and did so despite sitting out most of the fourth quarter in the 84-21 blowout win for the Houston Cougars. Even with the emergence of the spread offense in today’s game, this record will likely stand the test of time.

<h2>7.  Most touchdown passes (quarter)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_811215" align="aligncenter" width="632"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/David-Klingler_Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-811215 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/David-Klingler_Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="632" height="1024" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  6</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  David Klingler</li>
</ul>
This is another jaw-dropping record that Klingler (pictured above) will likely hold forever. During a game against Louisiana Tech on August 31, 1991, Klingler needed only one quarter – the second quarter to be exact – to throw six touchdown passes. Most teams struggle to get six possessions in a single quarter, and furthermore, the fact of the matter is six touchdowns for an entire game is a great day by any standard. There is very little chance we ever see another quarterback approach this record.
<h2>8.  Most touchdown receptions (single game)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  7</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  Rashaun Woods</li>
</ul>
Seven touchdown receptions in a single-season would be a great season for most wide receivers. Woods, playing for Oklahoma State, accomplished the feat in a single game against SMU on September 20, 2003. Again, we don’t see this record ever truly being in danger.

<h2>9.  Most yards of offense (single game)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_811238" align="aligncenter" width="666"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Andre-Ware_Joe-Patronite-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-811238 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Andre-Ware_Joe-Patronite-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joe Patronite/Getty Images" width="666" height="1024" /></a> Joe Patronite/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Record:  1,021 yards</li>
 	<li>Held By:  University of Houston</li>
</ul>
In a game against SMU on October 21, 1989 the Houston Cougars compiled 250 yards on the ground, and put up 771 yards through the air. This game really set the tone for Andre Ware’s (pictured above) run to the 1989 Heisman Trophy. Barring a high-flying game that features 10-plus overtimes, this record will never be broken.
<h2>10.  Most receptions (single season)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Record:</span>  155 yards</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Held By:</span>  Freddie Barnes</li>
</ul>
Even in today’s college football world where spread offenses have teams routinely throwing the ball 50-plus times a game, this record is safe. For Barnes’ record to ever truly be in danger, there would have to be a wide receiver who averages just over 11 catches per game over the course of a 14-game season, and that is unlikely to happen.

Celebrities are, almost by definition, likely to be familiar and recognizable to you. However, they don’t often appear on the cover of the "sports" page unless they are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/panthers-vs-broncos-7-celebrities-who-support-these-teams.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheering for their favorite sports teams</a>.

None of the following 16 celebrities are best known for their time on the college football field. However, they all had some sort of on-campus career on the gridiron before moving on to bigger, and arguably better, things. Here are 16 celebrities who played college football.

<h2>1. Dean Cain</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708475" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708475" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/101273865-640x426.jpg" alt="Dean Cain aka Superman smiles at the camera." width="757" height="499" /> Dean Cain was a Superman on the field | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Long before he was Superman, Dean Cain was a football star at Princeton University. Cain was <a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-athletesanotherlife/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a defensive back</a>. He set a national record <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/2010FCS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for interceptions</a> with 12 picks in 10 games (1987) and later signed with the Buffalo Bills. Unfortunately for the "Man of Steel," his career was ended by a knee injury.

Ultimately, Cosby <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/cosby_bill.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran track and played football</a> (fullback) for the Owls in the early '60s (after his time in the Navy).

Josh Duhamel is best known as the star of <em>Safe Haven </em>and the <em>Transformers</em> franchise. But he was also a <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/josh-duhamel/bio/190240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quarterback</a> at his hometown college, Minot State University, in North Dakota (where <a href="http://www.msubeavers.com/news/2011/9/3/FB_0903115212.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his father</a> also played). In addition to playing football, Duhamel told the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/josh-duhamel-plays-daily-news-sportswriter-rome-talks-real-article-1.458631" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Daily News</a> that he “also played college basketball for a year, but I figured I should probably go to class once in a while.” We think he made the right call.

The 38th president of the United States had his number retired at Michigan 20 years ago. Ford, a center, <a href="http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061209aaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lettered for the Wolverines</a> in 1932, 1933, and 1934. He was voted team MVP in the 1934 season. After his time in Ann Arbor, Mich., Ford chose law school at Yale over offers from pro football teams in the Midwest, such as the Lions and Packers. Still, he never strayed too far away from the football field; Ford served <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/ford_gerald.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as an assistant football coach</a> for Yale during his time there.

Before Matthew Fox became well-known for shows like <em>Party of Five</em> and <em>Lost</em>, he was a scholarship wide receiver <a href="http://www.tv.com/people/matthew-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the Columbia football team</a> in the mid-'80s. Fox played a lot, but he didn’t win a lot. During his time at the university, the Lions suffered a miserable <a href="http://www.gocolumbialions.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9600&amp;ATCLID=896903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">44-game losing streak</a>.

<em>NCIS</em> star Mark Harmon wasn’t just any college football player -- he was a really good one.

He was hardly the first gridiron star in his family, as his father, Tom, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/mark-harmon-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the Heisman Trophy</a> in 1940 at Michigan.

Before he was an actor, before he was a wrestler, before he was "The Rock," Dwayne Johnson was a football player at the University of Miami (Fla.).

For his career, Johnson had <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/15186/how-good-was-the-rock-at-football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just over four sacks</a> in four years, while playing alongside (or behind) future Pro Football Hall of Famer Warren Sapp.

<em>The Soup</em> and <em>Community</em>'s Joel McHale was part of the Washington Huskies' football program <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/trending/post/_/id/7271/how-good-was-he-joel-mchale-of-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from January 1992</a> to August 1993. McHale, a walk-on, was part of the scout team offense and never actually saw the field in a game for the defending national champs. As he wrote <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-walk-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Grantland</a> of his scout team days, “I made the defense look terrific.” McHale did get <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/joel-mchale-played-football-in-college-has-a-rose#1qn79k7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Rose Bowl ring</a> for his troubles, though.

Although Nick Nolte went to Arizona State <a href="http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-nick-nolte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a football scholarship</a>, things did not work out as planned. He would be expelled from the school <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/52916/Nick-Nolte/biography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for academic reasons</a>. He <a href="http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/03/nick-nolte-hollywood-interview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later played</a> at several junior colleges, including Eastern Arizona before becoming the famous actor we all know today.

Still, we'd say Morrison/Wayne ended up doing all right for himself in the long run.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_582668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582668" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Les-Miles-Brett-Carlsen-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="505" /> Les Miles was one of the highest-paid coaches in the country before he was fired | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the last twenty-five years, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-national-championship-odds.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big time college football</a> has turned into a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-valuable-conferences-in-college-sports.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">billion dollar industry</a>. Television contracts have grown exponentially, bowl game payouts continue to increase, and attendance figures remain massive all over the country. As a direct result, head coaches are now making more money than ever before.

Schools are now finding creative ways -- performance incentives, sponsorships, and in some cases, the use of private jets -- to compensate coaches. And the results are eye-opening.

<a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today recently released</a> their database of the salaries for every Football Bowl Subdivision head coach in the country (excluding private schools that do not publicly disclose financial information), and there are now 20 coaches (included Les Miles, who was fired by LSU early in the 2016 season) with annual salaries north of $4 million.

With that being said, here is a look at the 10 highest-paid college football coaches in the country.

<h2>10. James Franklin, Penn State <span class="s1">– </span>$4.5 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676135" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676135" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/James-Franklin_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="505" /> Penn State made James Franklin one of the highest-paid coaches in the country | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Penn State hired James Franklin away from Vanderbilt in 2014 after their former head coach, Bill O’Brien, left the college ranks behind to become the head coach of the Houston Texans. Judging by the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/james-franklin-getting-a-robust-six-year-deal-at-penn-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hefty contract he received</a>, the Penn State administration thinks extremely highly of Franklin’s abilities as a football coach.

In his two seasons of guiding the Nittany Lions, Franklin has posted a 25-14 overall record with two bowl game appearances, and recently notched his first signature win over the Ohio State Buckeyes. More importantly though, he has helped revive the program and started convincing big-time recruits that the future is bright in State College, Penn.

<h2>9. Hugh Freeze, Ole Miss <span class="s1">–</span> $4.704 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Hugh-Freeze_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="505" /> Ole Miss gave Hugh Freeze a contract extension following the 2015 season | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

When Hugh Freeze took over at Ole Miss in 2012, he inherited a program that was coming off of a disastrous 2-10 season in 2011. He was able to quickly turn things around in Oxford, Miss., going 7-6 in his first year on the job.

In the three seasons after that, he's led the Rebels to a 30-16 record. He has guided the program to bowl games in every year he has held the job, and he was rewarded with a <a href="http://www.redcuprebellion.com/2016/1/6/10726214/ole-miss-extends-hugh-freezes-contract-by-one-year-and-gives-him-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract extension</a> this January.

Looking forward, his program is facing potential NCAA sanctions following <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/sports/college/ole-miss/2016/04/28/laremy-tunsil-admits-taking-money-ole-miss-coaches/83683484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laramy Tunsil’s draft day</a> meltdown, and the Ole Miss athletic department can't be pleased with the Rebels' 5-7 record in 2016. Knowing this, Freeze may end up facing the chopping block at the end of the season.

<h2>8. Gus Malzahn, Auburn - $4.73 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_549681" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-549681 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gus-Malzahn_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="514" /> Gus Malzahn is one of the top offensive minds in the country | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Malzahn is in his fourth season on the job at Auburn. The 50-year-old coach has compiled an overall record of 35-17 with one trip to the now-defunct BCS National Championship Game and two other bowl game appearances during that time. Despite his success -- he had Auburn on track to reach a fourth bowl game in his fourth season running the program -- Malzahn is <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/auburnauthority/2016/09/18/13795-million-decision-potential-buyout-analysis-gus-malzahn-his-staff/90623234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently on the hot seat</a>.

<h2>7. Kevin Sumlin, Texas A&amp;M <span class="s1">–</span> $5 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kevin-Sumlin_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-1024x652.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="482" /> Kevin Sumlin has helped build Texas A&amp;M into a national powerhouse | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Texas A&amp;M hired Kevin Sumlin away from the University of Houston in 2012, and the 51-year-old coach instantly turned the Aggies into one of the most exciting teams in the country to watch. Under Sumlin, Texas A&amp;M has emerged as an offensive juggernaut and a place where NFL scouts go to find high-quality talent. He has the Aggies off to a fast start this year, and with the toughest portion of their schedule already in the rear-view mirror, Sumlin's team could ultimately end up winning 11 or 12 games in 2016.

<h2>6. Charlie Strong, Texas <span class="s1">–</span> $5.2 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_569586" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-569586" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Charlie-Strong_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-1024x594.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="439" /> Charlie Strong was well compensated, but it was clear he wasn'tbeing the long-term answer for Texas | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Texas hired Charlie Strong away from Louisville to take over for longtime head coach Mack Brown back in 2014. At the time of his hiring, Strong was one of the fastest rising coaches in the business, but his time in Austin didn't exactly gone as planned.

To be fair, Strong did go in and clean house during his first two seasons on the job. Nevertheless, his two-year record at Texas was 16-21 before he was fired at prior to the end of the season.

<h2>5. Jimbo Fisher, Florida State <span class="s1">– </span>$5.25 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676149" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676149" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jimbo-Fisher_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images-1024x721.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="533" /> Jimbo Fisher of Florida State is now one of the highest-paid college football coaches in the country | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Taking over for a legend is never an easy task, but Jimbo Fisher has made it look extremely simple. Since replacing Bobby Bowden in 2010, Fisher has led the Seminoles to a 77-17 overall record, three ACC titles, one national title, and one appearance in the College Football Playoff.

Knowing this, it should come as no surprise that the 50-year-old coach is among the highest-paid coaches in the country. His recently signed contract extension runs through the 2022 season and could be worth as much as $44 million in total, but that may not be enough to keep him out of the grasps of the LSU Tigers.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Bob Stoops, Oklahoma <span class="s1">–</span> $5.55 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676154" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676154" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bob-Stoops_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images-1-1024x685.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="506" /> Bob Stoops continues to be one of the highest-paid college football coaches in the country | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

Bob Stoops is the longest tenured head coaches in the Football Bowl Subdivision. In his 18 seasons on the job at Oklahoma, Stoops has put together a Hall of Fame-caliber career.

With a career record of 189-48, Stoops has led the Sooners to nine Big 12 championships and one national championship, won multiple Coach of the Year awards, coached two Heisman Trophy winners, and led his teams to bowl games in every season he has held the position. With a resume like that, it’s no wonder that Stoops is one of the most handsomely paid coaches in college football history.

<h2>3. Urban Meyer, Ohio State <span class="s1">– </span>$6.095 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_552532" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-552532 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Urban-Meyer_Justin-K.-Aller_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="542" /> Urban Meyer has been worth every penny of his contract with Ohio State | Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

Very few coaches have ever achieved the kind of success Urban Meyer has enjoyed over the course of his career. Every program he has been in charge of has reached new heights under his guidance, and he has proven to be one of the best in the business when it comes to developing NFL-caliber talent.

Since taking over at The Ohio State University in 2012, all Meyer has done is lead the Buckeyes to a 61-5 overall record, one national title, one Big Ten title, and three New Year’s Day bowl games. He is one of the highest-paid coaches in college football, and he has been worth every penny to Ohio State.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Nick Saban, Alabama <span class="s1">– </span>$6.94 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676163" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-676163" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Nick-Saban_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-2-1024x823.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="800" height="643" /> Nick Saban has earned the right to be called the highest-paid coach in college football | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The bottom line here is that Nick Saban is the gold standard in today’s college football coaching landscape. Back in 2007, he took over a dormant Alabama program and has since turned the Crimson Tide into a bona fide college football dynasty.

Saban’s program is currently on one of the greatest runs in college football history, posting a 118-19 overall record with four national titles, four SEC titles, and two Heisman Trophy winners in nine years. And they looked like the front-runners for the 2016 national championship as well. Needless to say, Alabama has seen and incredible return on their massive investment in Saban.

<h2>1. Jim Harbaugh, Michigan <span class="s1">–</span> $9.004 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672637" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672637" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jim-Harbaugh_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Who Are the Highest-Paid College Football Coaches in 2016?" width="757" height="505" /> Jim Harbaugh has returned Michigan to the national spotlight | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, Jim Harbaugh is unlike any other coach in college football. He has a huge personality, does things his own way, and demands excellence out of his players and his coaching staff. More notably, though, he is a flat-out winner. In just one year, Harbaugh has taken Michigan from being a mediocre team in the Big Ten to a legitimate national title contender and a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jim-harbaughs-recruiting-crazy-genius.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">force to be reckoned with</a> on the recruiting trail.

For Michigan, landing Harbuagh wasn’t cheap -- despite the fact that he played quarterback in Ann Arbor from 1983<span class="s1">–</span>86. But when it comes down to it, he has already proven to be well worth his enormous contract.

College basketball is littered with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-basketballs-10-best-programs.html/">historically great programs</a>. These clubs <span class="s1">-- </span>many are the "blue bloods" of college basketball <span class="s1">-- </span>tend to have a lot in common. They usually have fantastic coaches, recruit extremely well, and dominate on their home floor. These things, among others, are the keys to success in this particularly competitive world. Unfortunately, sometimes, they don't always work.

On January 18, back in the 2014 regular season, the Duke Blue Devils had just lost their <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400587917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second consecutive game</a>. While that was disturbing news for the talented <span class="s1">-- </span>albeit young <span class="s1">-- </span>team, the more pressing matter was that the Miami Hurricanes defeated them at Cameron Indoor Stadium. And Duke does not lose at home often.

At the time, the Duke Blue Devils had won <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/102180/duke-soul-searching-after-second-straight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41 straight contests</a> on their home floor. Usually the “Cameron Crazies" provide the ultimate home-court advantage. However, on that particular night, a rowdy and supportive crowd wasn't enough help their squad overcome unusually sloppy play.

In college basketball, home-court advantage is prevalent throughout the country. Of course, some teams benefit more than others. <a href="http://rpiratings.com/homecourtrec.php">Using numbers</a> running through the 2015–16 season, here's a look at 10 of the most difficult places to play college basketball.

It may not be known outside of college basketball communities, but the court at the University of New Mexico is one of the most intimidating in the country to play at. The venue, properly named “<a href="http://www.golobos.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209096628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WisePies Arena</a>" is and always will be known as "The Pit" to the Lobos faithful. With over 18,000 rowdy fans packed into this place, the Pit can be an opponent’s worst nightmare.

The state of Indiana is synonymous with basketball. Kids are pretty much born with a Spalding in their hands. And the school that these kids grow up idolizing is Indiana University. The dream? To become a Hoosier. That’s why <a href="http://www.iuhoosiers.com/facilities/ind-facilities-assembly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assembly Hall</a> is a scary place. Packed with extremely devoted fans in their red and whites, it doesn’t matter if the Hoosiers are competing for a national championship or not <span class="s1">-- </span>when they’re in this building, they always have a chance to win.

Tom Izzo is an intense head coach. His toughness is displayed through the Spartans of Michigan State. They dive for loose balls, body you the whole game, and play hard-nosed ball. When you step into the <a href="http://www.msuspartans.com/facilities/breslin-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breslin Center</a>, you can bet the fans will feed off this style. Often dressed in all white, the student body will spend the majority of the game on their feet, and they’ll make their presence felt. The harder the Spartans play, the more you’ll hear the support of their fans. In East Lansing, hard play is expected. Frankly, this is the only way they know how to do it.

Carrier Dome is a massive arena. At Syracuse University, athletes play both football and basketball here. But when push comes to shove, the Orange supporters love their basketball. To enter into Carrier Dome is to step into a sea of orange, and it is very threatening.

The arena may be big in size, but it somehow feels as if the fans are hovering just over your heads. It is a smothering environment and provides an enormous advantage for the home team. The ACC has always been one of the premier conferences in college basketball. Syracuse’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8170460/syracuse-orange-leave-big-east-year-early-july-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inclusion</a> has not made things any easier.

The Wisconsin Badgers are a good basketball program, known for being one of the most efficient and fundamentally sound squads in the country. But in the <a href="http://www.uwbadgers.com/facilities/kohl-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohl Center</a>, surrounded by a red wave of supporters, Wisconsin is nearly impossible to take down. Let’s just say that the two overhanging balconies in the Kohl Center present the type of home-court advantage that is just as effective as the Badgers brand of basketball.

The Kentucky Wildcats are college basketball royalty. And while there was a moment when the team was not a contender, John Calipari has since righted the ship. Recruits flock to Lexington in order to win titles, gain exposure, and prepare themselves to make the leap to the NBA. Oh, and they get to play in front of some of the most outrageously devoted fans in the country.

When <a href="http://www.rupparena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rupp Arena</a> is packed <span class="s1">--</span> and believe us, it tends to be that way often <span class="s1">--</span> not only do opposing teams need to deal with the pressure and tenacity of a top-tier Kentucky team, but they need to overcome the noise of the home crowd as well. How are you supposed to beat one of the best teams in the country in front of arguably the best fans on the planet? Simple: You’re not.

The inventor of basketball, <a href="http://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/james-naismith/12154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Naismith</a>, coached in Lawrence, Kan. If you knew nothing else, that would be enough to understand what basketball means to the Kansas Jayhawks and their fans. The Jayhawks are one of the blue bloods of the sport, and when the faithful pack into <a href="http://www.kuathletics.com/sports/2013/6/27/GEN_0627134307.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allen Fieldhouse</a>, there is rarely a better place to watch a game than in Kansas.

The home team is afforded the benefits of the unwavering support of the crowd, who have sold out the Allen Fieldhouse in more than <a href="http://www.iowastatedaily.com/sports/mens_basketball/article_b3fe2a30-87ae-11e3-9849-001a4bcf887a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200 consecutive contests.</a> That’s good news for the Jayhawks, and bad news for everyone else.

Pittsburgh doesn't always receive enough praise for its basketball program, but the same cannot be said for the home-court advantage at Petersen Events Center. At this venue, opponents are forced to endure the wrath of a relentless student section, dubbed the "Oakland Zoo." With that kind of support behind them, the Panthers know that, at Petersen Events center, they are never out of the fight.

Year after year, Xavier puts a quality product out on the floor. While the Musketeers battle -- and often defeat -- many of the country's other top programs, they know their fans at the Cintas Center are always in their corner. After all, when you're blessed to have over 10,000 supporters jumping up and down, painting their faces, and going absolutely wild, it's almost impossible not to get amped up playing at home.

The Gonzaga Bulldogs are one of the best programs in the country. Under head coach Mark Few, the Zags constantly win conference titles, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/gonzaga/">make the tournament on the regular</a>, and rank among the top 10 teams in college basketball on a consistent basis.

When they play at home, in front of the 6,000 strong -- that's all they need for an advantage -- at McCarthey Athletic Center, losing is pretty much the last thing on anyone's mind. If a team hopes to beat the Bulldogs on their home floor, then they better play a perfect game. Otherwise, they're simply wasting their time.

		<description><![CDATA[What separates NCAA football from pro football: the heated rivalries. Here are the 6 biggest rivalries in college football.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_694769" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-694769" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/454408066.jpg" alt="College Football's 6 Biggest Rivalries of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> The Oregon Ducks' Autzen Stadium | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

What makes college football so exciting isn’t just that the players and fans alike have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/richest-athletic-departments-college-sports.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep ties to their respective schools</a>. No, it’s more than that. It’s a pride that ebbs from the people who came before you and the people who will come after you.

Cliché or not, that’s what really separates NCAA football from professional football for the most dedicated collegiate football fan — a belief that, beyond debating whether the players-should-be-paid or the ethics of schools making millions from athletes who get nothing, at its core college football is a pure game.

Part of this purity also stems from the heated rivalries that help fuel the intensity. The players know it and the fans live for it. Sure, some fan bases are a little more vicious than others (take Michigan-Ohio State, where wearing maize and blue in Columbus almost guarantees some sort of altercation), but it’s all part of the fun.

College football has been played for well over a century, and that’s why the rivalries—many of them having some sort of trophy that’s passed back and forth to the victors—will never die. The best match-ups are always must-watch TV. Here are the six best rivalries in college football.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Michigan vs. Ohio State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_825181" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-825181 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jim-Harbaugh-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-e1436991776940.jpg" alt="College Football's 6 Biggest Rivalries of All Time" width="757" height="607" /> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

As already referenced, this is one of the best rivalries in all of college football—yes, even despite Michigan’s lack of recent relevance. Going back to the days of Woody Hayes and Bo Schembechler, the rivalry was always one of the most fun and competitive in the country.

Every season it seemed like the “that team up north" and “Ohio" were going head-to-head for the Big Ten title, and in doing so, some historic games occurred. The rivalry clearly got a boost when Ohio State hired Urban Meyer in 2011. Even more so a year ago when the Buckeyes brought home a national title; one that the Big Ten desperately needed to remain on the national scene.

When you add Ohio State’s relevance and string of success with the hiring of Jim Harbaugh in Ann Arbor, it would appear—at least the fans are hoping—a revival has occurred.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Alabama vs. Auburn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719381" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719381" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/452653663-e1414777927562.jpg" alt="College Football's 6 Biggest Rivalries of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Kevin C.

Known as the Iron Bowl, this bout between SEC powerhouses is one of the most competitive games every season. This is compounded by the fact that the schools aren’t just inter-conference rivals, but also intra-state rivals.

Traditionally, at least since the BCS system’s implementation and now the College Football Playoff, the Iron Bowl has various National Title implications. When the game comes along, usually Alabama, Auburn or both are contending for the nation’s top spot. Despite the all-time match-ups that have occurred over the years between the two SEC perennial powerhouses, 2013 saw one of the most exciting games in a long time.

Alabama entered the game undefeated and well on its way to a National Championship berth. And with one second remaining and the score tied, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/30/auburn-return-alabama-field-goal-attempt_n_4365811.html%20">Crimson Tide attempted a game-winning field goal</a>. It ended up being game-winning, just not for Alabama, as Auburn caught the kick and returned it for a touchdown. They wound up taking a National Championship that year, too.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Notre Dame vs. USC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_829344" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829344 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Notre-Dame-vs.-USC-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="College Football's 6 Biggest Rivalries of All Time" width="757" height="555" /> George Farmer of the USC Trojans runs for a touchdown after his catch in front of Cole Luke of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the only rivalries on this list that doesn’t include teams from the same conference, this rivalry dates back to 1900. Whether in South Bend or Los Angeles, the game has seen various Hall-of-Fame coaches and Heisman hopefuls, and with that has come a modicum of success. Despite the Fighting Irish canceling their rivalry game with the University of Michigan two years ago, it seems likely that the Notre Dame-Trojan rivalry will continue for many years to come.

<h2>4. Oklahoma vs. Texas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708229" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708229" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Longhorns-Sooners-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="DALLAS, TX - OCTOBER 10: Marcus Johnson #7 of the Texas Longhorns scores a touchdown against Ahmad Thomas #13 of the Oklahoma Sooners in the first quarter during the AT&amp;T Red River Showdown at the Cotton Bowl on October 10, 2015 in Dallas, Texas.

One of the long-standing rivalries in the Big 12—despite the conference just avoiding a massive, potentially crumbling realignment—the Sooners and the Longhorns have an intricate past. Texas currently leads the series 61-44-5, but even more impressively, the game occurs in the famous Cotton Bowl right in the middle of the Texas State Fair.

While the two states share a physical border, the game itself has its own border war in that the 50-yard line splits the raucous fan bases right down the middle. Though the Big 12 has had a recent resurgence—looking at the Baylor’s and TCU’s of the conference and their rise to the top—Texas and Oklahoma are always in the thick of things, thus making this game exciting each and every year.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. California vs. Stanford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_807096" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-807096 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Stanford_Orange-Bowl-e1433007449682.jpg" alt="College Football's 6 Biggest Rivalries of All Time" width="757" height="516" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

The oldest rivalry on the West Coast, these two teams fight it out every year in the Bay Area. Not only has the Cardinal dominated the series of late, but it also holds a 60-46-11 record. However, the rivalry is most famous for what has been titled “<a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/10/18/30-years-later-the-play-remembered/">the play.</a>”

As Cal attempted to lateral its way down the field in the game’s final seconds, the Stanford band rushed the field. Now famous for the classic “the band is on the field” announcer quote, that moment as Cal players stumbled upon Stanford’s band will always be one the classic moments of college football. Either way, the two prestigious schools have made a classic rivalry on the field, too.

<h2>6. Army vs. Navy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708231" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708231" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Navy-Football-Saul-Loeb-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Members of the Navy football team run out onto the field prior to the Army vs. Navy football game attended by US President George W.

Going back to 1890, this rivalry matches the nation’s military academies against each other. Every year in the final week of the regular season, the two schools battle each other—quite the battle it is—for the ultimate bragging rights. The winner receives the Commander-in-Chief’s trophy, and as a whole, the Midshipmen have the edge holding a 59-49-7 record against the Black Knights.

Despite the close overall record, the contest hasn’t been as even recently: Navy has won 13 straight. It’s more than just a football game, though. The prestige of the two academies coupled with the long-standing rivalry between the schools makes this one of the most watched games every year.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[While many talented football players have come through the University of Michigan, here's a look at the 5 best Michigan Wolverines of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_903864" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-903864" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Michigan-Wolverines-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best Michigan Wolverines of All Time" width="757" height="506" /> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Although the 2015 Michigan Wolverines did not finish atop the Big Ten standing and will not compete in the College Football Playoff, this year’s group did something special for a program that struggled to regain its standing among the elite teams in college football: It made Michigan football relevant again.

In his first season since returning to his alma mater, not only did head coach Jim Harbaugh lead the Wolverines to a 9-3 regular-season record (6-2 in conference play), he also brought a toughness and swagger that had not existed in Ann Arbor over the past couple of seasons. Despite the program’s rich history and laundry list of accomplishments, Michigan football had lost its luster. But rest assured, Wolverines fans. That spark is back. And it’s not going anywhere.

Considering what Harbaugh accomplished with this season’s team, we can only imagine the success that will follow once his recruits make their way onto campus. Of course, before Michigan fans get too excited about the bright future of this program, it never hurts to pay tribute to the past players who helped make this team what it is today. Here’s a look at the five best Michigan Wolverines of all time.

<h2>5. Braylon Edwards</h2>
[caption id="attachment_903665" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-903665" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Braylon-Edwards-Donald-Miralle-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best Michigan Wolverines of All Time" width="757" height="539" /> Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

Suiting up for Michigan from 2001-04, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/EdwaBr00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braylon Edwards</a> became one of the most decorated wide receivers to ever don a Wolverines uniform. By the time his college career concluded, Edwards had 252 receptions (fifth in Big Ten history), 3,541 receiving yards (fifth in Big Ten history), and 39 receiving touchdowns (first in Big Ten history). On top of that, during the 2004 season, Edwards was named a Consensus All-American, earned Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors, and won the <a href="http://biletnikoffaward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biletnikoff Award</a> as the nation’s most outstanding receiver.

<h2>4. Tom Harmon</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwd_UX4OFXc"></iframe>

Prior to being selected first overall by the Chicago Bears in the 1941 NFL draft, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarmTo20.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Harmon</a> was dominating the world of college football. During his three years at Michigan (1938-40), Old 98 proved to be such a force at both running back and quarterback that he was named a Consensus All-American in his final two seasons at the university, while also taking home both the Heisman Trophy and Maxwell Award in 1940. He ended his college career with such a bang that even the Ohio State faithful <a href="http://blogpublic.lib.msu.edu/index.php/november-23-1940-university-of?blog=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn’t help but cheer for him</a>.

From 1979-82, wide receiver <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CartAn00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Carter</a> gave Michigan one of the most lethal receiving threats in all of college football. Aside from finishing his career with the second most receiving touchdowns in Big Ten history (37), Carter would also become one of the only <a href="http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051800aaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-time All-Americans</a> in Wolverines history. It’s safe to say that he set the standard by which all Michigan wideouts were measured.

<h2>2. Desmond Howard</h2>

While <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HowaDe00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Desmond Howard</a> decimated the competition during much of his three years with the maize and blue, his play during the ’91 season elevated him to an entirely different level of greatness. During that season, his last at Michigan, Howard finished with 1,165 yards from scrimmage, while leading the Big Ten in receiving yards (985) and the NCAA in receiving touchdowns (19). For his sensational work, Howard earned Consensus All-American honors, was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, and won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, and the Heisman Trophy.

<h2>1. Charles Woodson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_903689" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-903689" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Charles-Woodson-Tom-Hauck-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best Michigan Wolverines of All Time" width="757" height="506" /> Tom Hauck/Getty Images[/caption]

Many great football players have passed through the University of Michigan, but <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodCh00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Woodson</a> stands out among the rest. While Woodson was always making things happen on the offensive side of the ball, it was his superior play at the cornerback position that continuously turned heads. Which is why, in 1997, aside from winning a handful of individual honors, Woodson became the first and only primarily defensive player <a href="http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap3000000500887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to win the Heisman Trophy</a> in college football history.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_774719" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774719" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Villanova-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Villanova players hoist the title." width="757" height="505" /> Who's cutting down the nets this season? | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The 2017 NCAA tournament is well underway, and it's been nothing short of madness. The upsets have been plentiful, the heroes have found their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ncaa/the-7-most-memorable-march-madness-shots.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">moments to shine</a>, and even some <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/">Cinderellas have managed to dance</a> their way into our hearts. So far, this year's tourney has been everything we could've hope for. And lucky for us, there's still more to come.

Now that the field has been dwindled down significantly, the oddsmakers in Vegas have already started to rethink their previous assessment. Here are the teams with the best odds of cutting down the nets at the 2017 NCAA tournament.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. (tie) Michigan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_778454" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-778454" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Michigan-Wolverines-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michigan's Zak Irvin #21 pumps his fist." width="757" height="505" /> The Michigan Wolverines are just so hot right now. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +1600

The Michigan Wolverines entered the tournament as one of the hottest teams in the country. They won their last five games of the season <span class="s1">-- </span>four of which occurred in the conference tourney and resulted in an unlikely Big Ten tournament title <span class="s1">-- </span>and were <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/michigan/2017-schedule.html">rewarded the No. 7 seed in the Midwest Region</a>. And not even the bright lights of the Big Dance have been able to slow this group down.

John Beilein's Wolverines held off a valiant Oklahoma State team in the first round, and followed up that win with a stunning victory over the No. 2-seeded Louisville Cardinals in the second round. Next up, is a date in the Sweet 16 with an athletic Oregon Ducks squad. With the way Michigan has handled its business lately, a spot in the Elite Eight is not out of the question.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. (tie) Baylor</h2>
[caption id="attachment_778438" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-778438" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Baylor-Bears-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="King McClure #22 of the Baylor Bears celebrates with his teammates." width="757" height="505" /> Don't overlook the Baylor Bears. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +1600

After finishing the year as the No. 12-ranked team in the AP poll, the Baylor Bears earned the No. 3 seed in a loaded East Region. And while the top two teams -- Villanova and Duke -- in that part of the bracket have been eliminated, the Bears continue to chug along; the dream of a national championship still in sight.

Baylor knocked out No. 14 New Mexico State in the first round, and dispatched a feisty USC squad in the second round. If the Bears are able to overcome a confident South Carolina team in the Sweet 16, they'll be one step closer to punching a ticket in the Final Four. Of course, taking down the Gamecocks has proven to be easier said than done. Just ask the Blue Devils.

<h2>7. Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_778422" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-778422" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Florida-Gators-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Justin Leon #23 of the Florida Gators celebrates drawing a foul." width="757" height="525" /> The Florida Gators are chomping at the bits. | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +1200

Despite coming into the tournament on a two-game losing streak, the Florida Gators <span class="s1">-- </span>who finished the season as the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/florida/2017-schedule.html">No. 20-ranked team in the final AP poll</a> <span class="s1">--</span> have found their groove on the biggest stage. The East Region's No. 4 seed defeated East Tennessee State in the first round, and then quickly proceeded to blow out Virginia in the second round by the score of 65-39. It'll be interesting to see what Florida can do against a super disciplined Wisconsin team in their upcoming Sweet 16 showdown.

<h2>6. Kentucky</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774744" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774744" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Malik-Monk-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-640x440.jpg" alt="Malik Monk and Bam Adebayo of the Kentucky Wildcats celebrate." width="757" height="520" /> Malik Monk has Kentucky ready to dance. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +1000

The Kentucky Wildcats aren't perfect, but they're definitely legit. Behind gifted freshman scorer, Malik Monk, the Cats put up over 85 points per game, won both the SEC regular season and tournament crowns, and finished the year as the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/kentucky/2017-schedule.html">No. 5 team in the AP poll</a>. That success has carried over to the Big Dance.

As the No. 2 seed in the South Region, Kentucky defeated Northern Kentucky and Wichita State in its first two games of the tournament. Next up is a much-anticipated matchup with the third-seeded UCLA Bruins in the Sweet 16. If you thought the Wildcats were confident now, just imagine how they'll feel if they knock off Westwood's finest. Time for head coach John Calipari to earn <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-basketball-coaches.html/">that paycheck</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. UCLA</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774759" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774759" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lonzo-Ball-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Lonzo Balls brings up the rock." width="757" height="505" /> UCLA will only go as far as Lonzo Ball can take them. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +900

UCLA started off the year as the No. 16-ranked team in the country. Then freshman sensation Lonzo Ball broke onto the scene, taking control of the offense and and turning the Bruins into one of the most exciting squads in the nation.

With the 6-foot-6 freshman pushing the tempo, UCLA <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/ucla/2017.html">led the nation in scoring</a> at over 90 points per game, finished with best offensive rating in college basketball, and earned a No. 3 seed in the South Region. Since the tournament began, the Bruins have continued to impose their will on the opposition, handily defeating both Kent State and Cincinnati. We expect that the Kentucky Wildcats will give them a run for their Sweet 16. However, if Ball brings his A-game, it's hard not to like the Bruins' chances.

<h2>3. (tie) Gonzaga</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774752" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774752" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gonzaga-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-640x463.jpg" alt="The Gonzaga Bulldogs celebrate a victory." width="757" height="547" /> Don't overlook the Zags. | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +650

The Gonzaga Bulldogs never seem to get the respect they deserve. Sure, they finished the regular season as the No. 2 team in the nation and earned the No. 1 seed in the West Region, but most fans still seem to have a hard time picturing the Zags as the last team standing. This isn't a problem for coach Mark Few and the Bulldogs <span class="s1">-- </span>they're quite used to playing the role of the underdog. Feel free to doubt Gonzaga if you dare; just don't come crying to us when this squad winds up dancing its way to a confetti shower.

<h2>3. (tie) Arizona</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774776" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774776" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Arizona-Wildcats-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Lauri Markkanen #10 of the Arizona Wildcats reacts after hitting a triple." width="757" height="505" /> Arizona is no joke. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +650

The Arizona Wildcats are peaking at just the right time. Following a Pac-12 tournament title, the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/arizona/2017-schedule.html">No. 4 team in the country</a> entered the Dance on a four-game winning streak. And while they were forced to settle for the No. 2 seed in the West Region, Sean Miller and company have done nothing but take care of business, defeating both North Dakota State and Saint Mary's (CA). Although Xavier is expected to give them a run for their money in the Sweet 16, it's hard to imagine the Wildcats not advancing.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. North Carolina</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774726" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774726" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/North-Carolina-Tar-Heels-Grant-Halverson-Getty-Images-e1489409494444.jpg" alt="The Tar Heels cheer on their teammates." width="757" height="611" /> North Carolina is tourney ready. | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +500

The North Carolina Tar Heels lost in heartbreaking fashion in last year's national championship game. In 2017, Roy Williams and company are poised to rebound in a major way. After winning their second straight ACC regular-season crown, the South Region's No. 1 seed has continued to live up to the hype, dispatching both Texas South and Arkansas in the first and second rounds, respectively.

The Butler Bulldogs, whom North Carolina will face in the Sweet 16, are most certainly a formidable opponent. Yet, we like Roy Williams' chances of adding to his already impressive <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-coaches-with-the-most-ncaa-tournament-wins.html/">tournament haul</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Kansas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774740" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774740" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kansas-Jayhawks-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Frank Mason III #0 of the Kansas Jayhawks pumps up the crowd." width="757" height="549" /> The Kansas Jayhawks are legit. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +475

Although they floundered in their conference tournament, the Kansas Jayhawks <span class="s1">-- </span>who were awarded the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region <span class="s1">-- </span>are still among the most complete teams in the country. After winning the Big 12 regular-season title for the 13th consecutive season, Bill Self's group entered the tournament ranked No. 3 in the final AP poll and has quickly asserted its dominance over the rest of the field. At this moment, the Jayhawks appear to be the team to beat. No pressure.

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-most-hostile-environments-in-college-basketball.html/" target="_blank">College basketball</a> is home to some of the greatest, longest tenured coaches <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-football-coaches-2016.html/" target="_blank">in all of sports</a>. Tenure is something that coaches earn through on-court success, and with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-highest-paid-coaches-in-college-basketball.html/" target="_blank">coaching tenure comes program stability</a>.

Duke men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski has held the Blue Devils’ job since the 1980<span class="s1">–</span>81 season. He is the only coach that the NCAA recognizes (we'll explain that statement later) as a member <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-basketballs-10-best-programs.html/">of the 1,000-win club</a>.

Coach K has held the all-time wins record for a men’s college basketball coach since 2011, but the major milestone he reached in 2015 (1,000 wins) made us wonder about what other men’s college basketball coaches have the most wins of all time. Here's a look at the 10 winningest coaches in college basketball history.

<h2>10. Lute Olson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_775265" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-775265" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Lute-Olson_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images-1024x685.jpg" alt="Lute Olson watches from the sideline." width="757" height="506" /> Lute Olson put Arizona basketball on the map. | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament Titles:</span> 1</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Fours:</span> 5</li>
</ul>
Lute Olson is responsible for putting the Arizona Wildcats on the college basketball map. After stints with Long Beach State (one season) and Iowa (nine seasons), he took over at Arizona and went on to spend the final 24 years of his illustrious coaching career leading the Wildcats. In 2002, Olson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame; in 2006, he was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.

<h2>9. Lefty Driesell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_775267" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-775267" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Lefty-Driesell_Brian-Bahr_Getty-Images-1024x684.jpg" alt="Lefty Driesell looks on critically." width="757" height="506" /> Lefty Driesell is most well known for his time at Maryland. | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

</ul>
Lefty Driesell never guided any of his teams to a national title or Final Four appearance, but he is still one of the winningest coaches in college basketball history. He had stints at Davidson (nine seasons), Maryland (17 seasons), James Madison (nine seasons), and Georgia State (six seasons). Driesell is the man responsible for starting the "Midnight Madness" craze (at Maryland). He joined the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007.

<h2>8. Eddie Sutton</h2>

</ul>
Eddie Sutton has held some of the most prestigious jobs in the country and he's also a bona fide college basketball legend. He started his career at Creighton and then had stops at Arkansas and Kentucky before landing the job that he is most well known for -- Oklahoma State. In 2007, he took the interim head-coaching job at the University of San Francisco for the sole purpose of getting his 800th career win.

In total, Sutton took his teams to three Final Fours (one with Arkansas and two with Oklahoma State), won two AP Coach of the Year awards, and was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.

<h2>7. Roy Williams</h2>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament Titles:</span> 2</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Fours:</span> 8</li>
</ul>
Roy Williams has amassed over 800 career wins (and he's still going strong) while holding only two jobs over the course of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-5-ncaa-coaches-send-the-most-players-to-the-top-of-the-nba-draft.html/">his outstanding coaching career</a>. He began his career in 1988 at Kansas, where he went on to win a total of 418 games and make <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-which-coaches-have-the-most-final-four-appearances.html/">four Final Four</a> appearances.

Williams landed his "dream job" at North Carolina in 2003, and has since guided the Tar Heels to 392 wins, four Final Four appearances, and two national championships. Despite his career being far from over, Williams joined the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 and the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007.

During that time he turned the Wildcats into <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-nba-players-who-were-kentucky-wildcats.html/">one of the premier programs</a> in the country, and established himself as a college basketball legend.

Jim Calhoun retired as the head coach of the University of Connecticut men’s basketball program following the 2011<span class="s1">–</span>12 season. He spent the first 14 years of his career at Northeastern, followed by 26 years at UConn. At UConn, he won three national titles, and at the time of his retirement, he was one win ahead of the great Adolph Rupp on the all-time coaching wins list.

Dean Smith spent his entire 36-year head coaching career at the University of North Carolina. During that span he won 17 regular-season conference titles, 13 conference tournaments, and two national titles. At the time of Smith’s retirement, he held the record for the most wins in a college basketball coaching career. After his death in 2015, Smith's estate <a href="https://twitter.com/ChestPassDemps/status/581137411469647873" target="_blank">delivered $200</a> to each of his former lettermen so they could enjoy a "dinner out."

</ul>
Bob Knight, who became well-known for losing his cool at times, won 102 games as the head coach of Army, 659 games as the head coach at Indiana, and 138 games as the head coach at Texas Tech. He won all three of his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-teams-with-the-most-college-basketball-championships.html/">national championships at Indiana</a>. At the time of his retirement, Knight held the record for the most wins in a college basketball coaching career.

<h2>2.  Jim Boeheim</h2>
[caption id="attachment_775628" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-775628" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jim-Boeheim_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jim Boeheim instructs his players from the sideline." width="757" height="505" /> Jim Boeheim is one of the all-time greats. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Wins:</span>  1,003*</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament Titles:</span>  1</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Fours:</span>  5</li>
</ul>
This one comes with a major caveat. Jim Boeheim has held the Syracuse job since the 1976<span class="s1">–</span>77 season. Over the course of that time he coached the Orange to 1,003 total wins. However, thanks to an investigation into the Syracuse athletic department, 101 of Boeheim's wins were vacated due to the <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/orangebasketball/index.ssf/2016/10/syracuse_basketball_ncaa_vacated_wins.html" target="_blank">use of ineligible players</a>. Even with the vacated wins, though, Boeheim still ranks second on this list.

In total Boeheim coached his teams to five Final Four appearances and one national title. He joined the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2005 and the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Boeheim originally planned on retiring in 2018, but recently said that the 2016–17 season could be his last.

<em>*101 of Boeheim's wins are not recognized by the NCAA.</em>

<h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Mike Krzyzewski</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_525507" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-525507 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coach-K_Duke.jpg" alt="Coach K looks up at the scoreboard." width="757" height="504" /> Coach K is the king of college basketball. | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Wins:</span>  1,070</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament Titles:</span>  5</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final Fours:</span>  12</li>
</ul>
Coach Mike Krzyzewski spent five years as the head coach at Army before taking the job at Duke. All he has done in his time at Duke is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-colleges-with-the-most-valuable-basketball-players.html/">win five national titles</a>, make 12 Final Fours, win 12 regular-season conference titles, and 14 conference tournament titles. The only active coach within striking distance of Coach K on the all-time wins list is Jim Boeheim of Syracuse, and he is a long shot at best (thanks to his vacated wins).

Coach K will likely put this record out of reach, as his program <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-vegas-is-now-picking-to-win-the-2016-ncaa-championship.html/">shows no signs</a> of slowing down.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_588527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Duke-Blue-Devils-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Coach Krzyzewski talks to his Duke players." width="757" height="505" /> Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is worth every penny. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

We're so close to the 2017 NCAA Tournament, we can almost taste the madness. And while we don't know if this year's dance will provide us with any <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-cinderella-stories-in-march-madness-history.html/">Cinderella stories</a>, there's one thing we do know: These teams aren't going anywhere without great coaching.

You can have all the talent in the world, but if you don’t have a capable person pulling the strings, then it won’t make a difference. The fact is, if you want to be successful in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-basketball-top-5-teams-for-2016-17.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college basketball</a>, then you better have a great coach. Unfortunately, bringing in that kind of talent will cost you. Big time.

<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today</a> did the research, put together the data, and figured out which coaches in college basketball were paid the most in 2016. It used specific <a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/2016/03/30/2016-mens-basketball-coaches-pay-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methodology</a> to come to these conclusions and focused on the 68 coaches who led their teams to the NCAA tournament last season. If there's anything to take away from this list, it's that some coaches earn <em>significantly</em> more money than others. The 10 highest-paid coaches in college basketball are proof of that.

<h2>10. Kevin Ollie, Connecticut</h2>
[caption id="attachment_630976" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-630976" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kevin-Ollie-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin Ollie coaches against South Florida." width="757" height="518" /> UConn got it right with Kevin Ollie. | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $3,100,000
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $336,665

When Jim Calhoun decided to step down as UConn's basketball coach, some folks believed the program was in serious trouble. The legendary coach, however, was confident the Huskies would be fine under his successor, Kevin Ollie. And boy was he right. Since taking over the gig in 2012–13, the former point guard has gone 111-60 (.649 winning percentage), led Connecticut to the tournament twice, and won the whole enchilada <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/kevin-ollie-1.html">back in 2014</a>. People should really listen to Calhoun when he speaks; the coach <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-talking-the-tourney-with-former-uconn-coach-jim-calhoun.html/">knows what he's talking about</a>.

<h2>9. Gregg Marshall, Wichita State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773298" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-773298" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Gregg-Marshall-Dilip-Vishwanat-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Wichita State's Gregg Marshall directs his players." width="757" height="505" /> Gregg Marshall has helped put Wichita State on the map. | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $3,130,000
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $838,000

If teams know what's good for them, they won't ever take Wichita State lightly. Fans of the program can thank Gregg Marshall for that. Since becoming the Shockers' head coach back in 2007–08 -- following an extremely successful stint at Winthrop -- Marshall has amassed a .745 winning percentage (260-89), been to six NCAA tournaments (including 2017), won four Missouri Valley Conference regular-season titles and two conference tournament championships, and went to the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/gregg-marshall-1.html">Final Four in 2013</a>.

Although plenty of big-name programs have tried to lure Marshall away, Wichita State is more than willing to open its checkbook to prevent that from happening.

<h2>8. Tom Crean, Indiana</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773303" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-773303" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tom-Crean-Dylan-Buell-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Tom Crean chats with one of his players." width="757" height="505" /> Indiana has paid a pretty penny for Tom Crean's services. | Dylan Buell/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $3,152,867
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $740,000

After a <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/tom-crean-1.html">bang-up job at Marquette</a>, Tom Crean became the head coach at Indiana back in 2008. During his time in Bloomington, the Hoosiers have gone 165-133 (.554 winning percentage), won the Big Ten regular-season title twice, and been to the dance four times. Unfortunately, despite being the eighth highest-paid college basketball coach in 2016, Crean has yet to bring Indiana that one thing its fans crave more than anything else -- a national championship.

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update, 3/16/17: Indiana University fired Tom Crean after nine years with the team.</span></i>

<h2>7. Jamie Dixon, TCU</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773279" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-773279" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Jamie-Dixon-Justin-K.-Aller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jamie Dixon barks orders at his TCU players." width="757" height="530" /> Jamie Dixon barks orders at his TCU players. | Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $3,234,437
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: N/A

Although Jamie Dixon now coaches at his alma mater (TCU), this salary -- from the 2016 campaign -- is definitely indicative of the success he had during his 13 seasons calling the shots at Pittsburgh. From 2003–04 to 2015–16, Dixon <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/jamie-dixon-1.html">went 328-123</a> (.727 winning percentage), won two Big East regular-season crowns and a conference tournament title, and led the Panthers to the NCAA tournament 11 times. The Horned Frogs definitely have a legit head coach in Dixon.

<h2>6. Bob Huggins, West Virginia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773289" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-773289" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bob-Huggins-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Bob Huggins offers some advice." width="757" height="505" /> Bob Huggins has earned his paycheck at West Virginia. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $3,340,000
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $690,000

West Virginia isn't naturally thought of as a college basketball powerhouse, but that all changed once Bob Huggins came back to town. Since taking over his alma mater back in 2007, Huggins has led the Mountaineers to seven NCAA tournaments (No. 8 is coming in 2017), one Final Four appearance (2010), and an overall record of 225-117 (.658 winning percentage). With Huggins at the helm, West Virginia is, in a word, legit. That's all there is to it.

<h2>5. Tom Izzo, Michigan State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719071" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719071" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/461826411-627x500.jpg" alt="Michigan State's Tom Izzo gives his instructions. " width="757" height="603" /> Tom Izzo is Michigan State. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $4,150,359
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $350,000

There are coaches who lead their teams to big-time wins, and then there is <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/tom-izzo-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michigan State’s Tom Izzo</a>. When it comes to preparing his teams for postseason play, the Spartans coach is in a league of his own. Izzo has spent his entire college coaching career -- over 20 years --in East Lansing. During that time he’s accomplished a ridiculous amount. Michigan State has won seven regular-season Big Ten titles, five conference tournament championships, and been to the NCAA tournament 19 times.

Once in the big dance, Izzo and his Spartans tend to turn it up a notch, which is why he’s been to the Final Four 7 times and <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/michigan-state/2000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut down the nets in 2000</a>. With a resume like his, it’s surprising that Izzo is only fifth on the list.

<h2>4. Bill Self, Kansas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_767657" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-767657" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bill-Self-640x426.jpg" alt="Bill Self instructs his Kansas players." width="757" height="504" /> The Kansas Jayhawks have been money under Bill Self. | John Weast/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $4,943,776
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $525,000

Bill Self wins. He <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/bill-self-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wins a lot</a>. The 2003–04 season marked his first as the man in charge of the Kansas Jayhawks. From that point on, the program has pretty much been unrivaled in college basketball. At this moment in time, the Jayhawks have won 13 straight Big 12 Conference regular-season championships. Who knows when that streak will end.

On top of that, Self has also led Kansas to 12 consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (soon to be 13), where they’ve reached the Final Four twice and won it all in 2008. It's no wonder they pay him the big bucks.

<h2>3. Sean Miller, Arizona</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716400" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716400" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sean-Miller-Chris-Coduto-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Sean Miller coaches his Arizona Wildcats team." width="757" height="551" /> Arizona struck gold with Sean Miller. | Chris Coduto/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $4,945,664
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $1,260,000

In Sean Miller, the Arizona Wildcats have one of the finest coaches in all of college basketball. He took over the program in 2009–10 -- following an extremely successful stint at Xavier -- and continued his <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/sean-miller-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning ways</a>, amassing a record of 215-65 (.768 winning percentage), while leading the Wildcats to three Pac-12 regular season crowns and one conference tournament title. With Miller at the helm, the sky's the limit for Arizona basketball. And he has almost 5 million reasons to feel comfortable about his current situation.

<h2>2. John Calipari, Kentucky</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $6,875,376
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: $50,000

When Kentucky looked to return its storied program back to prominence, the university brought in John Calipari. We think -- and so does everyone else -- the brass got the right man for the job. Coach Cal has been in Lexington since the 2009–10 season, and the Wildcats have been a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/can-you-guess-john-calipari-all-time-starting-lineup-at-kentucky.html/">juggernaut ever since</a>. He has won 243 games, accumulated an absurd .824 winning percentage, taken the Cats to three Final Fours, and added a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=320930096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banner to the rafters in 2012</a>. That’s not only how you earn your money, it’s how you become a legend. Kentucky couldn’t have asked for a better man in charge.

<h2>1. Mike Krzyzewski, Duke</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773307" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-773307" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mike-Krzyzewski-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x450.jpg" alt="Duke's Mike Krzyzewski calls out a play." width="757" height="532" /> There's only one Coach K. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total pay</span>: $7,299,666
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Max bonus</span>: N/A

What Mike Krzyzewski has done at Duke <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/coaches/mike-krzyzewski-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since taking over in 1980</a> is simply remarkable. During his time on the Blue Devils' bench, Coach K has won 993 games (1,066 for his career), 12 ACC regular season championships, and 13 conference titles. He's led the Blue Devils to 12 Final Fours and won five National Championships, including back-to-back in 1991 and 1992.

Krzyzewski has forged a legacy that folks in the sport could only dream of. He is one of the best coaches in college basketball history, if not <em>the</em> best. The Duke Blue Devils may play at Cameron Indoor Stadium, but it will always be “<a href="http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2000/11/20/ks-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coach K Court</a>."

		<description><![CDATA[Success in college sports is loosely related to the money a university's athletic department makes. Here are the 7 schools that bring in the most money.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_805758" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-805758 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/texas-longhorns-e1432743274706.jpg" alt="College Sports: 7 Schools That Bring in the Most Money" width="757" height="476" /> Texas Longhorns | Brett Deering/Getty Images[/caption]

In case you didn’t know, there is a clear correlation between <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/colleges-with-the-most-players-in-the-nfl-right-now.html/">success in college sports</a> -- especially in the recruiting game -- and the money generated by a university’s athletic department. It doesn’t necessarily matter which came first. If a school’s team wins, then the money will come in. And if the money comes in, then the programs are more likely to find themselves in a position to be victorious. It’s the classic “chicken and egg" scenario of college athletics. Which universities are in the most prosperous situations? We’re glad you asked.

USA Today -- using <a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances/" target="_blank">financial data from the 2014-15 fiscal year</a> -- has released its ranking of colleges, based solely on the total revenue generated by their athletic departments. It should come as no surprise that this list features a lot of familiar faces. These are big-time universities, with major athletic programs and super devoted fan bases. However, what may throw you for the biggest loop is the order in which these colleges sit. This is where things get interesting.

Of course, it should be noted that these rankings only consist of public schools, as they are the only colleges required to release their figures. Still, for the most part, all the big players are in the mix. Please, for your own sake, read this while sitting down. The amount of money generated by some of these schools is so high that it may actually knock you off your feet. With that, here’s a look at the seven richest athletic departments in college sports.
<h2>7. LSU Tigers</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $138,642,237

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $121,947,775

Not only did the total expenses of the LSU athletic department decrease from $122.9 million in 2014 to $121.9 million in 2015, but the school's total revenue went up as well. What was once $133.7 million (in 2014) has since become $138.6 million (in 2015). LSU reached this total by receiving $41.8 million from ticket sales, $39.5 million from contributions, $49.9 million from rights/licensing, and $7.5 million from other areas.

<h2>6. Florida Gators</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $147,105,242

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $125,384,443

Success in college athletics has been nothing new for the Florida Gators. This time, however, it's all about the money. In 2015, on the back of $58.1 million in contributions, $24.3 million in ticket sales, $55.5 million from rights/licensing, and $4.9 million from other areas, the university's athletic department pulled in a cool $147.1 million in total revenue. Something tells us that with a haul like this, continued prosperity on the field is sure to follow.
<h2>5. Alabama Crimson Tide</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $148,911,674

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $132,354,913

You can’t talk about wealthy college athletic departments and not have Alabama as part of the discussion. That's simply the beauty that comes with having Nick Saban as a football coach and <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/alabama-wins-cfp-title-with-fourth-quarter-special-teams-magic-051819923-ncaaf.html" target="_blank">winning national championships</a>. If you succeed on the gridiron in college, you can bet the money will soon follow.

In 2015, the Crimson Tide athletic department amassed a little over $148.9 million in total revenue. The most money came from rights/licensing ($56.6 million) but athletics also made $39.2 million in ticket sales, $29.4 million in contributions, and $15.8 million from other areas. On top of that, the athletic department received roughly $7.9 million from school funds.

<h2>4. Michigan Wolverines</h2>
[caption id="attachment_736197" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-736197" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Michigan-Football.jpg" alt="College Sports: 7 Schools That Bring in the Most Money" width="757" height="505" /> Michigan Wolverines | Dave Reginek/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $152,477,026

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $151,144,964

The University of Michigan isn't the wealthiest athletic department in the Big Ten Conference, but it's definitely in the top two. Thanks to $46.4 million from ticket sales, $35.7 million from contributions, $58.1 million from rights/licensing, $263,345 from school funds, and just under $12 million from other areas, the Wolverines' athletic department pulled in $152,477,026 in total revenue in 2015. That’s a solid take right there. And because of that, you know who’s smiling? <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-jim-harbaugh-is-reinventing-recruiting-at-michigan.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">This guy</a>.
<h2>3. Ohio State Buckeyes</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $167,166,065

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $154,033,208

The Ohio State Buckeyes have more going for them than simply residing in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-college-sports-towns-in-the-country.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">top college sports town</a> in the country. They also boast a rich athletic program -- the richest in the Big Ten, in fact. With a total operating revenue of around $167.2 million, Ohio State had an extremely lucrative 2015. This total came as a result of $63.1 million in ticket sales, $33 million in contributions, $57.1 million from rights/licensing, $75,470 in school funds, and $13.8 million in other areas.

<h2>2. Texas Longhorns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_569980" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-569980" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Texas-Longhorns-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-640x444.jpg" alt="College Sports: 7 Schools That Bring in the Most Money" width="757" height="525" /> Texas Longhorns | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $183,521,028

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $173,248,133

In regard to money generated by athletic departments, the Texas Longhorns are accustomed to finishing in the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-revenue-college-sports-2014-9" target="_blank">top position</a>. However, in 2015, all this university did was lead the land in total expenses -- just over $173.2 million. Yet, there is no shame in coming in second place here, especially if that means the school brought in roughly $183.5 million.

Texas made $63.3 million in ticket sales, $44.3 million from contributions, $62.9 from rights/licensing, and $13.1 million from other areas. With this amount of money in the athletic department war chest, we don’t see any reason why the Texas Longhorns won’t hook their opponents in the near future.
<h2>1. Texas A&amp;M Aggies</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Revenue</span>: $192,608,876

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Expenses</span>: $109,313,651

We guess it's true what they say: Everything is bigger in Texas.

Of course, this time around it's Texas A&amp;M doing the heavy lifting. In 2015, the Aggies' athletic department proved to be the <a href="http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances" target="_blank">wealthiest in the land</a>, pulling in a whopping $192,608,876. That's what happens when you generate $45.8 million from ticket sales, $92.1 million from contributions, $47 million from rights/licensing, and $7.7 million from other areas. For head football coach Kevin Sumlin, with a ton of bank at his disposal, we guess there's only one thing left to do: win.

		<description><![CDATA[By capping off his career with a national title, can Clemson's Deshaun Watson officially stake his claim as one of the all-time great college football QBs?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_749156" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749156" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Deshaun-Watson-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Deshaun Watson runs down the field after throwing a touchdown pass." width="757" height="505" /> Deshaun Watson secured his place among the all-time greats | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Alabama was on track to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/great-college-football-teams-of-all-time.html">greatest college football team of all time</a>. A victory over the Clemson Tigers in the 2017 CFP National Championship Game would've all but secured it. Yet, as it turns out, on a night when it looked like Nick Saban and the Tide would win their fifth title in eight years, fate had other plans.

After falling short on this same stage a season ago, Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson refused to be denied a second time. Instead, the All-American saved his finest performance for last, throwing for 420 yards and amassing four total touchdowns (three passing, one rushing), including a game-winning two-yard touchdown pass with one tick left on the clock. With this <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2017-01-09-alabama.html">35-31 victory</a>, Clemson earned its first national title in 35 years. As for the team's star quarterback, well, let's just say he cemented his legacy for all of eternity.

College football has had its fair share of historically great quarterbacks. Following this latest masterpiece <span class="s1">-- </span>along with a career that saw him throw for 10,168 yards and 90 touchdowns while rushing for another 1,929 yards and 26 scores <span class="s1">-- </span>one can easily make the case Watson deserves a spot on the list. If that's the case, the question is, who else joins him?

With that being said, in no particular order, here's our full list of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of college football.

<h2>1. Roger Staubach, Navy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_624661" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-624661" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roger-Staubach_Todd-Warshaw_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Roger Staubach speaks to the press during a media conference." width="757" height="505" /> Roger Staubach changed the game at Navy | Todd Warshaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 3,799 passing yards, 18 TD, 20 interceptions

Don't let the tame numbers fool you; Roger Staubach completely changed college football <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-served-us-military.html/">at Navy</a>. During his three seasons with the Midshipmen, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-wealthiest-nfl-players-of-all-time.html/">future real estate mogul</a> completed 63.7% of his passes and led the program to a No. 2 finish in the AP poll in 1963. By the time his collegiate career ended, Staubach was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-dallas-cowboys-players-ever.html/">handsomely rewarded</a> for his individual greatness, earning All-American honors and winning both the Heisman and Maxwell Trophies.

<h2>2. Doug Flutie, Boston College</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742386" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742386" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Doug-Flutie-Rick-Stewart-Allsport-Getty-Images-640x425.jpg" alt="Doug Flutie rests between plays." width="757" height="503" /> Doug Flutie was magical at Boston College | Rick Stewart/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 10,759 passing yards, 70 TD, 56 interceptions; 969 rushing yards, 7 rushing TD

At 5-foot-10, Doug Flutie wasn't exactly a giant on the college football gridiron. Yet, thanks to his toughness, grit, and competitive spirit, the Boston College superstar emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-of-the-greatest-comebacks-in-college-football-history.html/">most magical players</a> in college football history.

Flutie's career year came in 1984, when he threw for 3,364 yards, 30 touchdowns and 13 interceptions; completed one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-greatest-hail-mary-passes-of-all-time.html/">most miraculous Hail Mary passes ever</a>; and stocked his trophy case with everything from the Heisman Trophy to the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award. If there's anything to take away from Flutie's career, it's that one <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-oldest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">should never underestimate</a> the heart of a champion.

<h2>3. Cam Newton, Auburn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_556769" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-556769 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cam-Newton_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Cam Newton speaks to the media during a press conference." width="757" height="507" /> Cam Newton dominated at Auburn | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 2,908 passing yards, 30 TD, 7 interceptions; 1,586 rushing yards, 20 rushing TD

Although <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-nfl-players-2016.html/">Cam Newton</a> rarely got on the field during his time with the Florida Gators, his sensational 2010 campaign at Auburn was enough to secure his legacy as one of the greats. During that season, Newton completed 66.1% of his passes, amassed <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/cam-newton-1.html">52 total touchdowns</a>, and led the Tigers to an undefeated 14-0 record and a victory over Oregon in the BCS Championship Game.

As a result, the All-American QB received the Davey O'Brien Award, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Player of the Year Award, SEC Offensive Player of the Year Award, and, of course, the Heisman Trophy.

<h2>4. Vince Young, Texas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742393" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742393" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Vince-Young-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vince Young speaks to the crowd before a Texas crowd." width="757" height="505" /> Vince Young is a Texas legend | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 6,040 passing yards, 44 TD, 28 interceptions; 3,127 rushing yards, 37 rushing TD

Like Newton, Texas's Vince Young needed just one astonishing college football season to earn a place among the all-time greats. In 2005, the Longhorns' dual-threat quarterback completed 65.2% of his passes, threw for 3,036 passing yards 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and added another <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/vince-young-1.html">1,050 yards and 12 scores on the ground</a>. While he didn't come away with the Heisman that year, Young found himself on the winning end of something much more special --  a national championship. For that, he will always be one of Texas's favorite sons.

<h2>5. Peyton Manning, Tennessee</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742396" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742396" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Peyton-Manning-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning holds his jersey at Tennessee." width="757" height="637" /> Peyton Manning had a phenomenal career at Tennessee | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 11,201 passing yards, 89 TD, 33 interceptions

Unlike many of today's college quarterbacks, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-hall-fame-career.html/">Peyton Manning</a> stayed in school all four years. While he never won the Heisman Trophy, he certainly made the most of his time at Tennessee. In Manning's standout season of 1997, the All-American <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/peyton-manning-1.html">threw for 3,819 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions</a>, and led the Volunteers to an 11-2 mark and the No. 7 ranking in the final AP poll.

To no one's surprise, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-peyton-manning.html/">he earned</a> a ridiculous amount of individual college football hardware that year, including the Davey O'Brien Award, SEC Player of the Year, Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and Maxwell Award.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Tim Tebow, Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746440" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746440" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tim-tebow.jpg" alt="Tim Tebow greets fans at Florida." width="757" height="505" /> Tim Tebow is one of Florida's most beloved players | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 9,285 passing yards, 88 TD, 16 interceptions; 2,947 rushing yards, 57 rushing TD

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tim-tebow-go-away.html/">Say what you will</a> about Tim Tebow's lackluster time in the NFL, but as the quarterback for the Florida Gators, he was a game-changer. Tebow was a minor contributor in the Gator’s BCS Championship run in 2006, but he was the star on their title team in 2008. Besides <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/tim-tebow-1.html">winning two championships with the Gators</a>, he also took home a slew of individual college football awards.

His main haul came in 2007, when he won the Davey O’Brien Award, Maxwell Award, AP Player of the Year Award, and Heisman Trophy. Today he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-most-popular-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html/">is a cultural icon</a>, as well as a <a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">social media phenomenon</a>; to the Gators faithful, he will always be their All-American.

<h2>7. Matt Leinart, USC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746442" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746442" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Matt-Leinart.jpg" alt="Matt Leinart looks for a target." width="757" height="527" /> Matt Leinart was the man at USC | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 10,693 passing yards, 99 TD, 23 interceptions

When Matt Leinart played under center <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-college-football-programs.html/">for the USC Trojans</a>, he put up sensational numbers. But, more importantly, he won. A lot.

Leinart was <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/matt-leinart-1/gamelog/" target="_blank">37-2</a> in his career as a starter, helped the Trojans finish first in the AP poll in 2003, and won a BCS Championship the following year. That win may have been vacated due to the scandal of teammate <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-should-retire.html/">Reggie Bush</a>, but Leinart’s dominant play at the quarterback position during his college football tenure cannot be denied. In 2004, he torched teams in the air with more than 3,300 passing yards and 33 touchdowns. As a result, he rightfully earned the Heisman Trophy (among other hardware).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Tommie Frazier, Nebraska</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rnpmicc87zI"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 3,521 passing yards, 43 TD, 11 interceptions; 1,955 rushing yards, 36 rushing TD

The Nebraska Cornhuskers teams of the early '90s are considered among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/great-college-football-teams-of-all-time.html/">best to ever play the game</a>. They won national championships in both 1994 and 1995, and finished both seasons undefeated. The leader of these powerhouses: Tommie Frazier. <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/tommie-frazier-1.html">His numbers</a> may seem particularly gaudy, but it’s what he brought to the field that made him a special college football player.

Frazier was a leader, a dual-threat, and a fierce competitor. Those Cornhuskers teams were fantastic. But, it was Frazier who put them over the top. Ultimately, plays like the above run secured his place in history and contributed to his incredible legacy.

<h2>9. Charlie Ward, Florida State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746467" align="aligncenter" width="573"]<img class="wp-image-746467" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Charlie-Ward-336x500.jpg" alt="Charlie Ward looks for a target down the field." width="573" height="853" /> Charlie Ward is a special athlete | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 5,747 passing yards, 49 TD, 22 interceptions; 889 rushing yards, 10 rushing TD

Charlie Ward was such a gifted athlete at Florida State that he wasn’t just the Seminoles star quarterback; he was also the point guard for the basketball team (he later played in the NBA). But, this is about the gridiron, and <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/charlie-ward-1.html">in 1993</a>, Ward set the standard for the position. That season, Ward finished second in the nation in total touchdowns with 31; first in the country in pass completion percentage (69.5); and fourth in passing efficiency. The Seminoles also won the national championship that year, and Ward led the charge.

In terms of individual college football accolades, let’s just say Ward's trophy case is plenty full from that season alone. He won the Heisman, Davey O’Brien Award, Johnny Unitas Golden Arm, Maxwell Award, and Walter Camp Player of the Year. The All-American is, most certainly, one of the greats.

<h2>10. Danny Wuerffel, Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746452" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-746452" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Danny-Wuerffel.jpg" alt="Danny Wuerffel begins a play." width="757" height="510" /> Danny Wuerffel could sling the pigskin | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics</span>: 10,875 passing yards, 114 TD, 42 interceptions

He never amounted to much at the pro level, but there aren’t enough words to do Danny Wuerffel's college football career justice. His <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/danny-wuerffel-1.html">passing statistics</a> are absolutely mind-blowing, and he led the SEC in total yards in back-to-back seasons (1995 and 1996). The Florida Gators were a national power with Wuerffel under center and won the national championship in 1996.

That year was also a distinguishing one, individually, for the gun-slinger. He threw for 3,625 yards and 39 touchdowns, while accumulating a passer rating of 170.6. In 1996, Wuerffel also took home the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp, and Davey O’Brien. Plus, he earned All-American honors and the SEC Player of the Year Award. Now, that’s how you get remembered.

		<description><![CDATA[In college sports, it pays to be a part of one of the major conferences. Here are the 5 college conferences that generate the most money for their members.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_804595" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804595 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Big-Ten_Ohio-State.jpg" alt="5 College Conferences That Bring in Over $250 Million" width="757" height="505" /> Ohio State celebrates beating Wisconsin. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

If you’ve ever wondered why universities are constantly switching conferences, the answer is simple: Money. If a school is hoping to generate the highest possible amount of revenue from its athletics, then <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-it-pays-to-be-in-the-sec.html/" target="_blank">it always pays to be among the major players in the land of college sports</a>. For if you were under the impression that all conferences were created equal — from a financial standpoint, that is — you’d be sorely mistaken. And Forbes has the numbers to prove it.

As its done in years past, Forbes has crunched the numbers to see how college conferences compare to one another with regard to how much revenue they’ve generated. Looking at the 2014-15 fiscal year, Forbes analyzed the figures according to the three biggest revenue streams in college sports: football bowl games, the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/" target="_blank">NCAA</a> Tournament and conference TV deals.

“Bowl game revenue is a combination of money from the College Football Playoff, which distributed some $400 million among ten conferences last year, and contract bowls," <a href="http://www.Forbes.com">writes Forbes staff member Chris Smith</a>. “The NCAA Tournament’s prize money system operates on a six-year rolling period, with conferences receiving around $250,000 per tournament game played over the last six seasons."

With regard to the TV money — which comes from massive rights fees and, occasionally, profit sharing from conference network partners — Forbes did not average out the annual payout of television contracts, but rather estimated the TV revenue that was earned during the 2014-15 fiscal year.

While the major conferences all generated large quantities of money over the last year, it’s clear that some helped their individual member schools to bank more than the rest. And since it’s always interesting to see why colleges consistently jockey for position as if this was a real-life <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we decided to fill in the blanks by presenting you with the five most valuable conferences in college sports.

<h2>5. ACC</h2>

<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total</span>: $331 million</li>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">TV deals</span>: $212 million</li>
</ul>
After watching the 2015 NCAA Tournament, there was no doubt the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-most-memorable-moments-in-duke-basketball-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Duke Blue Devils</a> proved themselves to be college basketball’s finest team. Yet, even with that individual victory, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) only managed to come in as the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elkmk/1-sec/" target="_blank">fifth most valuable conference</a> in all of college sports.

The majority of the ACC’s money came from it’s $212 million in TV deals, followed by the $98 million associated with Bowl games and $21 million from appearances and games in the NCAA tournament. Under normal circumstances, it’s never fun to come in fifth place. However, there’s no shame in pulling in a total of $331 million over the last year, with each member school getting $22.1 million.

<h2>4. Big 12</h2>
[caption id="attachment_736762" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-736762" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Baylor-Football.jpg" alt="5 College Conferences That Bring in Over $250 Million" width="757" height="474" /> The Baylor Bears celebrate. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total per member school</span>: $25.3 million</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total</span>: $253 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowl games</span>: $72 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament</span>: $19 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">TV deals</span>: $162 million</li>
</ul>
The <a href="http://www.big12sports.com/" target="_blank">Big 12 Conference</a> earned $162 million in TV money, $72 million from Bowl games, and $19 million from its participation in the NCAA tournament. With <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elkmk/4-big-12/" target="_blank">$253 million in total revenue</a>, the Big 12 Conference was actually the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/07/20/the-sec-is-finally-the-most-valuable-conference-in-college-sports/2/" target="_blank">lowest earner of all the Power 5 Conferences</a>.

Yet, since the conference in only made up of 10 members, each school comes away with $25.3 million a piece when the total purse is divided. This is good enough to place the Big 12 at No. 4 on the most valuable conference list.

<h2>3. Pac-12</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742485" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742485" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Oregon-Celebration-640x424.jpg" alt="5 College Conferences That Bring in Over $250 Million" width="757" height="502" /> Oregon Ducks celebrate a Rose Bowl win. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total per member school</span>: $25.5 million</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total</span>: $307 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowl games</span>: $81 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament</span>: $11 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">TV deals</span>: $215 million</li>
</ul>
The total revenue generate by the <a href="http://pac-12.com/" target="_blank">Pac-12 Conference</a> in the past year was $307 million. As it was with most conferences, the bulk of the earnings came from lucrative TV deals. In the case of the Pac-12, that number was $215 million.

On top of that, the conference generate $81 million from Bowl games — props to the Oregon Ducks — and $11 million from the NCAA tournament. With the Pac 12 Conference generating <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elkmk/3-pac-12/" target="_blank">$25.5 million per school</a>, it was able to narrowly top the Big 12 as the third most valuable conference in the land.

<h2>2. Big Ten</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745572" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745572" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ohio-State.jpg" alt="5 College Conferences That Bring in Over $250 Million" width="757" height="505" /> Ohio State celebrates College Football Playoff National Championship victory. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Total per member school</span>: $27.6 million</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total</span>: $386 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bowl games</span>: $86 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament</span>: $21 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">TV deals</span>: $279 million</li>
</ul>
Based on their on-the-field performances this past year, it clear the members of the Big Ten Conference are not to be trifled with. The Ohio State Buckeyes captured the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship and the conference also sent two schools to the Final Four of this year’s NCAA tournament, with Wisconsin falling just short of cutting down the nets.

The Big Ten Conference balls hard and that’s why it brings in big bucks. Its total revenue of $386 million was second among the other conferences, it pulled in $21 million from the NCAA tournament, $86 from Bowl games, and $279 million from TV deals (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/07/20/the-sec-is-finally-the-most-valuable-conference-in-college-sports/2/" target="_blank">21% of the total TV money</a> from last year, according to Forbes).

By bringing in $27.6 million per member school, the Big Ten Conference came in as the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elkmk/2-big-ten/" target="_blank">second most valuable conference</a> in the entire country. We have a feeling its place among the elite is firmly secured.
<h2><!--nextpage-->1.  SEC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_712401" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-712401" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alabama-National-Champions.jpg" alt="5 College Conferences That Bring in Over $250 Million" width="757" height="505" /> Alabama after winning BCS | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total per member school</span>: $34 million</li>

<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total</span>: $476 million</li>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">NCAA Tournament</span>: $17 million</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">TV deals</span>: $347 million</li>
</ul>
We knew the Southeastern Conference (SEC) was in the business of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-it-pays-to-be-in-the-sec.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">making money</a>, but now we’re firmly aware of just how profitable this conference truly is. In the 2014-15 fiscal year, the SEC pulled in a whopping $476 million in total revenue, with $112 million coming from Bowl games — $64 million from the College Football Playoff alone — and $17 million coming from the NCAA tournament.

Of course, the real moneymaker is television. And in that respect, nobody did it better than the SEC. This conference raked in $347 million in TV deal; a number which accounted for 23% of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/07/20/the-sec-is-finally-the-most-valuable-conference-in-college-sports/2/" target="_blank">$1.3 billion dollars generated from TV money alone</a>. With a total revenue per member school of $34 million, the SEC is far and away the most valuable conference in college sports.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_695961" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695961" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/maryland.jpg" alt="The 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="507" /> Source: Maryland Athletics[/caption]

When Maryland Terrapins announced they would wear special <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nfl-teams-that-could-use-a-helmet-makeover.html/" target="_blank">helmets</a> and uniforms to honor the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Baltimore, we thought it was a pretty cool idea. After all, the events of 1814 at Fort McHenry inspired the writing of the United States' national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner." The Terps' helmets featured the words to that famous song and also <a href="http://btn.com/2014/09/09/photo-maryland-unveils-new-under-armour-star-spangled-alternate-uniform/" target="_blank">an outline of Fort McHenry</a>. Seeing this snazzy look got us thinking about other unique, creative college football helmet designs from the past few years. With that in mind, here are 10 of our favorites (in alphabetical order by university). Which ones would you add to the list?
<h2>1. Arizona</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695971" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695971" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/153102930-640x435.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="515" /> Arizona Wildcats | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The Arizona Wildcats introduced a copper helmet in 2012 as a way to recognize the state's mining history. Although the school's traditional colors are red, white, and blue, the <a href="http://www.arizonawildcats.com/sports/2012/9/24/207929805.aspx">university noted</a> that copper has "influenced architectural design" on the school's campus. Rich Rodriguez's team was glad to honor an important part of Arizona's <a href="http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2012/09/wildcats-football-arizona-mining-history-copper-helmets-092712" target="_blank">tradition and economy</a> with an alternate helmet.

<h2>2. Connecticut</h2>

On game day, when you look into the eyes of a UConn Huskies football player, two sets of eyes stare back at you: the player's and those of the husky wolf logo on the front of the helmet. If that's not intimidating, we don't know what is. Connecticut <a href="http://www.uconnhuskies.com/view.gal?id=140250" target="_blank">unveiled the new design</a> before the 2013 season.

<h2>3. Indiana</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695998" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695998 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/450025377-640x426.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="502" /> Indiana Hoosiers | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

The Indiana Hoosiers' basketball team is known for its famous "candy stripe" <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaab-the-dagger/indiana-began-wearing-trademark-candy-striped-warmup-pants-161242553--ncaab.html" target="_blank">warmup pants</a>. The football team went down a similar path when these helmets debuted in the 2013 season. They utilize a distinct striped pattern on an increasingly popular chrome helmet. In fact, IU <a href="http://www.iuhoosiers.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082113aad.html" target="_blank">expanded its helmet options</a> from one to six the same year. However, the striped chrome design is by far the boldest look.

<h2>4. Miami (Ohio)</h2>

Thanks to a distinct feather design, the Miami Redhawks' helmets, introduced in summer 2013, are hard to miss. <a href="http://www.muredhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=208809560" target="_blank">According to the school</a>, the "feathered" helmets recognize the university's "relationship with the Miami Indian tribe," as well as the current Redhawk mascot.

<h2>5. Navy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695956" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695956 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/454385644.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="502" /> Navy Midshipmen | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

The Navy Midshipmen made this list after showing off a new "summer white" uniform look used for their 2014 opener against Ohio State. The helmets, part of a new partnership between the service academy and Under Armour, are "<a href="http://www.navysports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082814aae.html" target="_blank">directly inspired by the covers that the Mids wear</a>."

<h2>6. Northwestern</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695995" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695995 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/450065163-640x431.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="508" /> Northwestern Wildcats | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images[/caption]

We continue in the patriotic vein with the Northwestern Wildcats, who wore (<a href="http://www.nusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110413aab.html" target="_blank">and then auctioned off</a>) special jerseys against Michigan in November 2013 to benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. While the school's logo does appear on the back of the helmet along with the player's number, the defining characteristic of this helmet is the stars-and-stripes combo resembling the American flag.

<h2>7. Oregon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695962 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/185373918-640x375.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="442" /> Oregon Ducks | Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

The Oregon Ducks could surely have an entire list of unique helmet designs to themselves due to the school's close ties with Oregon-based Nike, as well as the team's seemingly endless combinations of helmets, jerseys, pants, gloves, and cleats. But one look that stands out above the rest is the pink helmet the Ducks wore against Washington State back in 2013. The pink <a href="http://www.goducks.com/sports/2013/10/17/209285684.aspx">benefitted an important cause</a>; Oregon used the alternate helmets to “<a href="http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209285362" target="_blank">help create awareness and help raise money</a>” for the Kay Yow Cancer Fund.

<h2>8. Purdue</h2>

In the summer of 2014, the Purdue Boilermakers <a href="https://twitter.com/PurdueSports/status/474218372394389504/photo/1" target="_blank">announced</a> that their helmets for that season's September 27 game versus Iowa would include submitted photos of season ticket holders and students who purchased all-sport season ticket <a href="http://www.purduesports.com/tickets/student-tickets-football.html" target="_blank">VIP Cards</a>. They rearranged the pictures (approximately 240 in all) in the design of the school's traditional logo and replaced the usual helmet decal for Purdue's homecoming game that year. The university provided The Cheat Sheet with the final image, which you can see above.

<h2>9. TCU</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695966" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695966 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/180942301-640x421.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="496" /> TCU Horned Frogs | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The TCU Horned Frogs introduced a new helmet design for the 2013 season opener against LSU. It incorporated red accents along with the usual purple school colors. Why red? <a href="http://news.nike.com/news/tcu-unveils-new-nike-football-uniform-design-for-season-opener" target="_blank">According to Nike</a>, the striking helmet represents a "horned frog's defense mechanism -- a shot of blood from the eyes that repels encroaching foes."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Virginia Tech</h2>
[caption id="attachment_695990" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-695990 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/181960088-640x425.jpg" alt="Top 10 Coolest Helmet Designs in College Football" width="757" height="501" /> Virginia Tech Hokies | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The Virginia Tech Hokies took the field in September 2013 wearing a special "Hokie Stone" helmet, modeled after the <a href="http://collegespun.com/acc/virginia-tech-acc/photo-virginia-tech-to-wear-its-new-hokie-stone-helmets-this-thursday" target="_blank">limestone found in the Blacksburg area</a>. As former head coach <a href="http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/20130923aac.html" target="_blank">Frank Beamer said</a> prior to the the game: "It's something we're proud of. The reason I like it is because it represents what this program and this university are built on. Each piece, in its place, serving its purpose, doing its job, and when it's all working together, it's rock solid and it's something special." The helmet design also included the year Virginia Tech was founded, 1872.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[As the Oregon Ducks continue to struggle, it might be time to make a change at the top. Here's a look at 5 possible coaching replacements for Mark Helfrich.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_717710" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717710" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mark-Helfrich-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images-e1477485327263.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for the Oregon Ducks' Mark Helfrich" width="757" height="550" /> Mark Helfrich's time at Oregon could come to an end | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

There's a simple reason why the top college football coaches <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-football-coaches-2016.html/">earn big the bucks</a> -- they win. And <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-programs-college-football.html/">they win often</a>. That, after all, is the name of the game. Unfortunately, sometimes, even the best coaches in the game struggle. Their teams stop performing; they can't pull off a victory in the big game; and just like that, the angry mob comes <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/replacements-brian-kelly-notre-dame.html/">calling for their head</a>.

This happens a lot in college football. It may not be fair, but then again, no one ever said it was. As hard as it is to believe, especially since the program hasn't fired a head coach since 1976, this situation has officially come to Eugene, Ore. -- home of the Ducks' <em>former</em> head coach Mark Helfrich.

In four seasons calling the shots for the Oregon Ducks, Helfrich has experienced plenty of success. He's compiled a 37-16 record (.698 winning percentage), won the Rose Bowl, and taken the program to the national championship game. Yet, things have taken a turn for the worse in 2016. This season, the Oregon Ducks finished the regular season with a 4-8 record, including 2-7 in the Pac-12. For a program with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/expensive-college-football-tickets-2016.html/">deep pockets</a>, unrivaled facilities, and crazy high expectations, these poor results were simply too impossible to ignore.

After four seasons as the team's head coach (as well as eight years with the program), <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/18168683/mark-helfrich-oregon-ducks-coach">Helfrich was officially canned</a>. Now Oregon faces the difficult task of finding his successor. While we're sure the search will be exhaustive, if you ask us, these five candidates would make excellent replacements.

<h2>1. Lane Kiffin</h2>

Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

What Lane Kiffin has done since becoming the offensive coordinator at Alabama is nothing short of spectacular. He will be a college football head coach soon enough; it's only a matter of time. Under his guidance, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-college-football-programs.html/">Tide have evolved</a> into one of the most balanced, versatile, and, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/alabama/2016.html">lethal offenses in the country</a>. Whether its pummeling you on the ground or unleashing havoc through the air, Alabama can beat you in a multitude of ways, courtesy of the confidence, creativity, and new life Kiffin has breathed into that side of the ball. Forget about the guy who bombed the last few times he was in the big seat, this is a changed man. Someone will get a fantastic head coach in Lane Kiffin. Why not the Oregon Ducks?

<h2>2. Les Miles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_717722" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717722" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Les-Miles-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for the Oregon Ducks' Mark Helfrich" width="757" height="505" /> Les Miles could thrive at Oregon | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

The time came for Les Miles and LSU to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-les-miles-replacements-lsu.html/">part ways</a>, but that doesn't change the fact that he's a hell of a football coach. During his <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/les-miles-1.html">12 seasons with the Tigers</a>, Miles amassed a record of 114-34 (.770 winning percentage), experienced seven seasons of 10-plus wins, and led the program to a national championship back in 2007. We already know he plans to coach again, as Miles <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17643940/les-miles-plans-coach-again-following-firing-lsu-tigers">told Dan Patrick</a> the following:
<blockquote>I don't golf. I play no tennis. I enjoy shooting the gun; I don't necessarily like to point it at animals. I play cards, not very well. But what I have done for probably 12 to 14 hours a day for the last number of years is coach football. So I would have a difficult time not being involved in the game and not being a coach.</blockquote>
Given his exceptional resume, you'd have to think Miles will have plenty of head-coaching offers to choose from. If they're smart, the Oregon Ducks would be among them.

<h2>3. Bobby Petrino</h2>
[caption id="attachment_717738" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717738" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bobby-Petrino-Grant-Halverson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for the Oregon Ducks' Mark Helfrich" width="757" height="520" /> Oregon would be lucky to have Bobby Petrino at the helm | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

Bobby Petrino has found himself embroiled in more controversies than you'd like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nfl-coaches-who-successfully-returned-to-college-football.html/">from your head football coach</a>, but from an X's and O's standpoint, the guy still remains one of the best in the business. In 2016, his Louisville Cardinals are 6-1, ranked No. 5 in the AP poll, and are <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/louisville/2016.html">putting up 52.6 points per game</a> (first of 128) behind presumptive <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-heisman-trophy-race-players.html/">Heisman frontrunner</a> and quarterback Lamar Jackson. Considering Petrino has gone 106-40 for his career as a head coach, including 64-19 (.771 winning percentage) at Louisville, this should hardly come as a surprise. If the Oregon Ducks find themselves in need of a new head honcho, it'd be wise to gauge Petrino's interest.

<h2>4. Scott Frost</h2>
[caption id="attachment_717715" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717715" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Scott-Frost-Steve-Dykes-Getty-Images-640x368.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for the Oregon Ducks' Mark Helfrich" width="757" height="435" /> Perhaps it's time for Scott Frost to return to Eugene, Ore. | Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

If the Oregon Ducks bring back one of their own, they could do far worse than former offensive coordinator Scott Frost. Now in his first season as the head coach at Central Florida, Frost has led the Knights to a 4-3 record, including 2-1 in conference play. The team is currently putting up 28.1 points per game, and most importantly, is making football at the program <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/ucf-knights/os-scott-frost-first-ucf-game-mike-bianchi-0904-20160903-column.html">fun again</a>. Sometimes, in order to move forward, you must go back. Oregon might want to heed this advice.

<h2>5. Chip Kelly</h2>
[caption id="attachment_717732" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717732" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chip-Kelly-Tom-Szczerbowski-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for the Oregon Ducks' Mark Helfrich" width="757" height="505" /> Chip Kelly is not cutting it in the NFL | Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images[/caption]

Speaking of "going back," the Oregon Ducks should do everything in their power to convince Chip Kelly to return to Eugene. As much as he wants to succeed in the NFL, Kelly's style, tactics, and overall way of thinking suits the college game. Kelly was <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/chip-kelly-1.html">46-7</a> (.868 winning percentage) in his four seasons at Oregon, winning two major bowl games in the process.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-without-hope.html/">thanks to a 1-6 start</a> in his first season with the San Francisco 49ers, Chip is now a combined 27-27 in his four seasons at the professional ranks. If he's not already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-coaches-fired-job-soon.html/">on the hot seat</a>, he will be soon enough. The Niners may not be interested in keeping Kelly around, but we know one place that would be happy to have him back. Just ask Dorothy; there's no place like home.

		<description><![CDATA[If Notre Dame decides to move on from Brian Kelly as the Fighting Irish's head football coach, these 4 individuals would make excellent replacements.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_713529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713529" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brian-Kelly-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for Brian Kelly at Notre Dame" width="757" height="529" /> Brian Kelly's stint at Notre Dame could come to an end | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

A <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-programs-college-football.html/">history of success in college football</a> is a nice thing to have if you want to impress your next crop of recruits. Yet, once the new season begins, the past is the past, and everything boils down to producing results on the field. Heading into the 2016 season, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish -- ranked No. 10 in the <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/rankings/_/seasontype/2/year/2016/week/1">preseason AP Top 25</a> -- looked destined to enjoy the sort of results that would make past teams proud. Unfortunately, things don't always work out as planned.

As we look toward the conference title games of the 2016 college football season, it's safe to say the Fighting Irish are nothing short of a disappointment. After giving up 27.8 points per game (66th of 128), this group finished 4-8 for the year, and has been out of the College Football Playoff conversation for pretty much most of the season. Talk about failing to live up to expectations.

When a program like Notre Dame falls flat on its face, the first thing folks do is figure out where to lay the blame. In this particular case, it's hard not to point the finger at head coach Brian Kelly. While Kelly has gone 59-31 (.656 winning percentage) since taking over the program back in 2010, given this year's showing, perhaps it's time for Notre Dame to reevaluate the head coaching position. If the university decides the time is right to make a change, here's a look at four coaches who would make excellent candidates for the job.

<h2>1. Lane Kiffin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702262" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702262" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Lane-Kiffin_Harry-How_Getty-Images-632x500.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for Brian Kelly at Notre Dame" width="757" height="599" /> Lane Kiffin is ready for another shot as a head coach | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

It's common knowledge that Lane Kiffin struggled as a head coach in the past. But after watching him as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/richest-athletic-departments-college-sports.html/">Alabama Crimson Tide</a>'s offensive coordinator over the past three seasons, it's safe to say he'll get another shot at the big seat. Since joining <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nfl-coaches-who-successfully-returned-to-college-football.html/">Nick Saban</a>'s staff back in 2014, Kiffin has helped the Tide evolve into an offensive juggernaut, produced with multiple quarterbacks, and was a major reason why the squad won a national championship in 2015.

This season, Alabama is the No. 1 team in the country at 12-0, is putting up <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/alabama/2016.html">39.4 points per game</a> (18th of 128), and is embarrassing the competition to the tune of 479.6 total yards of offense per contest. Kiffin might be a tough sell at Notre Dame, but there's no denying his big-time talent. The folks in South Bend could do a whole lot worse.

<h2>2. Les Miles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_582668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582668" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Les-Miles-Brett-Carlsen-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for Brian Kelly at Notre Dame" width="757" height="505" /> Les Miles is itching for his next gig | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/les-miles-1.html">going 114-34</a> (.770 winning percentage) and winning a national championship during <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-football-coaches-2016.html/">his 12 seasons at LSU</a>, the time came for Les Miles and the Tigers to part ways. And now that he's on the open market, we have a feeling Miles will be a hot commodity. He has won at multiple programs (he has a career record of 142-55). He consistently competed in the tough terrain of the SEC and is beloved by his players. Should Notre Dame find itself looking for a new head coach, Miles should rank near the top on the list of replacements.

<h2>3. Bob Stoops</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713554" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713554" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bob-Stoops-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for Brian Kelly at Notre Dame" width="757" height="540" /> Maybe it's time for Bob Stoops to leave Norman, Okla. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Bob Stoops' resume speaks for itself. During his <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/bob-stoops-1.html">18 seasons at Oklahoma</a>, "Big Game Bob" has amassed a record of 188-48 (.797 winning percentage). The 56-year-old produced 13 double-digit win seasons and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/shameful-teams-college-football-good.html/">led the Sooners</a> to a national title in 2000. Unfortunately, fans can turn on you in a second, and it wouldn't surprise us if Stoops was ready for a new challenge. We're not suggesting Stoops should leave -- or be forced to leave. However, if this ends up being the case, the Fighting Irish would be foolish not to gauge his interest.

<h2>4. Urban Meyer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713535" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713535" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Urban-Meyer-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="5 Potential Replacements for Brian Kelly at Notre Dame" width="757" height="505" /> Ohio State's Urban Meyer is one of the biggest names in college football | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

It seems ridiculous to suggest that Urban Meyer would ever consider leaving Ohio State. After all, since <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/urban-meyer-1.html">taking over the reins</a> in Columbus, he's led the Buckeyes to a 61-5 mark. The 52-year-old consistently brings in one of the country's best recruiting classes, and has already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-programs-college-football.html/">won a national championship</a>. When a situation is this good, what would be the point of walking away? How about the chance to finally land your "<a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/Urban-Meyer-ND-Still-My-Dream-Job.html">dream job</a>"? Notre Dame let Meyer get away before. Should the opportunity present itself once again, the university would be wise not to let it happen a second time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_676168" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676168" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Michigan-Wolverines-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-640x487.jpg" alt="It's all Wolverines | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="576" /> It's all Wolverines | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

As much as we love the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">NFL</a>, we happen to believe there is something even more special about college football. And we’re sure <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-teams-fans-come-see.html/">we’re not alone</a>.

For those talented players fortunate enough to lace ‘em up at a premiere Division I program, the game is not about dollars and endorsement deals. It’s not allowed to be (whether or not that’s right is a debate for another time). It’s about passion and pride and school spirit. And when we’re talking about things such as these we can’t help but get a bit sentimental.

The fact is, not all of these individuals will be good enough to make it to the next level. Their time in college may be their last opportunity to strap on the helmet and play the sport that’s dominated their existence for much of their lives. There’s something poetic about that. Something beautiful about trying to leave it on the field, without any regrets. This time, you play for your teammates, yourself, and a national championship. Of course, when it comes to the latter, some programs will certainly provide you with a better opportunity to achieve that goal.

At some schools, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-greatest-venues-in-america.html/">college football is an institution</a>. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-best-tailgates-in-the-country.html/">fans are crazy supportive</a>, the boosters are incredibly involved, and the expectations for success are sky high. These are the places the country’s top recruits want to play at. Programs with top-of-the-line resources, incredible support, and a history of success. Like anything involving wins and losses and competition, <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2016/fbs.pdf" target="_blank">some schools rise above the rest</a>.

When examining the best of the best in college athletics, it’s all about the <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/football/fbs" target="_blank">Football Bowl Subdivision</a> (FBS). And while some of the programs within this division, have had wins vacated by the NCAA, for this particular examination, we’re not going to take those into consideration. This is about the teams that bring home the most Ws. So if you’re looking to win in college football, these are the places that have made it part of their mission for an extended period of time.

With the 2016 season now in full swing, here’s a look at the five winningest programs in college football history.

<h2>5. Ohio State Buckeyes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_582038" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582038" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/J.T.-Barrett-Jamie-Sabau-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt=" Jamie Sabau/Getty ImagesCOLUMBUS, OH - NOVEMBER 21: Quarterback J.T.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wins</span>: 885

After ending the 2015 season on a high note, a 44-28 victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in the Fiesta Bowl, the Ohio State Buckeyes finished the year with a <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/ohio-state/2015.html">12-1 mark</a>, and increased the program's overall win total to an impressive 875 victories.

Despite losing a number key players in the NFL draft, Urban Meyer and company entered the 2016 season as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-college-football-teams-2016.html/">No. 6-ranked team in the country</a>, determined to regain their spot at the top of the college football mountain. Heading into Week 13, the Buckeyes are 10-1, upping the program's overall win total to 885, and have climbed to the No. 2 spot in the latest AP poll. Given the way this team has performed so far this season, we expect the program's total win haul to increase dramatically.

<h2>4. Nebraska Cornhuskers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696626" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696626" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/455178886.jpg" alt="The 5 Winningest Programs in College Football History" width="757" height="497" /> Nebraska catch against McNeese State | Eric Francis/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wins</span>: 889

Despite coming off of back-to-back <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/nebraska/" target="_blank">9-4 seasons</a>, the Nebraska Cornhuskers failed to reestablish themselves among the college football elite in 2015. In his first season as head coach, Mike Riley led the team to a 6-7 mark, including a sorry 3-5 record in conference play, and the program saw it's overall win total increased to 880. So far in 2016, however, we've seen a major turnaround from the Cornhuskers.

After the first 12 weeks of the season, Nebraska is 9-2 (increasing the school's win total 889), has climbed to No. 10 in the AP Top 25, and has all the makings of a team on the rise. While we'd hate to speak too soon, it looks like the current Cornhuskers have <em>finally</em> started to live up to Nebraska's rich history of success. Here's to hoping they can keep it up.

<h2>3. Texas Longhorns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590546" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590546" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bryce-Cottrell-Ron-Jenkins-Getty-Images-640x404.jpg" alt="Ron Jenkins/Getty Images" width="757" height="478" /> Don't mess with Texas | Ron Jenkins/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wins</span>: 889

Coming into the 2015 season, the Texas Longhorns ranked <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2015/fbs.pdf" target="_blank">third on the all-time college football wins list</a> with 881 total victories. By the end of the year, their position remained the same; albeit with 886 total wins. Unfortunately, that's not necessarily a good thing.

The Longhorns went <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/texas/2015.html">5-7 in 2015</a>, including a lackluster 4-5 record in Big 12 play. If head coach Charlie Strong, who's now entering his third season in charge, isn't able to turn things around (so far in 2016, the Longhorns are 3-5), he may find himself <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-replacements-for-charlie-strong-as-head-coach-at-texas.html/?a=viewall">looking for a new job after the 2016 season</a>.

<h2>2. Notre Dame Fighting Irish</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589465" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589465" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Notre-Dame-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x436.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> The Notre Dame Fighting Irish know how to win | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wins</span>: 896

With an <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/notre-dame/2014.html" target="_blank">8-5 record in 2014</a>, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish managed to leapfrog Texas for the <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2015/fbs.pdf" target="_blank">No. 2 spot</a> on college football’s all-time winningest list. Thanks to another impressive season in 2015, the Irish were able to pad their lead over the lowly Longhorns. Brian Kelly and company finished the season with a 10-3 record, increasing the school's win total from 882 to 892. Unfortunately, the Irish have not done themselves any favors in 2016.

After beginning the year as the No. 10 ranked team in the country, things have quickly begun to fall apart for Notre Dame. Entering Week 13, the Irish are 4-7 and have completely fallen out of the AP rankings. Although the program's total wins have increased (now 894), for a team that began 2016 with such promise, it's now hard to imagine the season ending in anything but disappointment.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Wins</span>: 934

With Jim Harbaugh at the helm, Michigan Wolverines is once again a relevant college football team. This group <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/michigan/2015.html">finished the 2015 season with a 10-3 record</a>, increased the school's overall win total to an impressive <a href="http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2016/fbs.pdf">925 victories</a>, and maintained its position at the top of the list of all-time winning FBS teams. In 2016, things have only gotten better for the Wolverines.

After entering the 2016 season as the No. 7-ranked team in the preseason AP poll, the Wolverines won their first six games of the year (they currently sit at 10-1), have risen to the No. 3 spot in the latest rankings, and appear ready to make a run at a national championship. It's safe to say things are looking up in Ann Arbor.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_820006" align="aligncenter" width="801"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Big-12-Conference_Brandon-Wade_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-820006 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Big-12-Conference_Brandon-Wade_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brandon Wade/Getty Images" width="801" height="548" /></a> The Big 12 conference has officially voted in favor of expansion. | Brandon Wade/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-valuable-conferences-in-college-sports.html/" target="_blank">Big 12 Conference</a> has finally reached a verdict on whether or not to expand to become a 12 or 14 team conference. Back in July, the current presidents from every Big 12 institution met and unanimously voted in favor of expansion. This decision will not only bring a conference championship game back into the mix for football – something that would have been <a title="Big 12 is at a Disadvantage " href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12789694/big-12-likely-add-championship-game-commissioner-bob-bowlsby-says" target="_blank">incredibly valuable</a> to the league this past season — but it will also put the Big 12 on the same level in terms of marketability as the other four Power 5 conferences around the country. Their other option was to stay put as a 10-team league with minimal geographical reach. Five years ago, it would have been a no-brainer decision to stay with the traditional conference configuration. But in today’s college football landscape, the choice is equally as easy, but with a completely different outcome. The harsh reality of the matter is that the Big 12 had to either expand, or run the risk of disappearing.

As Jake Trotter of ESPN <a title="Big 12 expansion is not just a possibility, but an inevitability" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/100511/big-12-expansion-no-longer-an-if-but-rather-a-when" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, as we near the end of the current College Football Playoff contract and the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/richest-athletic-departments-college-sports.html/" target="_blank">Big 12’s current television contract</a>, it would become increasingly easier with every passing year for rival conferences to swoop in and poach teams from the Big 12 in their efforts to form even larger super-conferences. And let’s be honest, only a fool would believe that there is a conference that would scoff at the thought of adding Texas or Oklahoma to their league. And if that weren’t enough to motivate the Big 12 to consider expanding, there is also a <a title="Carlton: Boren’s comments provide better understanding of Big 12′s expansion math" href="http://collegesportsblog.dallasnews.com/2015/06/carlton-borens-comments-provide-better-understanding-of-big-12s-expansion-math.html/" target="_blank">pro-rata clause</a> in the league’s current television contract that will protect it’s member institutions from losing a portion of their revenue share to new members, which was a major concern in past expansion discussions.

Now that the Big 12 is <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/17108512/big-12-begin-exploring-expansion-candidates" target="_blank">officially preparing for expansion</a>, we decided to put together a list of potential schools that would be a good fit. In compiling this list, we considered factors such as athletic success, academics, geographic locations, facilities, fan bases, and television markets. With that being said, here is a look at the eight schools that we believe are the most-deserving of an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference.

<h2>1. Brigham Young University</h2>
[caption id="attachment_819988" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BYU-Cougars_George-Frey_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819988 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BYU-Cougars_George-Frey_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="George Frey/Getty Images" width="757" height="516" /></a> BYU and their national following has to be very attractive to the Big 12. | George Frey/Getty Images[/caption]

BYU is currently playing football as an independent (no conference affiliation), and they play basketball as a member of the West Coast Conference. Not only do the Cougars have strong programs in the revenue-producing sports of football and basketball, but they also have one of the strongest national followings in all of college athletics. The geographical location of BYU’s campus could cause a bit of snag, but the fact that their fan base is loyal and willing to travel bodes well for their chances of landing an invite to join the Big 12. With that being said, the administration at BYU may be perfectly content staying independent and having the ability to schedule any team they please on a yearly basis.

<h2>2.  University of Houston</h2>
[caption id="attachment_819991" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Houston-Cougars_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819991 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Houston-Cougars_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="488" /></a> The University of Houston looks like a great fit for the Big 12. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The biggest factor in support of the Cougars is the fact that the UH campus is located right in the heart of Big 12 country. Their football program has also enjoyed a decent amount of success over the last decade. They did, after all, serve as stepping stone jobs for Baylor head coach Art Briles and Texas A&amp;M head coach Kevin Sumlin during that time.

In 2015, they posted a 13-1 overall record, which included a win over Florida State in the Peach Bowl, in head coach Tom Herman's first year on the job. And as a result, things look incredibly promising for the Cougars' football program going forward.

Both the men’s and women’s basketball programs could be better, but the concept of adding another team from a major market in Texas may be too great for the Big 12 to pass up.

<h2>3.  Colorado State University</h2>
[caption id="attachment_819995" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Colorado-State-Rams_Doug-Pensinger_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819995 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Colorado-State-Rams_Doug-Pensinger_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Colorado State University would be a great fit to join the Big 12 conference. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Colorado State has quietly been home to one of the most successful athletic departments in the country over the last few years. Their football program has posted three-straight bowl game appearances, and has had four players selected in the third round or higher of the NFL Draft over the last three years. Their men’s basketball team has won 20 or more games in three of the last five seasons, and has two NCAA Tournament appearances over that stretch. Likewise, their women’s hoops team has developed into a perennial conference title contender, and the Rams also have one of the premier women’s volleyball programs in the entire country. That said, the biggest draws to CSU for the Big 12 are likely their geographical location, facilities – they are set to break ground on a <a title="Colorado State Football Stadium Renderings" href="http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2015/04/27/colorado-state-campus-stadium-renderings/26465821/" target="_blank">new $200 million football stadium</a> this fall — and their ties to the Denver television market. It is worth pointing out, however, that CSU has a less than stellar attendance record. If they performed better in that regard, the Rams would be a slam-dunk choice to receive an invitation to join the Big 12.

<h2>4.  Boise State University</h2>
[caption id="attachment_819999" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Boise-State-Broncos_Otto-Kitsinger-III_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-819999 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Boise-State-Broncos_Otto-Kitsinger-III_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Otto Kitsinger III/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Boise State would offer dominant football and basketball programs to the Big 12.| Otto Kitsinger III/Getty Images[/caption]

It wasn’t long ago that Boise State was known for nothing more than being the school with the blue football field. They were playing football at the Division I-AA level, and their basketball programs struggled to consistently compete within their own conference. That all seems like a distant memory at this point. Since the 1999 season, their football team has won 10 or more games 13 times, and has made bowl game appearances in 14 consecutive years. Additionally, their men’s basketball team has won 20 or more games in each of the last four seasons, and earned NCAA Tournament bids in 2013 and 2015. Unfortunately for the Broncos, the Big 12’s decision won’t be based solely on athletic performance. Boise, Idaho isn’t exactly an attractive geographical location, and their television market doesn’t really fit the mold for being in a Power 5 conference. Nevertheless, the allure of adding another premier football program to the league may bode well for Boise State’s chances of landing a Big 12 invite.

<h2>5.  University of Central Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_820001" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/University-of-Central-Florida_Jennifer-Stewart_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-820001 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/University-of-Central-Florida_Jennifer-Stewart_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /></a> The University of Central Florida has to look very appealing to the Big 12. |Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

If the Big 12 is looking to expand towards the east coast and into Florida, expect to see UCF land a conference invitation. Their football program already fits the bill, and their men’s and women’s basketball programs are trending upwards. More importantly, though, the addition of the Golden Knights would give the conference a presence in the state of Florida, which is one of the biggest football and basketball recruiting hotbeds in the country. On top of that, UCF is located in the heart of Orlando, one of the biggest television markets in the southeastern part of the country. Don’t be surprised if UCF is a member of the Big 12 at some point within the next two or three years.

<h2>6.  University of Cincinnati</h2>
[caption id="attachment_820215" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cincinnati-Bearcats_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-820215 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cincinnati-Bearcats_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joe Robbins/Getty Images" width="758" height="505" /></a> The University of Cincinnati looks like a great fit for the Big 12. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Cincinnati may make more sense for the Big 12 than any other school on this list. The Bearcats have almost everything in place from strong athletics, facilities, academics, and a large television market, to make a seamless transition into a Power 5 conference. On top of that, their Athletic Director, Mike Bohn, has ties to the Big 12 dating back to his time at the University of Colorado, and he also happens to know a thing or two about conference realignment. There is also the very real possibility that if things go well for Cincinnati over the next couple of years that more than one Power 5 conference could come calling.

<h2>7. University of Memphis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671357" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671357" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Memphis_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Memphis Tigers have a strong case to land an invitation to join the Big 12. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes down to it, Memphis has a strong case for inclusion whenever the time comes for the Big 12 to extend invitations to join their conference. They have a borderline national powerhouse men’s basketball program, and their football team has won 19 games in the last two seasons (they did just lose head coach Justin Fuente to Virginia Tech, however). And perhaps the Tigers’ biggest advantage is <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/15833061/big-businesses-helping-big-12-expansion-candidates" target="_blank">the fact that they have FedEx</a>, who is a potential big-money sponsor for the Big 12, in their corner.

On the flip side, the Memphis television market isn’t very appealing, and their two men’s revenue producing programs – football and basketball – don’t have a great track record when it comes to NCAA compliance. Still, the Tigers are a team that we believe has an excellent shot at landing an invite to join the Big 12 in the very near future.

<h2>8. University of Connecticut</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/UConn-Basketball_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="UConn Women's Basketball." width="757" height="526" /> The UConn basketball programs may be too good for the Big 12 to pass up. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

With all due respect to their football program, which has six bowl game appearances since 2004, it’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-talking-the-tourney-with-former-uconn-coach-jim-calhoun.html/" target="_blank">UConn’s men’s and women’s basketball programs</a> that are the draw for the Big 12. They have combined to win 15 national championships (11 for the woman and four for the men), and both programs offer one of the most recognizable national brands in the sport.

On top of their outstanding hoops programs, UConn offers a close proximity to several major east coast cities, specifically New York City. This factor could ultimately be seen as a negative by the Texas-based conference, but our guess is that the <a href="http://www.courant.com/sports/college/hc-big-12-expansion-0720-20160719-story.html" target="_blank">opportunities in the nation’s largest television market</a> would be too much to pass up.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Looking for the upset pick in your bracket that will make you look like a college basketball expert? Here are 5 matchups that fit the bill.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_955812" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-955812" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Domantas-Sabonis-WCC-Basketball-Tournament-Zl-6cR3KPmQl-640x400.jpg" alt="Ethan Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="473" /> Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The wait is over. Finally, after <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-which-conference-will-send-the-most-teams.html/" target="_blank">months of speculation</a> and predictions, the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/tournament/bracket" target="_blank">2016 Men&#8217;s NCAA Tournament</a> field is set in stone, signaling the official beginning of &#8220;March Madness." For millions of people, the next few days will almost certainly be spent less on work and more on prepping their sacred brackets to perfection. Of course, a bracket can never be perfect with out figuring out which first round matchups will produce <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/march-madness-5-biggest-first-round-upsets-ever.html/" target="_blank">unforgettable upsets</a>.</p>
<p>Picking that sure-fire upset, however, is usually anything but easy, so we have five round of 64 contests for you that are the safest bets to produce a lower seeded victory. These are ranked in order of most likely to least likely upset, but for all we know, each of these five &#8220;underdogs" will bust brackets left and right.</p>
<h2>1. No. 11 Gonzaga over No. 6 Seton Hall</h2>
<p>The Gonzaga Bulldogs are as consistent a basketball team as you&#8217;ll find across the country, as their selection into this year&#8217;s tourney marks 18 years in a row that they&#8217;ve earned a berth, keeping alive the <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2015-12-28/college-basketball-longest-active-ncaa-tournament-streaks" target="_blank">fourth longest active streak</a> in the nation. While this season was less certain than usual for the boys in Spokane, Mark Few&#8217;s club showed resilience in winning the West Coast Conference tournament, and now that they&#8217;re in the field nobody wants to play the Bulldogs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an upstart Seton Hall team out of the Big East earned the draw with Gonzaga. The Pirates impressed many by winning the Big East Tournament over Villanova and Xavier, making them a trendy pick to make a Sweet 16 run at the very least. They have terrific talent on the court,and their team, led by Isaiah Whitehead, has proven they can beat <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2550/seton-hall-pirates" target="_blank">just about anybody</a>,  but the Pirates have their hands full in their <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/seton-hall/" target="_blank">first tournament appearance since 2006</a>.</p>
<p>Gonzaga&#8217;s experience, led by Kyle Wiltjer, gives them an edge. So to does the hunger to prove to people that they are still the same Bulldogs that went all the way to the <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400787701" target="_blank">Elite 8</a> last season. Look for them to challenge for a Sweet 16 berth in the Midwest region.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. No. 11 Wichita State over No. 6 Arizona</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_776260" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-776260 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fred-VanVleet-Wichita-State-e1427073138547.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Arizona Wildcats have a strong team that finished fourth in a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/conferences/standings/_/id/21/year/2016/pac-12-conference" target="_blank">loaded Pac-12 conference</a>, and they&#8217;re also a school that has been on the verge of reaching each of the past two Final Fours (<a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/arizona/" target="_blank">if it wasn&#8217;t for Wisconsin</a>). Overall, Arizona has a strong basketball tradition that usually earns them some respect. Seeing where the selection committee for this year&#8217;s tournament placed them, it&#8217;s clear that the Wildcats got anything but respect. A low seed &#8212; for them &#8212; at No. 6 in the South region has Arizona in potential danger of failing to even win one game in the Big Dance.</p>
<p>Why are the Wildcats in trouble? Well, because they are likely to be matched up with another team that also received no love in terms of seeding on Selection Sunday &#8212; the Wichita State Shockers. A team with experienced players with a <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/wichita-state/" target="_blank">Final Four run</a> under their belt in Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker, the Shockers were expected to be higher than an 11-seed despite failing to win their conference tournament in the Missouri Valley. That&#8217;s what they got, though, and they&#8217;ll have to play an extra game (<a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/conversation?gameId=400871274" target="_blank">against Vanderbilt</a>) to even advance for a shot at the Wildcats. We think they&#8217;ll get there and &#8220;shock" anyone who thinks Arizona is a Final Four contender.</p>
<h2>3. No. 11 Northern Iowa over No. 6 Texas</h2>
<p>The Texas Longhorns have done great things under first year head coach Shaka Smart. They weren&#8217;t supposed to be anywhere near a 6-seed in the NCAA Tournament in a transitional year, but Smart pushed all the right buttons to lead the Longhorns to a fourth place finish in a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/conferences/standings/_/id/8/year/2016/big-12-conference" target="_blank">loaded Big 12</a>. However, with the surprise year in Austin brings surprise expectations along with it. That sets them up as a prime candidate to get knocked out in their first tourney game.</p>
<p>Texas&#8217;s opponent will be Northern Iowa, a team that had to get hot and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400870178" target="_blank">win the Missouri Valley Conference tournament</a> just to get an invite to the dance. Now that their here though, the Panthers have a chance to make serious waves. Need proof? For starters, they&#8217;ve been playing terrific basketball of late as winners of 12 of their past 13 games (including two wins over Wichita State). More importantly though, Northern Iowa proved it can knock off the top teams in the country when they <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400817213" target="_blank">beat North Carolina</a> early in the season.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. No. 12 Yale over No. 5 Baylor</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_955814" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-955814" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Justin-Sears-Yale-v-Duke-ofyK_en7-VZl-640x480.jpg" alt="Grant Halverson/Getty Images" width="757" height="568" /> Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Baylor is no stranger to the first round upset. Just last season, a highly rated Bears&#8217; team <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=400785450" target="_blank">fell at the hands of Georgia State</a> &#8212; a team that has only made three tournament appearances in their history. That loss has to be on Baylor&#8217;s mind entering this year&#8217;s tourney, which should allow them to avoid another stunning defeat. However, the team that they are matched up with in their 5 vs. 12 first round game is &#8212; like Georgia State &#8212; looking for one of its biggest wins in their program&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/yale/" target="_blank">Yale Bulldogs</a> haven&#8217;t been to the NCAA Tournament since the 1961-62 season and have never earned a victory in the Big Dance in their 121 season history. Yet, as a team that went 22-6 and won the Ivy League, there might not be a more perfect recipe for a first round upset (look at what <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/harvard/" target="_blank">Harvard did</a> out of the Ivy League in recent seasons). 12-seeds always win games in the tournament, and maybe it&#8217;s just something about the Big 12, but Baylor should be very worried about their tournament run ending early against Yale.</p>
<h2>5. No. 13 Stony Brook over No. 4 Kentucky</h2>
<p>When you have a player that can put up big numbers, your team usually has somewhat of a chance to win. That&#8217;s the case for the Stony Brook Seawolves, who earned their <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/stony-brook/" target="_blank">first NCAA Tournament appearance</a> by winning the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400870543" target="_blank">America East Conference tournament</a>. Their top player is Jameel Warney, who was spectacular all season long but took his game to another level in the Seawolves&#8217; conference championship clincher. Warney put up 43 points and 10 rebounds in that one, proving that he can take over a game and carry a team on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Stony Brook will have as difficult a matchup as anyone in the round of 64. They drew Kentucky in round one, which should overwhelm them. At least, that&#8217;s what should happen. The Wildcats are led by the great coaching of John Calipari and the talents of Tyler Ulis and Jamal Murray, among other pieces. Even in a down year by their strict standards (they still won the <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400871116" target="_blank">SEC tournament</a>), Kentucky still has enough to make a Final Four run. However, they could also lose to a team with nothing to lose in their first game if they aren&#8217;t careful.</p>
<p>Warney has enough talent to carry Stony Brook to a stunning victory over a powerhouse team, plain and simple. Seeing the way this season has gone across the nation and with how crazy the Big Dance gets, why would expect anything less?</p>

There are multiple scenarios that can cause a player to slip through the cracks and go undrafted. At the running back position, it can be anything from a lack of college game film, to fumbling issues, or even size concerns. It is also not uncommon <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-highest-paid-nfl-running-backs-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">for running backs to be more successful in the NFL than they were in college</a> due to differences in schemes and coaching philosophies. With the way running backs are being devalued in today’s NFL game, it is highly likely that there will be several undrafted running backs that will go on to have highly successful NFL careers in the coming years. With that, here is a look at the top five undrafted running backs in NFL history.
<h2>5.  Fred Jackson</h2>
<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
	<li>1,305 carries</li>
	<li>5,746 rushing yards</li>
	<li>30 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>4.4 yards per carry</li>
	<li>354 receptions</li>
	<li>2,897 receiving yards</li>
	<li>9 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Jackson’s road to the NFL was long and winding. After a massively successful college career at Division-III Coe College, Jackson received NFL tryouts, but was never offered a contract. His next move was to keep his professional football dream alive in the United Indoor Football League, a league that paid Jackson $200 a week. After two successful seasons in the UIFL, Jackson was signed by the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, where he showed enough to earn his first NFL contract from the Buffalo Bills. He has since rewarded Buffalo with eight consistently productive seasons led by his 2009 campaign in which he led the league in all-purpose yardage and became the only player in league history to have over 1,000 total rushing yards and 1,000 kickoff return yards in a single season. Jackson signed with Seattle after 8 years in upstate New York, and played in every game over the 2015 season.

<h2>4.  Marion Motley, University of Nevada</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756" class=" "]<img class="wp-image-730401 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cleveland.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="756" height="475" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
	<li>828 carries</li>
	<li>4,720 rushing yards</li>
	<li>31 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>5.7 yards per carry</li>
	<li>85 receptions</li>
	<li>1,107 receiving yards</li>
	<li>13 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Motley was a star at the University of Nevada before enrolling in the U.S. Navy. He played for a military team, coached by Paul Brown, while he was in the service and when Brown went on to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, he invited Motley to come and try out. Motely made the team and became one of the first African-Americans to play modern-era professional football. He went on to be a part of four Cleveland Browns’ championship teams and also owns the highest career yard per attempt average in NFL history (5.7). He also won two league rushing titles, was selected to one Pro Bowl, was a member of the NFL’s 1940s All-Decade team and the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time team and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.

<h2>3.  Arian Foster, University of Tennessee</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757" class=" "]<img class="wp-image-708841 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Arian-Foster-640x412.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="487" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
	<li>1,418 carries</li>
	<li>6,360 rushing yards</li>
	<li>53 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>4.5 yards per carry</li>
	<li>239 receptions</li>
	<li>2,143 receiving yards</li>
	<li>12 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Foster had a quirky college career that led to him going undrafted out of Tennessee in 2009. There were times in college that Foster looked like a potential early-round draft pick, and there were other times where he was forced to watch the Volunteers play from the sidelines. He finished his career as the second-leading rusher in Tennessee history, but fumbling issues and off-field problems tarnished his Volunteer legacy.

Foster was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Houston Texans where he spent most of his first season going back and forth from the practice squad and active roster. He made the first start of his career in the Texans’ final game of the 2009 season where he posted the first 100-yard game of his career, and has been the team’s starter ever since. Foster owns nearly every rushing record in Texans’ franchise history and has been named to three All-Pro teams, three Pro Bowl rosters and won the league rushing title in 2010.

<h2>2.  Joe Perry, Compton Junior College</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757" class=" "]<img class="wp-image-730403 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/49ers-Helmet.jpg" alt=" Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images" width="757" height="517" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
	<li>1,929 carries</li>
	<li>9,723 rushing yards</li>
	<li>71 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>5.0 yards per carry</li>
	<li>260 receptions</li>
	<li>2,021 receiving yards</li>
	<li>12 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Perry went undrafted out of Compton Junior College and went on to play 16 seasons in the NFL, mostly for the San Francisco 49ers. Perry is one of the few players in league history to have played in three decades – the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s – and was known for his blazing speed, which earned him the nickname The Jet. He was a member of the 49ers’ famed Million Dollar Backfield, and when Perry retired, he held the record for most rushing yards in a career, which has since been broken by multiple players. He was the first running back in league history to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, and finished his career with three Pro Bowl selections, three All-Pro selections, three rushing titles (1949, 1953 and 1954), and one NFL MVP award. He was selected to the NFL 1950s All-Decade team and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>1.  Priest Holmes, University of Texas</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756" class=" "]<img class="wp-image-730405 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Priest-Holmes.jpg" alt="Rick Stewart/Getty Images" width="756" height="506" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
	<li>1,780 carries</li>
	<li>8,172 rushing yards</li>
	<li>86 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>4.6 yards per carry</li>
	<li>339 receptions</li>
	<li>2,962 receiving yards</li>
	<li>8 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Holmes went undrafted out of Texas after spending the bulk of his career backing up one of the best running backs in college football history in Heisman Trophy-winner Ricky Williams. Holmes signed with the Baltimore Ravens in 1997 where he made the team as a rookie. He was named the starter for the Ravens in his second season, and went on to win a Super Bowl title with Baltimore before signing with the Kansas City Chiefs as a free agent in 2001. In his first three years in Kansas City, Holmes was the best running back in the NFL amassing a combined 4,590 yards and 56 touchdowns rushing, and 1,976 yards and five touchdowns receiving. Holmes finished his career with three Pro Bowl selections, three All-Pro selections, one league rushing title (2001), and one NFL Offensive Player of the Year award.

Major college football is a billion dollar business. Anyone doubting that statement can look at the attendance figures for Football Bowl Subdivision teams across the country and have their doubts erased. <a title="College Football Attendance Data" href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/writer/jon-solomon/24891415/college-football-attendance-home-crowds-drop-to-lowest-in-14-years" target="_blank">CBS Sports compiled</a> the attendance data for all 128 FBS teams in 2014 and found that the average attendance for a FBS game in 2014 was 43,483. While this was the lowest average since the 2000 season, when you think about games are played in a college football season, the total number of people to attend a college football game in 2014 is well into 10-figures. Here is a look at the top 10 schools in terms of average attendance per home game in 2014.

		<description><![CDATA[While you can make a good living coaching in college athletics, some jobs pay better than others. Which sports come with the biggest salaries for head coaches?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_745579" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="wp-image-745579 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cardale-jones-touchdown-ohio-state.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="758" height="505" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

In case you weren’t aware, there is a lot of money in college athletics. And as shown in the NCAA’s Division I Revenue and Expenses Report, it comes from all over the place.

While you are more than welcome to peruse the entire 2014 edition <a href="http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/D1REVEXP2013.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, there is one major piece of information that stuck out to us as we were examining this latest report. And that’s the median salaries received by head coaches as it pertains to the sport they oversee. Quite frankly, we found the numbers a little alarming — and somewhat disparaging. Especially when you start to compare the difference one receives for coaching a men’s team as opposed to a women’s.

Regardless, one thing is certain: It most definitely pays to be a collegiate head coach. So with an emphasis on the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), these are the 10 highest paid coaching positions in college sports.

<h2>10. Men’s Volleyball</h2>
Median salary: $151,000

If you’ve ever watched volleyball or played it for that matter, then you already know how challenging this game can be. And <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/volleyball-men/nc" target="_blank">Men’s College Volleyball</a> is no joke. These are some big dudes, who jump high and spike hard. There is a lot of strategy that goes into this sport, and thus the high salary.

Interestingly enough, we’re way more familiar with Women’s College Volleyball, which probably has something to do with <a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/339320/2014/12/21/athletics/penn-state-womens-volleyball-team-wins-seventh-ncaa-title" target="_blank">Penn State’s domination of the sport</a>. And yet, the pay for a head coach on the women’s side is less, at $145,000 a year.

<h2>9. Men’s Soccer</h2>
Median salary: $157,000

Playing soccer in college may not be the same as competing in the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html" target="_blank">English Premier League</a>, but coaches on the men’s side are compensated pretty well for their efforts. This year’s D-I <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/soccer-men/d1" target="_blank">men’s title went to the Virginia Cavaliers</a>, and we wouldn’t be surprised if their head coach, <a href="http://www.virginiasports.com/sports/m-soccer/mtt/gelnovatch_george00.html" target="_blank">George Gelnovatch</a>, made more than the current median. But just like everything else in sports: you win, you get paid.

<h2>8. Men’s Water Polo</h2>
Median salary: $162,000

We don’t know much about what goes into the sport of water polo, except that it requires insane lower body strength, the ability to hold off your defender, and a rifle arm with some killer accuracy. However, it would appear that you can make some nice coin coaching a <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/waterpolo-men" target="_blank">college men’s program</a>. And we expect the UCLA Bruins’ head coaching job is a <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/news/waterpolo-men/article/2014-12-07/marshall-scores-final-minute-lift-ucla-national-championship" target="_blank">coveted position</a>.

<h2>7. Women’s Ice Hockey</h2>
Median salary: $164,000

The seventh slot in the overall highest paid list finally belongs to the coaches of a collegiate women’s sport. Would you have guessed that it would go to the head coaches in <a href="http://www.uscho.com/d1women/" target="_blank">women’s D-I hockey</a>? We didn’t see that one coming either. Unfortunately, it’s not even close to what you’d get if you were running a men’s team (more on that later).

<h2>6. Baseball</h2>
Median salary: $218,000

No matter what goes down, baseball will always be <a href="http://www.uscho.com/d1women/" target="_blank">America’s favorite pastime</a>. And while some players will go straight to the minor leagues out of high school, there are still plenty who will make a pitstop in the college ranks. So for that reason, if you’re managing a <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/sports/baseball/d1" target="_blank">D-I college program</a>, you can expect to get a nice check. Not to mention, the <a href="http://www.cwsomaha.com/" target="_blank">College World Series</a> is a crazy roller coaster ride. It takes a smart person to navigate that path.

<h2>5. Men’s Lacrosse</h2>
Median salary: $222,000

For those of you who are unaware, men’s college lacrosse is awesome to watch. The game is very quick and often played with a fast pace. There is also a lot of tradition that comes with the sport, and it is very popular in private institutions. And more often than not, private means money.

<h2> 4. Men’s Ice Hockey</h2>
Median salary: $373,000

We mentioned earlier that it paid to be the coach at a Division I men’s ice hockey program, and we weren’t messing around. The median salary is more than twice the amount one would receive if they opted to coach the ladies. But we’d have to assume it’s because men’s hockey has been <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/history/icehockey-men/d1" target="_blank">crowning champions since 1948</a>. In the end, it pays to get to the <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/championships/icehockey-men/d1" target="_blank">Frozen Four</a>.

<h2>3. Women’s Basketball</h2>
Median salary: $374,000

If you’re looking to make money coaching a women’s collegiate program, then you better perfect your basketball knowledge. We’re not saying that you could be the next coach of the Connecticut Huskies; after all, they’re pretty set with <a href="http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/mtt/auriemma_geno00.html" target="_blank">Gino Auriemma</a>. But the sport of women’s basketball is always on the lookout for upcoming talent. If you’d like an example, look no further than <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaab-the-dagger/tyler-summitt-hired-to-be-new-louisiana-tech-women-s-basketball-coach-at-age-23-221650635.html" target="_blank">Tyler Summitt</a>. It appears the apple doesn’t fall far from the (coaching) tree.

<h2>2. Men’s Basketball</h2>
Median salary: $1,201,000

Men’s college basketball is one of the most popular sports out there. There are storied traditions, intense rivalries, and immense amounts of pride. Not to mention that the future stars of the NBA are funneled through these programs. If you’re coaching men’s Division I basketball, then you are looking at a very high-profile gig. We also can’t forget about the awesomeness that comes with <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/10-famous-college-basketball-fans-excited-for-march-madness.html/" target="_blank">March Madness</a>. We’re so close to the dance, we’re getting excited just thinking about it.

<h2> 1. Football</h2>
Median salary: $1,904,000

College football is king. It’s the sport that brings in the most money to the university, and it’s the one that has the most booster support. It is the breeding ground for the next great NFL talents, and we all know how much loot that industry makes. If you’re the coach of a major football program and you can maintain the school’s excellence, then you will be revered beyond your wildest dream. And if you can return a team to their past glory, then you’ll have <a href="http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2015/01/move_over_nick_saban_and_make.html" target="_blank">earned your place in history</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Michigan State overcame a 20 point deficit to beat Baylor in the Cotton Bowl. How does it stack up against the greatest comebacks in college football history?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_720163" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-720163 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MSU-Spartans.jpg" alt="Leon Halip/Getty Images" width="757" height="506" /> Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

Down 20 points heading into the fourth quarter against the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2014-team-offense.html" target="_blank">nation’s No. 1-ranked offense</a>, it was the No. 8 Michigan St. Spartans who turned into the offensive juggernaut as they rattled off 21 unanswered points to <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=400610179" target="_blank">stun</a> the No. 5 Baylor Bears.

In a battle of two of the country’s best teams, it appeared unfathomable that the Spartans would be able to topple the Bears, whose gunslinger, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/bryce-petty-1.html" target="_blank">Bryce Petty</a>, was having a monster day with 550 yards in the air and 3 touchdowns. However, it was Michigan St.’s <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/connor-cook-1.html" target="_blank">Connor Cook</a> who had the last laugh, firing a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/106814/spartans-avoid-knockout-blow-then-stun-baylor-42-41" target="_blank">go-ahead touchdown</a> pass with 17 seconds remaining in the ballgame. The 2015 Goodwill Cotton Bowl will certainly go down as an instant classic.

In honor of this historic game, we take a look, in ascending order, at 5 of the greatest comebacks in college football history.

<h2>5. Doug Flutie Does Damage</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682964 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Heisman-Trophy-Jeff-Zelevansky-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>Final score: Boston College 47, University of Miami (FL) 45</h4>
<a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/doug-flutie-1.html" target="_blank">Doug Flutie</a> might not have been the biggest guy on the field but, on November 23, 1984, the BC quarterback’s last-second Hail Mary touchdown to beat Miami pass might go down as arguably the greatest single-play in college football history.

Try watching this play and not getting chills. I dare you.

<h2>4. Kordell Stewart’s “Miracle at Michigan"</h2>
[caption id="attachment_701117" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-701117 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kordell-Stewart-David-Maxwell-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="David Maxwell/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="533" /> David Maxwell/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>Final score: Colorado 27, Michigan 26</h4>
It’s hard enough as it is to go into the Big House and take down the University of Michigan Wolverines. But, on September 24, 1994, Colorado quarterback, <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/kordell-stewart-1.html" target="_blank">Kordell Stewart</a>, upped the ante with his <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11578286/revisiting-miracle-michigan-20-years-later" target="_blank">64-yard Hail Mary</a> that won the Buffaloes the game, 27-26.

The Miracle at Michigan will always remain as one of the most iconic moments in college football lore.

<h2>3. Boise St. Brings the Trickery</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709918 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/95583199-640x431.jpg" alt="Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images" width="757" height="510" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>Final score: Boise St. 43, Oklahoma 42 (In Overtime)</h4>
A rising program looking to prove it belongs against a storied blue-blood. Gutsy and perfectly executed trick plays. A “Statue of Liberty" for a 2-point conversation and a double-overtime victory. Surprising proposal between a star running back and his cheerleader girlfriend. The ultimate storybook ending.

<h2>2. Johnny Football’s Swan Song</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687872" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687872 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/453825090-640x426.jpg" alt="Rob Carr/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>Final score: Texas A&amp;M 52, Duke 48</h4>
As Texas A&amp;M trailed the Duke Blue Devils, 38-17 at halftime, it looked as if <a href="http://www.12thman.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205236136" target="_blank">Johnny Manziel</a> was going to end his college career on a sour note. However, all this deficit did was set the stage for something special to be added to the legend that is Johnny Football. Manziel led a furious second-half comeback that would propel the Aggies to a victory in the <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=333650245" target="_blank">2013 Chick-fil-A Bowl</a>.

Johnny Manziel’s final numbers: 30-of-38, 382 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and 0 interceptions. Also, he added 73 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Not a bad way to go out.

<h2>1. Reich to the Rescue</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707629" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707629 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Frank-Reich-640x426.jpg" alt="Rick Stewart/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]
<h4>Final score: Maryland 42, Miami (FL) 40</h4>
Back-up quarterbacks aren’t meant to play. And they’re certainly not meant to come into a game, down 31-0 at halftime, and lead their team to victory. However, that’s exactly what <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/frank-reich-1.html" target="_blank">Frank Reich</a> did in the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/maryland-gets-a-miracle-in-miami" target="_blank">1984 Orange Bowl</a>. Reich threw six second-half touchdown passes and led the University of Maryland Terrapins to a stunning victory, in what is probably the greatest comeback in college football history.

Frank Reich would not be satisfied with merely accomplishing this feat at the college level, so he decided to do it again in the NFL. In the 1993 Playoffs, down 35-3, Reich came into the game and led the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/football/bills-oilers-game-in-1993-is-greatest-comeback-that-ever-was-and-was-not.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Buffalo Bills to a victory over the Houston Oilers</a>, 41-38. If you’re ever in the need for a comeback, this is definitely the guy to call.

		<description><![CDATA[Major college football has been crowning a national championship since 1869 when Yale was crowned the first national champion in college football history.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_712401" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-712401 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alabama-National-Champions.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="640" height="427" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

In the constantly evolving world of college football, it has become difficult to keep track of which schools are in which conferences. What’s even more difficult is tracking national championships through the years in the division that is now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision. Prior to the Bowl Championship Series, and now the College Football Playoff, there were numerous outlets that crowned national champions, which has convoluted college football’s history books.

Using only national championships that are recognized by the <a title="NCAA Football National Champions" href="http://www.ncaa.com/history/football/fbs" target="_blank">National Collegiate Athletics Association</a>, I compiled a list of the conferences with the most football national championships of all-time. It is important to note that the Ivy League no longer plays at the FBS level, but their national titles that are included were won when they were playing at college football’s highest level. Also, this list reflects <a title="NCAA Football Conference" href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/2/13/5404930/college-football-realignment-2014-conference-moves" target="_blank">current conference alignment</a> and some national championships may have been won when teams were members of other conferences.

So, which conference has the most national championships of all-time? Here is a look at the total number of football national championships won by each conference.

It feels like a distant memory now, but After nearly 16 minutes of a late November college basketball game between Savannah State and No. 6 Louisville, only one of the two teams <a href="http://www.gocards.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/112414aaa.html" target="_blank">had scored</a>. The Cardinals led 29-0 before Savannah State dented the scoreboard, eventually taking a 41-7 lead into the locker room at intermission and rolling to a lopsided 87-26 victory. Savannah State <a href="http://www.gocards.com/sports/m-baskbl/stats/2014-2015/game04.html" target="_blank">misfired on</a> 24 of its 26 field goal attempts before halftime, <a href="http://www.gocards.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/112414aae.html" target="_blank">and went</a> 0-16 behind the 3-point arc for the game.

The Tigers’ first-half futility sent us scrambling for the college basketball record books to see what other teams had struggled that mightily to put the ball in the basket over a half or — in some cases — an entire game. While this may not be an exhaustive list, here are 10 of the other ugliest offensive outputs since 1986, a year that seems to be a logical dividing point in history after college hoops instituted a shot clock and 3-point line to prevent scores like Duke 7, North Carolina 0 (halftime) in 1979.

Games are listed in chronological order.
<h2>1. Coastal Carolina vs. Georgia Southern, January 2, 1997</h2>
Coastal Carolina’s defense held Georgia Southern to a then-record low (for the shot-clock era) 21 points in a January 1997 blowout win at home. The Chanticleers led their visitors 31-11 at halftime and prevailed 61-21, with the Eagles only <a href="http://www.bbstate.com/games/1997-01-02/GS-CCU" target="_blank">able to convert</a> two of their 18 field goal attempts inside the 3-point line.
<h2>2. Rice vs. South Florida: November 30, 1997</h2>
USF and Rice played a first half to forget at the San Juan Shootout in November 1997. The Bulls and Owls scored eight points — combined (!) — in the opening 20 minutes of play, which represents the NCAA (post-1986) record for fewest points in a half between two teams. USF led 6-2 at the break, but both teams got the lids off of their baskets in the second half: The Bulls prevailed <a href="http://statsheet.com/mcb/games/1997/11/30/south-florida-49-rice-46" target="_blank">49-46</a>.
<h2>3. Monmouth vs. Princeton: December 14, 2005</h2>
The lowest-scoring total for both teams in a game since 1986 came in a <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=253480163" target="_blank">December 2005</a> clash between Monmouth and Princeton. The Hawks only scored 41 points in the game, but still remarkably won by 20. Final score: Monmouth 41, Princeton 21. Tigers coach Joe Scott summarized his team’s performance this way: “Obviously, we just couldn’t score…the ball wasn’t going in the basket.” We think that qualifies as an understatement.

<h2>4. Kansas State vs. Savannah State: January 7, 2008</h2>
Apparently, Monday wasn’t the first time the Savannah State basketball team has had such drastic problems putting up points: A <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/kansas-state/2008-schedule.html" target="_blank">2008 game</a> against Kansas State was nearly that bad. The Tigers were an abysmal 1-23 from the floor after halftime (or 4.3%), the worst 20-minute shooting percentage in NCAA history at the time. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/sports/ncaabasketball/09savannah.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Wildcats outscored</a> SSU 48-4 in the second frame, walking away with an 85-25 victory when the final horn sounded.
<h2>5. George Washington vs. Saint Louis: January 10, 2008</h2>
The current shot clock-era record for fewest points scored by one team in a game also came in January 2008 (apparently that was either a bad week for offense or a good week for defense?). The George Washington Colonials held Saint Louis to a ridiculously low 20 points in a 49-20 victory to open conference play. Bryce Husak came off the bench <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=280100045" target="_blank">to lead</a> the Billikens in scoring: He had five points.
<h2>6. Oklahoma vs. Texas A&amp;M: March 1, 2008</h2>
At first glance, the final score of this game doesn’t look historically bad: Oklahoma (pictured) beat Texas A&amp;M 64-37 in a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncb&amp;id=3272390" target="_blank">March 2008</a> Big 12 Conference game. However, the stats don’t tell the whole story. The Aggies were held scoreless for 16 minutes and eight seconds of game time, from midway through the first half until 16:42 remained in the contest, setting an NCAA record for the longest scoring drought ever.
<h2>7. California vs. Notre Dame, November 26, 2010</h2>
The California Golden Bears were undefeated heading into an Old Spice Classic semifinal date with Notre Dame, but that all came apart quickly. Cal was only able to muster <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/blog/the_dagger/post/Cal-s-brutal-five-point-half-among-the-worst-of-?urn=ncaab-289639" target="_blank">five points</a> (compared to the Fighting Irish’s 21) in the first half of an eventual 57-44 defeat. Of course, that wasn’t all that came apart that night at Disney: the tournament logo at center court <a href="http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30100&amp;ATCLID=207754716" target="_blank">also came unglued</a> and had to be taped down during the game. ‘Twas an ugly night all the way around, apparently.

<h2>8. Georgetown vs. Tennessee: November 30, 2012</h2>
The Tennessee Volunteers put the clamps on No. 20 Georgetown <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=323350046" target="_blank">in November 2012</a>, holding the Hoyas (pictured) to a paltry 37 points. Oh, and Tennessee <a href="http://deadspin.com/5964823/georgetown-and-tennessee-missed-the-record-for-lowest-scoring-game-of-the-shot-clock-era-by-just-four-points" target="_blank">still lost</a>. Georgetown’s Markel Starks hit a go-ahead shot with more than four minutes to play that put his team on top 37-36, a basket that also turned out to be the game-winner: Neither team would score again.
<h2>9. Dayton vs. Northern Illinois: December 1, 2012</h2>
The 2012-2013 Northern Illinois basketball team, which limped to a 5-25 record, had a hard time scoring points on a consistent basis. That was clearly evident in December 2012, when NIU only scored five points in the first half of a 60-43 loss at Dayton. The Huskies went more than 16 minutes without scoring a point in the process, falling to 1-5 on the season.
<h2><strong>10. Eastern Michigan vs. Northern Illinois: January 26, 2013
</strong></h2>
The 2012-2013 Northern Illinois basketball team, which limped to a 5-25 record, had a hard time scoring points on a consistent basis. That was clearly evident in January 2013 (deja vu, anyone?), when NIU only scored four points in the first half of a 42-25 loss <a href="http://www.niuhuskies.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/012613aab.html" target="_blank">at Eastern Michigan</a>. Northern Illinois shot a miserable 1-31 from the floor in the first half for a field goal percentage of 3.2%. A late second-half 3-pointer was NIU’s only make from behind the arc in 33 3-point attempts.
