				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_505309" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505309" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bucs-fans-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tampa Bay fans hold up a sign showing their draft day preference." width="757" height="503" /> The Tampa Bay faithful needed this one | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Football never really stops. That's true for the fans, and it's true for the teams. So you can imagine that all 32 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">National Football League</a> teams started preparing for the regular season long before the offseason officially started, and most of their efforts go into picking the right players in the draft.

Some players on current rosters will become free agents while others will retire, giving general managers and coaches an idea of what their teams' positions of need will be in the future. Scouts closely follow the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-quarterbacks-in-college-football-history.html/">careers of collegiate players</a> in hopes of finding the next Adrian Peterson, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/professional-athletes-walked-in-prime.html/">Calvin Johnson</a>, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a>.

Although drafting quality athletes with the right physical and mental tools to “make it” in the pros is always a big challenge, sports analysts do their best to project the most valuable college players who could likely become big stars. Sometimes, they’re right; other times, they completely miss the mark. Teams that covet their first-round pick often come away with a complete dud. Here are 11 of the biggest NFL draft busts in recent history.

<h2>11. Heath Shuler</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757739" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Heath-Shuler-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Heath Shuler looks for a target." width="757" height="505" /> Heath Shuler couldn't cut it in the NFL | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

With the No. 3 overall pick in the 1994 draft, the Washington Redskins selected Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler. Suffice to say, this pick did not work out as planned. During his brief time in Washington (three seasons to be exact), Shuler started just 13 games (played in 19 total), and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/ShulHe00.htm">went 4-9 as a starter</a>. He completed 47.7% of his passes, amassed only 2,403 total passing yards, and threw 13 touchdowns against 19 interceptions.

In 1997, the Redskins traded Shuler to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for a fifth-round pick that year and a third-round pick in 1998. If they could do it all over again, it's safe to say the 'Skins would go in a different direction.

<h2>10. Akili Smith</h2>
[caption id="attachment_648283" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-648283" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Akili-Smith_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images-631x500.jpg" alt="Akili Smith holds up his finger before a play." width="757" height="600" /> Akili Smith couldn't make it work in the NFL | Jonathan Daniel/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cincinnati Bengals took quarterback Akili Smith with the third overall pick in the 1999 draft. Over the next four seasons, the organization learned a valuable lesson: Success in college doesn't always translate to the NFL. Smith started only 17 games in Cincinnati, boasting an uninspiring 3-14 record. He threw for just 2,212 yards and five touchdowns -- compared to 13 interceptions --  as a Bengal, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SmitAk00.htm">completing a mere 46.6% of his passes</a> in the process. The 2002 season was his last in the NFL.

<h2>9. Rick Mirer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757746" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757746" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rick-Mirer-Al-Bello-Getty-Images-.jpg" alt="Rick Mirer grips the ball and makes a run for it." width="757" height="503" /> Rick Mirer couldn't get the job done in the NFL | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Thinking they had their quarterback of the future, the Seattle Seahawks took Notre Dame's Rick Mirer with the second overall pick in the 1993 draft. It's safe to say Mirer was no Joe Montana.

Prior to being traded to the Chicago Bears in 1997, Mirer spent four seasons in Seattle, where he compiled a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MireRi00.htm">20-31 record as a starter</a>, completed 53.4% of his passes, and threw for 9,094 yards, 41 touchdowns, and 56 interceptions. Although Mirer never lived up to the hype, he deserves some credit for carving out an eight-year playing career. That's better than most.

<h2>8. Trent Richardson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757751" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757751" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trent-Richardson-Alex-Trautwig-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Trent Richardson holds tight to the ball as he falls to the ground." width="757" height="553" /> Trent Richardson failed to live up to expectations | Alex Trautwig/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to the NFL draft, few teams <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nfl-teams-players-least-want-to-join-even-for-twice-the-pay.html/">make more mistakes</a> than the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-biggest-disappointmets-of-2016.html/">Cleveland Browns</a>. Selecting running back Trent Richardson with the No. 3 overall pick in 2012 is a perfect example of the franchise's ineptitude. Richardson lasted a little over two years in Cleveland, where he amassed 1,055 rushing yards -- and 11 rushing touchdowns -- and averaged 62.1 yards on the ground per game. He was traded to the Indianapolis Colts during the 2014 season, and hasn't stepped on an NFL field since the end of that year. Roll Tide?

<h2>7. Ki-Jana Carter</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757745" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757745" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ki-Jana-Carter-Doug-Pensinger-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ki-Jana Carter runs toward the end zone." width="757" height="512" /> Ki-Jana Carter did not work out for the Bengals | Doug Pensinger/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

If you ever wonder why teams hesitate to take running backs early in the draft, look no further than Ki-Jana Carter. Following an All-American campaign at Penn State, Carter was taken by the Bengals with the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1995/draft.htm">first overall pick in the 1995 draft</a>. His time in Cincinnati was short-lived, to say the least. Carter started just 14 games over the next four seasons, compiling 747 rushing yards and 16 rushing scores while <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CartKi00.htm">averaging an abysmal 21.3 yards per game</a>. Just think: The Bengals could've had Steve McNair, Warren Sapp, or Derrick Brooks. Ouch.

<h2><strong>6. Aaron Curry</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505314" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505314" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Aaron-Curry-Otto-Gruele-Jr.-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Curry tackles an Arizona Cardinal." width="757" height="504" /> Aaron Curry did not deliver for the Seahawks | Otto Gruele Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

In the 2009 draft, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-stadiums.html/">Seattle Seahawks</a> thought they had their dominant linebacker of the future in Aaron Curry. They took him fourth overall out of Wake Forest and paid him $34 million guaranteed, which is the most for a non-quarterback in NFL history. But only two years later, they traded him to the Oakland Raiders for a seventh-round pick in the 2012 draft.

After being waived by the Raiders, Curry signed a one-year deal with the New York Giants in 2013. They cut him in training camp, and he decided to retire from professional football altogether in August of that year.

<h2><strong>5. Tim Couch</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505320" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505320" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tim-Couch-David-Maxwell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Couch attempts to throw the ball before being tackled by a defender." width="757" height="587" /> Tim Couch was not the answer in Cleveland | David Maxwell/Getty Images[/caption]

With great success at the college level for the University of Kentucky, quarterback Tim Couch was the No. 1 overall selection for the Cleveland Browns in the 1999 NFL Draft. However, his five-year career was full of injuries; when he actually played, he was terribly inaccurate.

Couch finished with 64 touchdowns and an awful 67 interceptions. The Browns wound up releasing him after the 2003 season. He attempted a few comebacks, but they were all unsuccessful. In 2007, Couch solidified his failed attempt at an NFL career, testing positive for human growth hormone and steroids.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>4. Tony Mandarich</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505322" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505322" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tony-Mandarich-Mike-Powell-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tony Mandarich levels a San Diego Charger." width="757" height="516" /> The Green Bay Packers got it wrong with Tony Mandarich | Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

Billed as “The Incredible Bulk” because of his amazing college career at Michigan State, offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was projected to be a monster in the NFL. The Green Bay Packers took him as the No. 2 pick in the 1989 draft, but he never lived up to those expectations.

Though Mandarich held out for a big rookie contract <span class="s2">-- b</span>ecoming the first O-lineman to make a seven-figure salary per season <span class="s2">-- </span>he was a liability on the field and got burned by defenses on a weekly basis. His career with the Packers only lasted two seasons before he was cut. To make matters worse, he became addicted to painkillers and had to enter rehab. Mandarich actually returned to the NFL for a decent three-year stint with the Indianapolis Colts. However, he never became the dominant force he was supposed to be.

<h2><strong>3. Charles Rogers</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505324" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505324" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Charles-Rodgers-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Charles Rogers drops the ball as Bengals defenders catch up with him." width="757" height="604" /> Charles Rogers dropped the ball | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

During the tenure of former player Matt Millen as <span class="s1">P</span>resident and CEO of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-nfl-teams-that-have-choked-away-the-most-wins-in-nfl-history.html/">Detroit Lions</a> in the 2000s, there were many bad drafts. But one that sticks out in most peoples’ minds occurred in 2003, when the team picked Michigan State wide receiver Charles Rogers second overall.

Expectations were high after he won the Biletnikoff Award for being the country’s best WR. Sports writers even compared him to future Hall of Famers like Randy Moss. But in his first two seasons, Rogers broke his collarbone twice and only played six games. In 2005, the league suspended him following his third violation of the NFL’s drug policy. This led to his eventual outright release.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>2. JaMarcus Russell</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_473178" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-473178" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JaMarcus-Russell-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="JaMarcus Russell wakes off the field after a play." width="757" height="523" /> JaMarcus Russell was not the answer | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Al Davis, the late owner of the Oakland Raiders, was known for drafting some of the worst busts in recent history. Quarterback JaMarcus Russell could be the biggest. Between his unbelievable Sugar Bowl performance with the LSU Tigers and his ability to throw a football 70 yards from his knees, Russell had Davis convinced that he found his franchise QB. Boy, was he wrong.

Subsequent to becoming the first overall selection of the 2007 draft, Russell made it clear that he couldn’t be coached and was a lazy player. His career only lasted three seasons; he had 18 touchdowns, 23 interceptions, and 22 fumbles. After he left the game, Russell was arrested for possession of codeine, and he ballooned up to 308 pounds. He tried to make a comeback before the 2014 season, but was never signed by any team.

<h2><strong>1. Ryan Leaf</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_505328" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505328" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Ryan-Leaf-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ryan Leaf is tackled by an Atlanta Hawk." width="757" height="519" /> Picking Ryan Leaf was a bad idea | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

As one of the most coveted players coming out of college in 1998, Ryan Leaf seemed to be a future Hall of Famer. The San Diego Chargers agreed with the assessment, taking the Washington State quarterback second overall in the draft. But he just didn’t pan out from the start. Leaf’s passion for the game was always in question, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-worst-nfl-players-ever.html/">it showed on the field</a>.

In just a four-year span, he played for four different teams and finished with a horrible 14/36 TD-to-INT ratio and a QB rating of 50. Following his quick retirement, Leaf became a quarterback coach at West Texas A&amp;M University in 2006. Unfortunately, his life <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/football-players-ruined-nfl-careers.html/">spiraled out of control</a> with illegal drug issues and other brushes with the law. Most recently, Leaf served a seven-year sentence in state prison stemming from burglary and drug possession charges in Montana. He was released in 2014.

		<description><![CDATA[There have been a lot of mistakes by the lake since the Browns returned to the NFL.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[If one position has embodied the instability and struggles the Cleveland Browns have faced since their NFL return, it’s the quarterback spot. Since 1999, the famously doomed franchise has had an astounding number of players start at least one game at quarterback. For a point of reference, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-makes-history-ranking-all-his-super-bowl-appearances.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the number of New England Patriots starters</a> in the same period of time is five: Drew Bledsoe and his replacement in 2001, Tom Brady, followed by Matt Cassel, Jimmy Garoppolo, and Jacoby Brissett. The latter three only filled in for Brady when he was either injured or suspended.

Here is the exhaustive, complete list of Browns quarterbacks <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/cleveland-browns/team-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since their return to the league</a>. (Note: years listed indicate ones in which the player <i>started</i> games for the Browns. Not necessarily all their years with the team.)
<h2>1. Tim Couch, 1999-2003</h2>
[caption id="attachment_849833" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-849833" title="Tim Couch wasn't the answer in Cleveland." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tim-couch-kosar-JFF.jpg" alt="Getty Images" width="757" height="473" /> Tim Couch wasn't the answer in Cleveland. | Getty Images[/caption]

Tim Couch didn't start the very first game when the Browns returned to the NFL, but he was the future of the franchise on that day. Couch ended up with the Browns for five seasons, and then was out of the league before his 27th birthday. For his career, the Browns No. 1 overall pick back in 1999 recorded 64 touchdowns, 67 interceptions, and a 75.1 passer rating. In 2002, Couch led the team to its one and only playoff appearance since coming back to the NFL -- but was unable to play in the game due to injury.

<strong>Key stats: 59 starts, 64 TD, 67 INT, 75.1 rating</strong>
<h2>2. Ty Detmer, 1999</h2>
The quarterback that did start the opener in that 1999 season was Ty Detmer. In that game, Detmer was just 6-for-13 passing with an interception and 52 yards before Cleveland turned to Couch in the 43-0 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Detmer had been brought in primarily as a mentor to the young Couch, and he served that purpose. He threw four touchdowns, two picks, and a 75.7 passer rating in his only season with the team.

<strong>Key stats: 2 starts, 4 TD, 2 INT, 75.7 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> A Super Bowl winner.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Doug Pederson, 2000</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930646" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930646" title="Doug Pederson played one season in Cleveland." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-645551.jpg" alt="Doug Pederson played one season in Cleveland." width="757" height="513" /> Doug Pederson played one season in Cleveland. | Getty Images[/caption]

Before he was known as the head coach of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, Doug Pederson was an NFL quarterback. He spent most of his career in Green Bay as Brett Favre’s backup, but joined the Browns in 2000 and made eight starts. Pederson recorded seven touchdowns, nine interceptions, and a 62.9 passer rating that year in Cleveland and then promptly returned to Green Bay to spend four more years backing up Favre.

<strong>Key stats: 8 starts, 2 TD, 8 INT, 56.6 rating</strong>
<h2>4. Spergon Wynn, 2000</h2>
There isn't a whole lot of story to tell with Spergon Wynn. He went to collage at Texas St. and was a sixth-round draft choice of the Browns in 2000, just one year after they drafted Couch No. 1 overall. But Wynn started just one game (he appeared in seven total) in a Browns uniform that year, a 48-0 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was released after the season and made a brief appearance with the Minnesota Vikings before disappearing into obscurity.

<strong>Key stats: 1 start, 0 TD, 1 INT, 41.2 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next: </strong>The Browns' only playoff starter.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Kelly Holcomb, 2002-2004</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930648" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930648" title="Kelly Holcomb of the Cleveland Browns looks down in frustration." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-72305055.jpg" alt="Kelly Holcomb of the Cleveland Browns looks down in frustration." width="757" height="499" /> Kelly Holcomb of the Cleveland Browns looks down in frustration. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Kelly Holcomb actually joined the Browns in 2001, appearing in one game but making zero starts. He primarily served as Couch's backup during his time with the team, and actually started for the injured Couch in that one playoff game. Holcomb didn't play poorly, going 26-for-43 passing with 429 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception. His career regular season marks with the team include 26 touchdowns, 21 interceptions, and an 83.3 passer rating.

<strong>Key stats: 12 starts, 26 TD, 21 INT, 83.3 rating</strong>
<h2>6. Jeff Garcia, 2004</h2>
Former Pro Bowler Jeff Garcia was the highest profile player to come to the Browns ever back when he signed in 2004. Unfortunately, Garcia unable to lift the team from its extended doldrums. The 34-year-old recorded just 10 touchdowns, nine interceptions, and a 76.7 passer rating in his only season. But he wasn't exactly washed up. Garcia left and spent five more seasons in the NFL, including another trip to the Pro Bowl in 2007 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

<strong>Key stats: 10 starts, 10 TD, 9 INT, 76.7 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> One of the McCowns'.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Luke McCown, 2004</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930647" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930647" title="Quarterback Luke McCown of the Cleveland Browns is sacked by defensive end Chris Kelsay." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-52257662.jpg" alt="Quarterback Luke McCown of the Cleveland Browns is sacked by defensive end Chris Kelsay." width="757" height="529" /> Quarterback Luke McCown of the Cleveland Browns is sacked by defensive end Chris Kelsay. | Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

Luke isn't the only McCown on this list, but more on that later. He was a fourth-round draft pick of Cleveland back in 2004, and as a rookie he was able to make four starts with the team. McCown posted just four touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a 52.6 rating in that time. After briefly disappearing from the league, he did go on to have a decent NFL career. McCown played 10 years in the league as a backup quarterback before eventually retiring at the age of 34.

<strong>Key stats: 4 starts, 4 TD, 7 INT, 52.6 rating</strong>
<h2>8. Trent Dilfer, 2005</h2>
Trent Dilfer is a fun trivia question, as the starting quarterback who led the Baltimore Ravens to a Super Bowl victory in 2000. He joined the Browns near the end of his career, starting 11 games in 2005. Dilfer threw for 11 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and had a 76.9 passer rating to go along with a 4-7 record. He did not play at all the next season before wrapping up his career with the San Francisco 49ers in 2007.

<strong>Key stats: 11 starts, 11 TD, 12 INT, 76.9 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> A draft pick that fizzled out.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Charlie Frye, 2005-2007</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930651" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930651" title="Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Charlie Frye threw for 198 yards and won his first NFL game with the Cleveland Browns." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-116615695.jpg" alt="Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Charlie Frye threw for 198 yards and won his first NFL game with the Cleveland Browns." width="757" height="551" /> Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Charlie Frye threw for 198 yards and won his first NFL game with the Cleveland Browns. | Robert B. Stanton/NFLPhotoLibrary[/caption]

Charlie Frye was a third-round pick of the Browns in 2005, and you may be noticing a pattern by this point. The Browns drafted a lot of quarterbacks. Frye spent three years in Cleveland, totaling 19 starts. He ultimately compiled 14 touchdown passes, 23 picks, and a 71.1 rating with the team. Frye played two more years in the league as a backup before retiring at 28 years old in 2009.

<strong>Key stats: 19 starts, 14 TD, 23 INT, 71.1 rating</strong>
<h2>10. Derek Anderson, 2006-2009</h2>
Although he was a journeyman for the majority of his career, Derek Anderson had one very solid season for the Browns. The 2007 season was Anderson's first as the primary starter, and he finished the year with 29 touchdowns, 3,787 passing yards, and an 82.5 passer rating. He made the Pro Bowl and led Cleveland to a 10-6 record, although a tiebreaker cost them a chance at another trip to the playoffs. Like everyone that came before him, however, Anderson was not the long term solution for the Browns.

<strong>Key stats: 34 starts, 46 TD, 45 INT, 69.7 rating</strong>

<h2>11. Brady Quinn, 2008-2009</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930649" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-930649" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-83796110.jpg" alt="Brady Quinn didn't live up to the hype." width="757" height="489" /> Brady Quinn didn't live up to the hype. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

How could Cleveland lose with Brady Quinn? He seemed like a sure thing, an excellent quarterback coming out of an even better program at Notre Dame. The Browns took him with the No. 22 overall pick in 2007, and the results over his two-year stint as a starter were mostly underwhelming: 10 touchdowns, nine interceptions, and a 66.8 passer rating. The team was 3-9 in his 12 starts, and Quinn played his last NFL game in 2012.

<strong>Key stats: 12 starts, 10 TD, 9 INT, 66.8 rating</strong>
<h2>12. Ken Dorsey, 2008</h2>
Who can't forget Ken Dorsey? This journeyman came to Cleveland in 2006 with little experience, having started 10 NFL games in the previous two seasons with the 49ers. He didn't actually start a game until 2008, compiling zero touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a brutal 26.1 passer rating. That was bad enough that the former University of Miami star would never again appear in an NFL game.

<strong>Key stats: 3 starts, 0 TD, 7 INT, 26.1 rating</strong>

<h2>13. Bruce Gradkowski, 2008</h2>

Bruce Gradkowski is yet another journeyman quarterback to make a start for the Browns. He started 11 games as a rookie with the Buccaneers in 2006, and then just a total of nine starts the rest of his career. In his one season in Cleveland, Gradkowski made just one start (two appearances) in the last game of the year against the Steelers. He was 5-for-16 passing with 18 yards and two interceptions, so it's no wonder he didn't get another starting job after his showcase.

<strong>Key stats: 1 starts, 0 TD, 3 INT, 2.8 rating</strong>
<h2>14. Colt McCoy, 2010-2011</h2>
Colt McCoy was a third-round pick of the Browns in 2010 and ended up starting eight games as a rookie. He actually was the primary starter for the first two years of his career, but played his way out of the lineup by 2012. McCoy’s Cleveland career was one of constant battering behind a porous offensive line, making him the victim of 59 sacks in 24 total appearances. He had 21 touchdowns, 20 picks, and a 74.8 passer rating while there.

<strong>Key stats: 21 starts, 21 TD, 20 INT, 74.8 rating</strong>

<h2>15. Jake Delhomme, 2010</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930766" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930766" title="Jake Delhomme of the Cleveland Browns throws a first quarter pass." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-103698923.jpg" alt="Jake Delhomme of the Cleveland Browns throws a first quarter pass." width="757" height="574" /> Jake Delhomme of the Cleveland Browns throws a first quarter pass. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Jake Delhomme is better remembered for his time (and Super Bowl appearance) with the Carolina Panthers, but he did suit up for the Browns late in his career. Delhomme was a bit banged up by the time he rolled into Cleveland, and he ended up making just four starts, throwing two touchdowns and four interceptions. The 35-year-old made his way to the Houston Texans the following year, but he made no starts and just one appearance before retiring.

<strong>Key stats: 4 starts, 2 TD, 7 INT, 63.4 rating</strong>
<h2>16. Seneca Wallace, 2010-2011</h2>
Once the Seattle Seahawks had decided they were through with Seneca Wallace, the Cleveland Browns took a flyer on the 30-year-old. He played two uneventful seasons with the Browns, starting seven games and leading the team to a 1-6 record. It might be better to consult his receiving statistics, where Wallace was occasionally used effectively when split out wide. He caught two passes for 30 yards in his Browns career. As far as Wallace's passing numbers with the Browns, however, he was perfectly average: six touchdowns, four picks, and a 76.6 passer rating.

<strong>Key stats: 7 starts, 6 TD, 4 INT, 76.6 rating</strong>

<h2>17. Brandon Weeden, 2012-2013</h2>

Maybe the oldest true rookie of all time at the age of 29, the prospect of Brandon Weeden catching on as a starting NFL quarterback always seemed dubious. But the Browns drafted him with the No. 22 pick in the first round anyway, and Weeden ended up starting just 20 games over two seasons in Cleveland. He threw 23 touchdowns, 26 interceptions, and posted a 71.8 rating. Also, there was <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000262575/article/brandon-weedens-int-in-browns-loss-to-live-in-infamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this beauty</a>.

<strong>Key stats: 20 starts, 23 TD, 26 INT, 71.8 rating</strong>
<h2>18. Thad Lewis, 2012</h2>
Thad Lewis went undrafted and made his first appearance in the NFL at the age of 27, starting a game for the Browns in 2012. He actually didn't play that poorly in the game, recording a touchdown, a pick, 204 yards passing, and an 83.3 passer rating. That earned Lewis a chance to hang on with the Buffalo Bills the following year, when he made five starts. But that was pretty much it for Lewis' mostly-forgettable NFL career.

<strong>Key stats: 1 starts, 1 TD, 1 INT, 83.3 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> A backup that needed to start.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>19. Jason Campbell, 2013</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930652" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930652" title="Jason Campbell of the Cleveland Browns prepares to throw against the New England Patriots.

" width="757" height="552" /> Jason Campbell of the Cleveland Browns prepares to throw against the New England Patriots. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Jason Campbell was a solid quarterback in the NFL. He was good enough to be an unspectacular starter, or at the very least a great backup. He came to the Browns in the starter role at the age of 32 in 2013, but by that time Campbell was definitively a backup and nothing more. His Browns totals reflect that, as Campbell posted 11 touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 76.9 passer rating in eight starts.

<strong>Key stats: 8 starts, 11 TD, 8 INT, 76.9 rating</strong>
<h2>20. Brian Hoyer, 2013-2014</h2>
Brian Hoyer is a local guy, either loved or hated by Browns fans depending on their desire to see Johnny Football take the field. Hoyer started briefly in 2013 and then majority of 2014, ultimately recording 17 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, and a 77.6 passer rating. He left to play in Houston in 2015, backed up Jay Cutler in 2016, and went 0-6 in six starts with the 49ers in 2017. The 32-year-old signed a three-year deal with the Patriots in November of 2017.

<strong>Key stats: 16 starts, 17 TD, 16 INT, 77.6 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> Johnny Football.</em>

<h2>21. Johnny Manziel, 2014-2015</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930656" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930656" title="Johnny Manziel didn't work out in Cleveland." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-488845593.jpg" alt="Johnny Manziel didn't work out in Cleveland." width="757" height="556" /> Johnny Manziel didn't work out in Cleveland. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Johnny Manziel (AKA Johnny Football) was an extremely polarizing college football player. Jerry Jones badly wanted to draft him, despite already having Tony Romo in his prime. Jones passed, and the Browns took Manziel with the 22nd pick in 2014. Manziel would unfortunately be just another in a long line of quarterback failures in Cleveland, going 2-6 in his eight starts with seven touchdowns, seven interceptions, and a 74.4 passer rating. <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/list/johnny-manziels-antics-incidents-nfl-career-browns/15v4mnf95yndc1asv20mdixa6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcohol (and legal) problems have ended his career already</a>, barring a comeback in 2018.

<strong>Key stats: 8 starts, 7 TD, 7 INT, 74.4 rating</strong>
<h2>22. Connor Shaw, 2014</h2>
Who? Connor Shaw went undrafted and made one appearance in the NFL, starting a single game for the Cleveland Browns in 2014. The 23-year-old was not good, going 14-for-28 with 177 yards and an interception in a 20-10 loss to the Ravens. Assuming Shaw doesn't come back and play in the NFL again -- a possibility, as he's only 26 -- he will finish with a 55.2 passer rating.

<strong>Key stats: 1 starts, 0 TD, 1 INT, 55.2 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> The greatest in (modern) franchise history?</em>

<h2>23. Josh McCown, 2015-2016</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930653" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930653" title="Josh McCown of the Cleveland Browns passes against the New York Jets." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-488047068.jpg" alt="Josh McCown of the Cleveland Browns passes against the New York Jets." width="757" height="504" /> Josh McCown of the Cleveland Browns passes against the New York Jets. | Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images[/caption]

Josh McCown, as sad as this statement is, may just be the best Browns quarterback (since their NFL return in 1999) to start at least 11 games for the team. He started eight games in 2015, posting a 93.3 passer rating with 2,109 yards, 12 touchdowns, and four interceptions. The 36-year-old wasn't quite as good the following year, starting just three games for Cleveland. McCown finished his Browns career with a 1-10 record in his 11 starts but with an 85.7 rating.

<strong>Key stats: 11 starts, 18 TD, 10 INT, 85.7 rating</strong>
<h2>24. Austin Davis, 2015</h2>
Austin Davis started eight games for the St. Louis Rams in 2014, compiling an 85.1 passer rating with 12 touchdowns to nine interceptions. So there was some optimism when the Browns picked him up as a backup heading into the 2015 season. The optimism was misplaced. Davis started two games for the Browns, throwing one touchdown, three interceptions, and putting up a 66.2 passer rating. In 2017, he was on the Seahawks' roster as a backup to Russell Wilson.

<strong>Key stats: 2 starts, 1 TD, 3 INT, 66.2 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> An injury-plagued disappointment.</em>

<h2>25. Robert Griffin III, 2016</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930657" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930657" title="Quarterback Robert Griffin III of the Cleveland Browns looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-602412784.jpg" alt="Quarterback Robert Griffin III of the Cleveland Browns looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles." width="757" height="558" /> Quarterback Robert Griffin III of the Cleveland Browns looks to pass against the Philadelphia Eagles. | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

The signing of Robert Griffin III seemed doomed from the start in Cleveland. Although Griffin had been excellent as a rookie with the Washington Redskins, he was injury prone and had started to decline by the time the Browns picked him up. Griffin was healthy for just five games during his stint in Cleveland, going 1-4 with two touchdowns, three interceptions, and a 72.5 passer rating. He did not play in the 2017 season, and it's unknown what the future holds for Griffin in the NFL.

<strong>Key stats: 5 starts, 2 TD, 3 INT, 72.5 rating</strong>
<h2>26. Cody Kessler, 2016</h2>
With Griffin missing the bulk of the year, 2016 third-round draft pick Cody Kessler stepped in to start eight games for the 2016 Browns. He actually wasn't bad at all, and in two seasons with the team has thrown six touchdowns with three interceptions and a 87.4 passer rating. Kessler is coming into the final two years of his four-year contract, and time will tell what his future looks like in the NFL.

<strong>Key stats: 8 starts, 6 TD, 3 INT, 87.4 rating</strong>

<em><strong>Next:</strong> An awful second-round pick.</em>

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>28. DeShone Kizer, 2017</h2>
[caption id="attachment_930828" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-930828" title="Quarterback DeShone Kizer of the Cleveland Browns passes." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-845377652-1.jpg" alt="Quarterback DeShone Kizer of the Cleveland Browns passes." width="757" height="504" /> Quarterback DeShone Kizer of the Cleveland Browns passes. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

DeShone Kizer was the second-round draft pick of the Browns in 2017, and he started 15 of the team's 16 games in his rookie year. Kizer led the NFL with 22 interceptions, posting a putrid 60.5 passer rating. The experiment with Kizer has likely come to an end, being that Cleveland has traded for quarterback Tyrod Taylor and is expected to draft another QB with the No. 1 overall pick in 2018.

<strong>Key stats: 15 starts, 11 TD, 22 INT, 60.5 rating</strong>
<h2>28. Kevin Hogan, 2017</h2>
The other quarterback that spent time under center in 2017 was Kevin Hogan. He started the one game that Kizer didn't play, starting against the Houston Texans in Week 6. That was his last appearance of the season with the Browns, but he did have a solid season. Over his last two games, Hogan was 36-for-56 passing with three touchdowns and four interceptions. It's unclear what, if any, future he has with the Browns.

<strong>Key stats: 1 starts, 4 TD, 7 INT, 61.5 rating</strong>

New York is the largest media market in the NFL. Everyone knows this, and it’s common knowledge that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mlb-why-a-rod-still-cant-shake-ped-suspicions.html/" target="_blank">all New York athletes have performed under heavy scrutiny</a>, for better or worse. When they win, the city’s rabid fans are the best in the business, and they’re merciless when a team is losing (just ask the Knicks). For their part, the New York Giants brought home NFL Championships in 1927, 1934, 1938, and 1956, prior to the NFL-AFL merger, and the advent of the Super Bowl.

In the modern era, the Giants claimed Lombardi trophies in 1986, 1990, 2007, and 2011. Over time, winning Giants football has showcased stout defense, ball control, and efficient quarterback play. The greatest five Giants of all time have each spectacularly risen to the occasion.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Frank Gifford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_764991" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-764991 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Gifford-University-of-Southern-California-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="1160" /> University of Southern California/Getty Images[/caption]

Before his time in broadcast journalism, Frank Gifford was once arguably the most celebrated athlete in America. In his prime, Gifford was a full-time, two-way player who started at running back and cornerback, and could rotate back under center to sling passes as quarterback in a pinch.

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GiffFr00.htm" target="_blank">In 1956</a>, Gifford led the NFL in yards from scrimmage, with 819 yards on the ground and 603 receiving yards. That year he accounted for 11 total touchdowns en route to NFL MVP honors. To close out the season, Gifford racked up 131 receiving yards out of the backfield, as part of a 47-7 route over the Chicago Bears to win the NFL Championship.

In 1958, Gifford helped lead the Giants back to the NFL Championship game against the Baltimore Colts. The Giants, however, went on to lose the <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1805" target="_blank">“Greatest Game Ever Played"</a>, 23-17 against the Baltimore Colts, in overtime. At the time, the Giants had Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry working the sidelines as offensive and defensive coordinators, respectively

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Eli Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752779" align="aligncenter" width="755"]<img class="wp-image-752779 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Eli-Manning_Super-Bowl.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="504" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

Bonafide NFL royalty, fans could have simply referred to young Eli Manning as “Archie’s son," or “Peyton’s little brother." Fresh out of Mississippi, Eli Manning’s legions of critics ripped his proclivity for taking sacks, firing the football into triple coverage, giving up ill-timed interceptions, and offering up blank stares.

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannEl00.htm" target="_blank">In 2007</a>, Eli Manning led the league in interceptions, with 20. Fan perception toward Eli Manning, however, decisively changed in a New York minute that postseason. In these playoffs, a white-hot Manning led the Giants to three straight road victories as a 10-6 NFC Wild Card, before staring down the then 18-0 New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.

On third down, late in the game, Eli Manning spun out of the pressure, and fired a bullet down the seam to David Tyree. Tyree caught the ball with his helmet and went down in a heap with Patriots safety Rodney Harrison to pick up the first down. Moments later, Manning would toss the winning score to Plaxico Burress on a fade pattern, before the quarterback walked away with MVP hardware.

In 2011, Manning led a 9-7 NFC Wild Card team back to the Promised Land, after completing 65% of his passes for 1,219 yards and 9 touchdowns through the postseason. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Giants dispatched of the Patriots again with Eli Manning bringing home his second MVP award.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Michael Strahan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765036" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765036 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Strahan-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

At his best, Michael Strahan was the greatest sack artist of his generation. With his size and strength, Strahan would often pin his ears back, and bull rush tackles into the ground before making his way to the quarterback. He could also simply beat his man upfield, spin, and work his way back to the quarterback for a devastating hit, displaying his uncommon quickness.

In all, Strahan closed out his 15-year career as a Giant with 141.5 sacks, then good for fifth of all time. That included <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/sacks_single_season.htm" target="_blank">a 2001 season</a> where he powered his way to 22.5 sacks, the standing single-season record. For the 2007 postseason run, Strahan emerged as the elder statesman and heart and soul of the New York Giants. Prior to every game, he led the Giants onto the field with his “Stomp You Out” chant. From there, Strahan backed up his talk with two timely sacks in the Playoffs.

Most importantly, Michael Strahan, Justin Tuck, and Osi Umenyiora were part of an aggressive defensive front that harassed Golden Boy quarterback Tom Brady into several critical mistakes <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200802030nwe.htm" target="_blank">throughout Super Bowl XLII</a>. For the game, Brady took five sacks, including one from Strahan.

<h2>4. Lawrence Taylor</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743676" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-743676 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LT-Mark-D.-Philips-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="540" /> Mark D. Philips/Getty Images[/caption]

In the hands of Bill Parcells and defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, Lawrence Taylor was free to blitz off the edge, match up one-on-one against backs and tight ends in coverage, or drop off into the short zone. In either scenario, LT roamed free to wreak havoc and blow up opposing offenses. Two tight end sets and single-back formations came back into vogue throughout the ’80s, largely as gimmicks to neutralize and confuse No. 56. Still, nothing worked — Taylor was arguably the greatest defensive weapon of all time.

Taylor took home NFL MVP honors <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylLa00.htm" target="_blank">in 1986</a> after terrorizing offenses for 20.5 sacks. Behind LT, the 1986 Giants gave up a mere 14.8 points per game, going 14-2 overall. This 1986 postseason was somewhat of a coronation for the G-Men, as they rolled to take the Lombardi trophy with a combined 105-23 score in three games. On the backstretch of his career, Lawrence Taylor helped the Giants claim another Super Bowl, against the Bills in 1990.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Phil Simms</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765077" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765077 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Simms-Tim-DeFrisco-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images[/caption]

You could (erroneously) dismiss Phil Simms as a game manager who rode the coattails of a dominant defense and running game to glory. In 1983, even Bill Parcells himself made the mistake of benching him. That year, without Simms in command, the Giants collapsed to 3-12. The following year, Parcells went back to Simms as the starting quarterback, and the Giants closed out the regular 1984 season at 9-7, before losing to the 49ers in the Divisional Playoff round.

Over time, Phil Simms emerged as the perfect fit to lead the Giants’ ball-control offense. He favored tight end Mark Bavaro as a security blanket, while also mixing in deep throws to his wide receivers to keep defenses honest. In 1986, Simms was at his best <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198701250den.htm" target="_blank">in Super Bowl XXI</a> against the Denver Broncos. In taking MVP honors, Simms worked the short zone for 268 yards passing and 3 touchdowns. For the game, Simms went 22 for 25, which set a record for Super Bowl completion percentage, at 88%.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/">Pro Football Hall of Fame has a spot reserved</a> for Tom Brady. That's a given. The 39-year-old quarterback was set to go down as one of the all-time greats to ever play the game well before he guided the New England Patriots to the biggest comeback win in Super Bowl history over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl 51. Brady's triumph simply served as icing on the cake when it comes to his legacy in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Football League</a>.

With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-patriots-win-super-bowl-51.html/">five Super Bowl rings</a>, seven AFC championships, four Super Bowl MVP awards, and two NFL MVP awards already on his resume, it's time to look at Brady's argument for being the best quarterback in NFL history. To do this, we compiled Brady's career regular-season, playoff, and Super Bowl stats, including his all-time rankings. Here is a look at what we came up with. Breathe easy; none of it involves PSI measurements.

<h2>Regular season</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742694" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742694" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tom-Brady_Pats.jpg" alt="Quarterback Tom Brady looks for his target." width="757" height="527" /> Quarterback Tom Brady looks for his target. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Tom Brady's regular-season numbers will impress any NFL fan. Although the 39-year-old doesn't lead the way in every single category, he ranks near the top for nearly all of them. And if Brady plays as long as he is planning to (<a href="http://nesn.com/2016/12/tom-brady-sounds-serious-about-playing-until-hes-45-why-would-i-stop-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he is on record</a> saying that he would like to play until he's 45), he will completely re-write the NFL's regular season passing record book.

From a statistical perspective, Brady is already the greatest postseason quarterback in NFL history. And it's not even close. If the Patriots continue their run of dominance in the AFC until he retires, Brady will put these records so far out of reach that they will fall into the unbreakable category.

Like his playoff records, Brady's Super Bowl superlatives will likely stand the test of time. He now holds the records for most Super Bowl wins, most Super Bowl appearances, most Super Bowl MVP awards, and practically ever major passing statistic.

Brady’s case as the best quarterback of all time got a serious boost with his performance in Super Bowl XLIX. The argument grew even more with his MVP-caliber performance during the 2015 regular season. And it hit a peak with his performance against the Falcons in Super Bowl 51.

He now holds nearly <a title="Tom Brady Super Bowl Records" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12265898/new-england-patriots-qb-tom-brady-wins-3rd-super-bowl-mvp-award" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every major Super Bowl passing record</a> in addition to the record for most Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback. More importantly, Brady surpassed Joe Montana, the quarterback many consider to be the best to ever play the game, for the most Super Bowl wins and most Super Bowl MVP awards.

Brady also holds multiple playoff quarterback records and is in the top five in nearly every career regular-season passing category. He has hinted that he has "<a title="Tom Brady: &quot;I've Got A Lot of Football Left&quot;" href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/02/02/tom-brady-super-bowl-xlix-win-records-career-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of football left"</a> to play in his career, meaning that he is highly likely to improve his standing in every category. If he truly does play another five to seven seasons, Brady will almost surely hold every regular-season passing record, every postseason passing record, and every Super Bowl passing record.

Furthermore, we firmly believe that Brady has yet to win his final Super Bowl title. Brady likely has enough gas left in his tank to turn in at least two or three more elite-level seasons. If that truly happens, it will be extremely hard for even his biggest critics to argue against him as the best ever.

Professional football is the epitome of all things American. We love the sport <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-intimidating-players-nfl-2017.html/">because of the grit</a>, intensity, teamwork, force, and speed of the game. To win as a team, each individual player must know his assignment, execute, and sacrifice himself at the point of attack. Football is a chess match. Players must shift positions, read, react, and dominate smaller battles to help the larger group prevail.

To the uninitiated, the game of football may simply showcase two walls of humanity crashing into each other. Beyond the color-coded play sheets and complex zone-blocking schemes, the ultimate goal remains to advance the ball to the other side of the field for points.

The greatest NFL players dismiss the conventional wisdom and time-­honored clichés of football diehards. They can concert casual spectators into game-day fanatics. Indeed, no defense exists for the perfect pass, speed does kill, and defense can be your best offense. On the gridiron, the greats demand an eyewitness account at all times. We struggled to describe this supreme ability in words as they redefine what is possible.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Reggie White, defensive end</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696156" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696156" title="Reggie White celebrates a win" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/52027616-e1410291488544.jpg" alt="Reggie White celebrates a win" width="757" height="600" /> Reggie White is one of the greatest NFL players. | Joe Picciolo/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Minister of Defense dominated the line of scrimmage throughout his 15-­year career, playing well into his late 30s. At left defensive end, Reggie White terrorized opposing right tackles with his patented hump and club moves. From a three-point stance, White would anticipate the snap count, explode up­field, and shrug his shoulders. Then he'd toss aside yet another 300-pound lineman and take a shot at the quarterback.

Against the running game, White possessed both the strength to shed blockers and the speed to chase down ball carriers. This skill set translated into two AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, in 1987 and 1998, when White led the league with 21 and 18 sacks, respectively. Before retirement, White racked up a then-NFL record 198 sacks. He made 13 consecutive Pro Bowl appearances (1986­-1998) and won a Super Bowl championship with the Green Bay Packers.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Tom Brady, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761605" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761605" title="Tom Brady waves to his wife after winning Super Bowl 51" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-633958588.jpg" alt="Tom Brady waves to his wife after winning Super Bowl 51" width="757" height="505" /> Who won his fifth Super Bowl ring? This guy. | Getty Images[/caption]

At quarterback, Tom Brady has emerged as one of the greatest rags-to-riches stories of all time. He entered the NFL as a doughy sixth-round pick out of Michigan. But Brady eventually transformed into front-­page fodder for both the sporting and celebrity gossip magazines. By 37, Brady has already taken home five Lombardi trophies and four Super Bowl MVP awards, granting him the bragging rights as one of the greatest football players of all time.

As an icon, he has combined Joe Montana’s winning gamesmanship alongside the playboy lifestyle of “Broadway” Joe Namath. Statistically, Brady is equally impressive as any quarterback to ever play professional football.

In 2007, he teamed up with Randy Moss and Wes Welker to create one of the most impressive displays of offensive firepower ever. Brady closed out that undefeated regular season having thrown for 4,806 yards and a then-record 50 touchdowns after completing 68.9% of his passes. The 2007 run, however, ended with a Super Bowl loss, an 18-­1 record, and a disheveled Brady.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Don Hutson, wide receiver</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681962" title="Don Hutson posing for a photo" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/don-hutson_pg_600.jpg" alt="Don Hutson posing for a photo" width="757" height="505" /> Don Hutson | NFL.com[/caption]

Don Hutson dominated in his position. At wide receiver for the 1935-45 Green Bay Packers, Hutson helped introduce the game of football to slant, rub, deep out, and crossing routes, which first unlocked the timing complexities of the forward pass. As the game’s first big-time wide receiver, several of Hutson’s records stood for decades (Steve Largent and Jerry Rice finally broke them).

Today, Hutson still holds the NFL record for the most seasons (nine) spent leading the league in touchdowns. On several occasions, Hutson’s production actually doubled the statistics of his next-best competitor. In 1942, Hutson caught a league-leading 74 balls for 1,211 receiving yards and 17 touchdowns. These numbers were unreal for Hutson’s era.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Dick Butkus, linebacker</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710100" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710100" title="Dick Butkus autographs a photo" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/81166028-e1412968074222.jpg" alt="Dick Butkus autographs a photo" width="757" height="505" /> Dick Butkus | Skip Bolen/Getty Images[/caption]

With his dark No. 51 jersey, garish shoulder pads, and blood-curdling shrieks, Dick Butkus was a feared tackler. At 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, he led the Monsters of the Midway and their black-and-blue style of punishment. Chicago Bears lore remains steeped in the tradition of defense thanks to him. The unforgiving stare of Mike Singletary and pure athleticism of Brian Urlacher can’t match the devastation that Butkus brought to the fore at Soldier Field.

In the box, Butkus ran downhill to pull guards at the line of scrimmage and fold pesky running backs into the turf. In space, Butkus patrolled the middle of the field and laid down the law on any wayward receiver. Contrary to Butkus’s reputation as a total goon, the man was a student of the game. He could make tackles, strip the ball carrier, corral interceptions, and wreak havoc.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Johnny Unitas, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710102" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710102" title="Johnny Unitas greeting some fans" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/johnnyunitas-e1412968214827.png" alt="Johnny Unitas greeting some fans" width="757" height="568" /> Johnny Unitas | M. David Leeds/Getty Images[/caption]

Johnny Unitas was as American as apple pie, with his first-generation heritage, crew-cut hairstyle, and black high-top shoes. At quarterback, Johnny U was credited for authoring the two-minute drill and fourth-quarter comeback. As a virtual coach on the field, Unitas called his own plays to pick apart defenses throughout his 18­-year career.

Unitas, of course, will forever be immortalized as a Baltimore Colt. He led the NFL in passing on four separate occasions and won the league MVP award three times. Unitas finished his career with 40,239 passing yards, which is still good for 14th place on the all-­time list. Johnny U’s statistics are even more impressive ­­when you consider the fact that he was a quarterback during the 1950s and '60s. This was prior to the advent of five-­wide sets, the shotgun spread, and all other pass­-happy gimmicks.

Unitas put his full talents on display in “The Greatest Game Ever Played,” which ushered professional football into the television era. That game pitted a total of 17 Hall of Famers against each other, both Baltimore Colts and New York Giants, for the 1958 championship grudge match.

Late in the game, Unitas engineered two separate 80-­yard drives to send the contest into overtime on a short field goal. Baltimore claimed the title on a one-­yard touchdown dive by Alan Ameche. As the winning quarterback, Unitas went 26-40­­ for 349 passing yards and one touchdown. In doing so, the Comeback Kid laid the groundwork for the likes of John Elway, Peyton Manning, and Joe Montana.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Walter Payton, running back</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710107" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710107" title="Walter Payton featured on Wheaties" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/walterpayton-e1412968427728.png" alt="Walter Payton featured on Wheaties" width="757" height="504" /> Walter Payton featured on Wheaties | Tim Boyle/Getty Images[/caption]

Walter Payton simply outworked everybody else. At 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, Payton was neither a physically imposing, bruising back, nor was he blessed with track star speed. On the playing field, the man they called Sweetness was known for his iron will to finish off runs in the image of his lunch-pail work ethic and madman fitness program. As a testament to his durability, Payton owned the rushing record books at the end of his 13­-year career with the Chicago Bears. By retirement, he had racked up 16,726 rushing yards and 110 total touchdowns. As a true workhorse back, Payton led the NFL in carries for four consecutive seasons between 1976 and 1979. In 1977, Payton carried the football 339 times to run roughshod over the competition for 1,852 yards and a 5.5 yards­ per ­carry average.

Vintage Payton would take the inside handoff and juke a flailing defensive lineman with a quick spin move before slamming his knee into the chest of a stunned linebacker in the hole. After breaking that tackle, Payton kept diminutive defensive backs at bay with a stiff arm before he bounced the play to the outside and headed off to the races. Refusing to run out of bounds, Payton would drop his pads and lower the boom at the goal line to drive his last opponent into the end zone.

<h2>4. Lawrence Taylor, linebacker</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710049" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710049" title="Lawrence Taylor sacking an opponent" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52031298.jpg" alt="Lawrence Taylor sacking an opponent" width="757" height="542" /> Lawrence Taylor mid-sack | Mark D. Phillips/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

At linebacker, Lawrence Taylor (pictured above, center) was the maddest of all mad men. Because of his pure explosiveness, Taylor was the game’s foremost defensive weapon. In the 3­-4 scheme, Taylor lined up all over the field to sell out his body, force turnovers, and destroy careers. Taylor was too fast for plodding tackles and too powerful for blocking backs to contain coming off the edge at the line of scrimmage. Within two counts, the quarterback would get decked and stripped of the football in one fell swoop. As a sack artist, Taylor compiled 132.5 quarterback sacks over his 13­-year career, which is still good for tenth all-time.

In coverage, Taylor could also drop back to man up against running backs into the flat. Playing with reckless abandon, Taylor appeared to hate all comers who wore opposing jerseys. Through pure intensity, L.T. altered offensive schemes. Today, we can actually credit a linebacker for the evolution of the H­-Back, single­back formations, double tight ends, and unbalanced lines. These offensive packages largely trace their roots back to Joe Gibbs and his gimmick formations, designed to contain No. 56.

<h2>3. Joe Montana, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705400" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705400" title="Joe Montana mid-throw" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51550838.jpg" alt="Joe Montana mid-throw" width="757" height="507" /> Joe Montana mid-throw | Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Joe Montana (pictured above, throwing) can lay claim to four Lombardi trophies and three Super Bowl MVP awards. Known for his quiet confidence, Joe Cool pointed out John Candy in the Super Bowl XXIII stands while his teammates huddled up. After breaking the ice, Montana had his 49ers on the march before he flicked the game-­winning toss to John Taylor on a slant route into the end zone.

Montana was not your classic Golden Boy quarterback. Out of Notre Dame, Montana’s draft stock plummeted — NFL scouts questioned his size, arm strength, and general toughness. Montana slid all the way down to the third round ­before Bill Walsh got his man with the 82nd overall pick in the 1979 NFL Draft. Montana, because of his ability to deliver the football with precision and touch, was a perfect fit for the precise timing of the West Coast offense.

In the prolific West Coast offense, Montana could dump off short passes to the likes of Jerry Rice, John Taylor, Roger Craig, and Tom Rathman, and let his receivers go to work with runs after the catch. Although Montana and his 49ers are historically regarded as a finesse bunch, this group showed its moxie in countless comeback victories and cold-weather playoff bloodbaths. Before the Super Bowl trophies, Montana proved his toughness to the world with both “The Catch” and his beatdown of the 1988 Chicago Bears against the backdrop of single­-digit temperatures and the swirling winds of Soldier Field. Montana has more than earned the title of one of the best football players in NFL history.

<h2>2. Jim Brown, running back</h2>

Jim Brown dominated everybody. Over the course of his nine seasons, Brown ran over, through, and around people for 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns on the ground. At 29, he shocked the world and retired from the game of football in his prime. Brown simply had nothing else left to prove, having already qualified as the record holder of every significant rushing mark in the books. Although Brown has since been surpassed by Emmitt Smith and Walter Payton in the record books, neither back can touch his remarkable 5.2-­yard-per-carry average.

As the perfect complement of size and speed, Brown put up video-game-­like numbers in the era of the phonograph and turntable. With the exception of 1962, Brown led the NFL in rushing every year between 1957 and 1965. In 1963, he torched defenses for 1,863 rushing yards on only 291 carries, which translates into a 6.4-yard-per-carry average.

<h2>1. Jerry Rice, wide receiver</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710124" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710124" title="Jerry Rice on the move" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/51968912-e1412968986325.jpg" alt="Jerry Rice on the move" width="757" height="555" /> Jerry Rice | Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

By every qualification, Jerry Rice was the greatest wide receiver of all time. He had the best hands, ran the most precise routes, and starred as the premier game changer after the catch. Rice, the San Francisco Treat, may even hail as the greatest blocking wide receiver of all time. And as an NFL bootstrapper, he serves as another monument to hard work.

In all, Rice rewrote the NFL record books for 1,549 receptions, 22,895 receiving yards, and 208 total touchdowns. Rice’s career and statistical records are breathtaking, as he proved to be a lock for 80 catches, 1,000 yards, 10 touchdowns, and one Pro Bowl ticket to Hawaii for 13 seasons. He was a threat to score on every play.

Rice earned his position. In the offseason, he would jog the rugged hills of Northern California, lift weights twice a day, and run wind sprints until he had nothing left –­­ for fun. Before he had even stepped onto the field, Rice and his will to work had already destroyed many an opponent.

		<description><![CDATA[Tom Brady claimed his fifth Super Bowl one year after a disastrous AFC Championship game. What are the 7 worst games of the quarterback's career?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[For <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-were-the-6-quarterbacks-drafted-ahead-of-tom-brady.html/">former sixth-round draft pick</a>, Tom Brady, the majority of his legendary career is nothing short of skillful and brilliant. In fact, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/">has been so good</a> over the course of his 16-year career that many people question whether or not <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/">the man is human</a>. Well, to prove that No. 12 can in fact make mistakes, Brady has experienced a handful of forgettable performances -- some costing his New England Patriots critical games.

Even if those performances are few and far between, we likely saw Brady near his worst in the Patriots' 2015 AFC Championship loss to the Denver Broncos. With a redemption officially in the books after a decisive win against the Falcons a year later, here are the seven worst games of Tom Brady’s career, ranked in chronological order.
<h2>1. New England vs. Buffalo (2003)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_592304" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-592304" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady calls a field goal good | Source Getty Images" width="757" height="543" /> Tom Brady has had a few terrible games in his time as an NFL superstar | Source Getty Images[/caption]

A year after missing the 2002 NFL Playoffs, Tom Brady and the New England Patriots hoped to rebound and see a much more successful year. However, the way that the 2003 season started must have made Patriots fans feel like they were in for another long, heartbreaking season. The team traveled to play their division rival Buffalo Bills and simply never got off the plane, as the Bills <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200309070buf.htm">walloped them 31-0</a>. Brady completed a mere 50% of his passes and threw four interceptions. The game still stands as the worst loss of his storied career. Of course, that season New England rebounded to finish with a 14-2 record and a second title in three seasons, so things ended much better for the Pats.

<h2>2. New England vs. Kansas City (2005)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_935627" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-935627" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady-Houston-Texans-v-New-England-Patriots-YUIJbwJ5h4Fl.jpg" alt="Tom Brady: The 7 Worst Games of His Career" width="757" height="517" /> Tom Brady considers his future in the NFL | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Any time Brady throws four interceptions, it's surprising for his fans and critics alike. We saw him do this against the Bills in 2003, but he's only done it six times in 256 career games (including the playoffs). Well, this game <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200511270kan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against the Kansas City Chiefs</a> back in 2005 saw No. 12 look vulnerable once again. Aside from throwing four picks, Brady was only able to complete a little over 50% of his pass attempts. To make matters worse, the Patriots also lost the game 26-16. Brady went on to lose in the playoffs for the first time in his career following the 2005 season after nine straight postseason wins.

<h2>3. New England vs. Indianapolis (2006)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_529265" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-529265" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tom-Brady_Peyton-Manning.jpg" alt="Kevin C.

In a season that saw the Patriots fall to Peyton Manning and the Colts in the AFC Championship game, Brady also struggled with Indianapolis during the 2006 regular season. It was another one of those horrific zero touchdown/four interception games for Brady, as New England <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200611050nwe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost by seven points</a> at home. Brady failed to reach a completion percentage of 60% in the loss against his friend and rival Manning.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. New England vs. San Diego (2006 playoffs)</h2>
<h2></h2>
[caption id="attachment_935629" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-935629" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady-AFC-Championship-New-England-Patriots-J7c63Ly30r2l.jpg" alt="Tom Brady: The 7 Worst Games of His Career" width="757" height="505" /> Quarterback Tom Brady walks off the field after a loss | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Tom Brady always steps up his game when it comes to the postseason. Well, almost always. After losing to the Denver Broncos for his first career playoff defeat, Brady and the Patriots returned for the 2006 season looking for another Super Bowl ring. The San Diego Chargers nearly tripped them up in the divisional round that season thanks to Brady’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200701140sdg.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lackluster three-interception performance</a>. However, this was a rare game when the Patriots won in spite of Brady’s mistakes; they moved on the AFC Championship with a three-point victory. Unfortunately, the Colts beat them in that championship game.

<h2>5. New England vs. Baltimore (2009 playoffs)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_733734" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-733734" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tom-Brady_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="IRVING, TX - OCTOBER 14: Quarterback Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots walks off the field during the game against the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium on October 14, 2007 in Irving, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)" width="757" height="511" /> Tom Brady walks off the field | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

This game stands as the worst loss of Brady's epic playoff career, as the Baltimore Ravens came into Foxborough and ran over the Patriots in the wild-card round, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201001100nwe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning by a score of 33-14</a>. No. 12 only accumulated 154 yards while completing 54% of his passes and throwing three interceptions. The 2009 season also stands as one of only two times Brady has experienced a "one-and-done" postseason appearance.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. New England vs. Baltimore (2012 playoffs)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671709" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671709" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="Tom Brady: The 7 Worst Games of His Career" width="757" height="494" /> Quarterback Tom Brady sits on the sidelines | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

After the 2009 loss to the Ravens in the playoffs, it's likely that Brady never wanted to see Baltimore in the playoffs again. Well, the 2012 postseason matched him up with those Ravens again; this time in a rematch of the previous season's AFC Championship game. As an underdog team, Baltimore came to New England and stomped the Patriots by a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201301200nwe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">score of 28-13</a> on their way to the Super Bowl. Brady did not help New England's cause. He completed a low percentage of his passes and tossed two interceptions.

<h2>7. New England vs. Denver (2015 playoffs)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598876" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598876" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady-AFC-Championship-New-England-Patriots-dZsmThTOO20l.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="473" /> Tom Brady's worst game came during the 2015 AFC Championship | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Brady has participated in 33 career playoff games. Before the 2015 AFC Championship, he never experienced a completion percentage under 50% in any of those games. However, Brady did just that against the Denver Broncos' fierce pass rush, as he completed just 48% of his 56 pass attempts prior to a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201601240den.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots loss, 20-18</a>. He did manage to pass for over 300 yards in this game, but he threw two costly interceptions (and another on the two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game). Brady simply could not get into a consistent rhythm. Many say that Denver's defense on Sunday was the best Brady has ever faced. Despite that fact, this was still one of the worst games of his legendary career.

NFL quarterbacks are judged not only by their statistics, but also by whether or not they have a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-li.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl ring</a>. For example, former Miami Dolphins great Dan Marino put up huge numbers <span class="s1">-- </span>evident by the fact that he retired with virtually every major passing record in league history (Brett Favre and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-retires-a-look-back-at-his-18-year-nfl-career.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peyton Manning</a> since broke his records) <span class="s1">-- </span>yet he seemingly never gets mentioned as one of the best quarterbacks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to ever play</a> simply because he retired without winning a Super Bowl title.

A handful of current, potential <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-there-be-any-first-ballot-hall-of-famers-in-2017.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hall of Fame</a> NFL quarterbacks may fall victim to the same shortcoming as Marino. While some will eventually get the Super Bowl monkey off their backs, the majority never will. Here is a look at the 15 best (current) NFL quarterbacks who have yet to win a Super Bowl ring <span class="s1">-- in no particular order</span>.

<em>Note: We only considered NFL quarterbacks who have at least 16 career starts</em>

<h2>1. Derek Carr, Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_664170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-664170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Derek-Carr_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-3-1024x682.jpg" alt="Derek Carr looks for a target." width="757" height="504" /> Derek Carr and the Oakland Raiders have a long way to go before they will contend for a Super Bowl title. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>21-25</li>
 	<li>.457 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>60.8% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>10,962 passing yards</li>
 	<li>78 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>31 interceptions</li>
 	<li>87.3 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
In his third NFL season, Derek Carr has emerged as a legitimate franchise quarterback. After two seasons full of up and down play, everything has come together for the former Fresno State signal caller. The Raiders already clinched a spot in the AFC Playoffs with an 11-3 overall record, and Carr is a serious contender to take home the NFL MVP award in January.

At only 25-years-old, Carr is just starting to scratch the surface of his potential as one of the more talented NFL quarterbacks. With the supporting cast the Raiders surround him with, there is a good chance that Carr could be in position to compete for a Super Bowl title within the next two or three years.

<h2>2. Marcus Mariota, Tennessee Titans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_700460" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-700460" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Marcus-Mariota_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Marcus Mariota looks across the field." width="757" height="505" /> Marcus Mariota is finding his way in the NFL. | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>11-15</li>
 	<li>.423 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>62.2% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>6,145 passing yards</li>
 	<li>44 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>19 interceptions</li>
 	<li>94.3 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Marcus Mariota quickly proves to be fully deserving of the hype he entered the league with as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. After experiencing a fairly steep learning curve as a rookie, the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner has been outstanding. The Titans still have a lot of work to do before we can consider them legitimate Super Bowl contenders, but with Mariota under center, they are well on their way to becoming one of the premier teams in the AFC.

<h2>3. Tyrod Taylor, Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682363" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682363" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Tyrod-Taylor_Brett-Carlsen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tyrod Taylor gestures as he walks across the field." width="757" height="505" /> The pressure is on Tyrod Taylor and the Buffalo Bills to win. | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>14-13</li>
 	<li>.519 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>62.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>5,928 passing yards</li>
 	<li>34 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>14 interceptions</li>
 	<li>91.0 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Tyrod Taylor has been in the league since 2011, but didn't lock his first full-time starting job until the 2015 season. Based on what we've seen from the former Virginia Tech Hokie, the Bills appear to have finally found their franchise quarterback (they signed Taylor to a five-year, $90 million contract extension last summer).

If he continues to improve his game inside the pocket, Taylor could ultimately become a perennial Pro Bowler. However, for him to win a Super Bowl, he will need to be substantially better and get some help from the rest of his team.

<h2>4. Jameis Winston, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_666133" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-666133" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jameis-Winston_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="Jameis Winston smiles after throwing a touchdown pass." width="757" height="504" /> Jameis Winston had a breakout season in 2016. | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>14-16</li>
 	<li>.467 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>59.5% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>7,653 passing yards</li>
 	<li>47 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>30 interceptions</li>
 	<li>85.6 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Jameis Winston is making the Buccaneers look incredibly wise for selecting him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. The former Florida State standout has the Bucs back in contention for a spot in the NFC playoffs, and he is just starting to get comfortable at the professional level. If Tampa Bay can continue to effectively build their team around him, we can totally see Winston winning a Super Bowl ring some time in the next decade.

<h2>5. Alex Smith, Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713360" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713360 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alex-Smith-Chiefs.jpg" alt="Alex Smith looks for a target." width="757" height="534" /> Alex Smith looks for a target. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>77-56-1</li>
 	<li>.579 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline"> Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>61.6% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>27,338 passing yards</li>
 	<li>154 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>89 interceptions</li>
 	<li>85.1 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
The former No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft has resurrected his career in Kansas City, yet Alex Smith remains somewhat of a long shot to win his first Super Bowl title as a starting quarterback anytime soon. The Chiefs have a solid team, and have the capability to beat any team in the AFC when they play well.

But in the end, there is little chance that they can get by the likes of the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers in the postseason for the right to represent the AFC in Super Bowl LI next February.

<h2>6.  Kirk Cousins, Washington Redskins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_588910" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588910" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Kirk-Cousins_David-Banks_Getty-Images-1024x678.jpg" alt="Kirk Cousins grips the football." width="757" height="501" /> Kirk Cousins has helped revive the Washington Redskins. | David Banks/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Record: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>18-20-1</li>
 	<li>.474 winning percentage</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career Statistics: </span>
<ul>
 	<li>66.0% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>11,556 passing yards</li>
 	<li>70 touchdown passed</li>
 	<li>40 interceptions</li>
 	<li>93.8 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Kirk Cousins came out of nowhere to lead the Redskins to the NFC East division title in 2015. In his first full season as the Redskins' starter, the former Michigan State standout played at a Pro Bowl level and made everybody in Washington quickly forget how disappointing Robert Griffin III's career with the team turned out. And Cousins has followed that up with an equally impressive performance in 2016.

The Redskins will likely sign Cousins to a long-term extension this offseason, but for them to have a realistic chance at winning a Super Bowl title, they will have to continue to fill the holes on the rest of their roster.

<h2>7.  Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_601661" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-601661" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cam-Newton-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images-1024x691.jpg" alt="Cam Newton smiles during a pre Super Bowl press conference." width="757" height="511" /> Cam Newton came close to winning his first Super Bowl ring in 2015. | Thearon W.

</ul>
Cam Newton has a rare athletic ability as well as the ability to overcome immaturity issues that slowed his development early in his career. The 2010 Heisman Trophy winner is the reigning NFL MVP and the face of the Panthers franchise. Newton came within one win of capturing his first Super Bowl title in 2015, but the 2016 season was a massive disappointment for Carolina.

If Newton can regain his 2015 form and the rest of the Panthers roster can recapture their swagger, we fully expect to see the 6-foot-6, 260-pounder win a Super Bowl title before hanging up his cleats.

<h2>8.  Matthew Stafford, Detroit Lions</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713370" align="aligncenter" width="760"]<img class="wp-image-713370" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matt-Stafford_.jpg" alt="Matthew Stafford looks for a target in the backfield." width="760" height="566" /> Matthew Stafford has had a solid career, but a Super Bowl title seems unlikely at this point. | Joe Sargent/Getty Images[/caption]

</ul>
Matthew Stafford was the No. 1 pick by the Lions in the 2009 draft. While the Lions have been dreadfully bad at times during most of his NFL career, the former Georgia Bulldog has developed into one of the best pure passers in the league.

In 2016, Stafford officially established himself as an elite NFL quarterback -- despite losing All-Pro wide receiver Calvin Johnson to retirement. While we aren't ready to call the Lions Super Bowl contenders, we really wouldn't be surprised to see them make a deep playoff run if Stafford continues to play at his current level.

<h2>9.  Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals</h2>

 	<li>87.9 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Early in his career, Carson Palmer looked like the next great NFL quarterback. After a rough patch during his final years with the Cincinnati Bengals and his disastrous two-year stint with the Oakland Raiders, the 2002 Heisman Trophy winner looked like he had settled in nicely with the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2015, Palmer played at an All-Pro -- and borderline MVP -- level while guiding the Cardinals to the NFC Championship Game. The 2016 season was a different story though. The Cardinals missed the NFC Playoffs altogether in 2016, and Palmer's time with the franchise could come to an end if the team can find a viable replacement this offseason.

<h2>10.  Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons</h2>

 	<li>114 interceptions</li>
 	<li>93.1 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Heading into the 2016 season, Matt Ryan was at a bit of a crossroads in his career. He had flashed signs of brilliance in his first five seasons, but from 2013<span class="s1">–</span>15, the former Boston College signal<span class="s1">-</span>caller struggled mightily with inconsistency issues. However, in 2016, Ryan silenced all of his critics, earning the unquestioned distinction of being an elite NFL quarterback.

As the Falcons continue to improve defensively, their legitimacy as Super Bowl contenders will also continue to increase. Based on what we've seen this year, Atlanta is one or two players away from having a complete enough roster to win a world championship.

<h2>11.  Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713372" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713372 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tony_Romo.jpg" alt="Tony Romo looks to throw." width="757" height="559" /> Tony Romo has had a solid NFL career, but has still yet to play in a Super Bowl. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li>97.1 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Tony Romo's days as the Cowboys' starting quarterback are over. But you can't deny that he is still one of the better signal callers in the league when healthy. There was a decent chance that Romo could have won a ring as Dallas' backup. Even though he didn't, the 36-year-old should have a chance to compete for a world championship as a starter in 2017. We fully expect Romo to land with a franchise that already has a Super Bowl-caliber roster in place.

<h2>12.  Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568013" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568013" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andy-Dalton_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Andy Dalton is still looking for his first playoff win | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li>140 touchdowns</li>
 	<li>80 interceptions</li>
 	<li>89.0 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
In 2015, before he got hurt, Andy Dalton reached a point where most people around the NFL considered him a legitimate MVP candidate. The 2016 season wasn't as kind to the former TCU signal caller, but we cannot ignore the fact that the Bengals are almost always competitive with Dalton under center. That said, while he proves to be one of the better regular-season NFL quarterbacks, Dalton currently has a career postseason record of 0-4.

<h2>13.  Philip Rivers, San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers</h2>

 	<li>95.0 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
When Philip Rivers eventually retires, he will do so with a Hall of Fame-caliber statistical resume. With that being said, it's hard to envision a scenario where the Chargers have a strong enough roster to have a legitimate chance at competing for a Super Bowl title before Rivers hangs up his cleats.

<h2>14.  Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713377" align="aligncenter" width="760"]<img class="wp-image-713377 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Andrew_Luck.jpg" alt="Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="760" height="537" /> Andrew Luck is the highest-paid player in NFL history, but he has yet to play in a Super Bowl | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li>128 touchdowns</li>
 	<li>65 interceptions</li>
 	<li>87.2 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Andrew Luck is one of the premier NFL quarterbacks today. He is now the highest-paid player in NFL history. When he is healthy and at the top of his game, Luck is a bona fide MVP candidate. The former Stanford Cardinal has singlehandedly carried the Colts to wins throughout his four-year NFL career, and he will continue to improve with time.

With Luck, the Colts have the most important building block of a potential Super Bowl-ready roster already in place. However, for Indy to ever have a chance at winning a world championship, they must be substantially better on defense and along their offensive line.

<h2>15. Teddy Bridgewater, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568847" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568847" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Teddy-Bridgewater_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Dustin Bradford/Getty ImagesDENVER, CO - OCTOBER 4: Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater #5 of the Minnesota Vikings throws as he warms up before a game against the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on October 4, 2015 in Denver, Colorado.

</ul>
When he's healthy, Teddy Bridgewater has the look of a budding franchise quarterback. He may not be as flashy as some, but the former Louisville signal caller has excellent pocket awareness, a great command of Minnesota's offense, and the unquestioned respect of his teammates.

Only time will tell if he is able to come back from the gruesome knee injury he suffered last summer. If he does, the Vikings already have a championship-caliber defense in place, which means a Super Bowl title isn't out of the realm of possibilities for Bridgewater.

		<description><![CDATA[With Super Bowl LI just days away, here's a look at the top 7 Super Bowl-winning teams in NFL history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems like an aeon ago, but back in February 2015 the Seattle Seahawks had the chance to become only the eighth team in the history of the National Football League to repeat as Super Bowl champions. With a win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX, the Seahawks would have joined the exclusive club of repeat Super Bowl champions.<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-seahawks-wont-be-super-bowl-51-contenders.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Naturally, they lost</a>. Had they won, though, would that have made them one of the best Super Bowl-winning teams of all time? Probably not.

Here is a look at the seven best Super Bowl-winning teams in NFL history (in no particular order).
<h2>1. Miami Dolphins, Super Bowl VII</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750682" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-750682 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1972-Dolphins.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="527" /> Alex Wong/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 14-0

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Head coach</span>: Don Shula*

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Key players</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>Larry Csonka, running back*</li>
 	<li>Mercury Morris, running back</li>
 	<li>Paul Warfield, wide receiver*</li>
 	<li>Earl Morrall, quarterback</li>
 	<li>Dick Anderson, defensive back</li>
 	<li>Jake Scott, defensive back</li>
 	<li>Nick Buoniconti, linebacker*</li>
 	<li>Bill Stanfill, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Larry Little, offensive line*</li>
 	<li>Jim Langer, offensive line*</li>
 	<li>Bob Griese, quarterback*</li>
</ul>
This team remains the only team in NFL history to go undefeated for an entire season, which is a distinction that will likely stand for many years to come. The Dolphins had Hall of Famers all over the field, and will always be known as one of the best teams in the history of professional football.

<h2>2. Chicago Bears, Super Bowl XX</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750686" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-750686 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1985-Chicago-Bears.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 15-1

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Head coach</span>: Mike Ditka*

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Key players</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>Jim McMahon, quarterback</li>
 	<li>Walter Payton, running back*</li>
 	<li>Mike Singletary, linebacker*</li>
 	<li>Richard Dent, defensive line*</li>
 	<li>Dan Hampton, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Steve McMichael, defensive line</li>
 	<li>William Perry, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Leslie Frazier, defensive back</li>
</ul>
This team was known for its <a title="1985 Chicago Bears Defense" href="http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/85-Bears-ranked-top-Super-Bowl-team/c75036c8-61f4-4904-b0d5-ec941fda56d0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking defense</a>, the “<a title="Super Bowl Shuffle" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDqOxGK3J40" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl Shuffle</a>,” several polarizing personalities, and a swagger unlike anything the league had seen up to that point. The free-spirited Jim McMahon and Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton led the offense, while Richard Dent and Mike Singletary led one of the best defenses the league has ever seen. Buddy Ryan’s Bears defense was so dominant that he joined Mike Ditka in being carried off of the field by the Chicago players following their 46-10 Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots.

<h2>3. Denver Broncos, Super Bowl XXXIII</h2>

 	<li>Alfred Williams, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Steve Atwater, defensive back</li>
 	<li>Jason Elam, kicker</li>
</ul>
This Denver Broncos team was one of the few teams in NFL history to repeat as Super Bowl champions. In what turned out to be quarterback <a title="John Elway's Last NFL Game" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/super-bowl-xxxiii-elway-rides-susnet-broncos-top-falcons-article-1.1584085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Elway’s last NFL game</a>, he won the Super Bowl XXXIII MVP award after the Broncos beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-19. This team actually had a chance to flirt with a perfect season but lost a close game to the New York Giants in Week 15 for their first loss of the season. Running back Terrell Davis won the National Football League MVP award this season following his 2,008-yard regular season.

<h2>4. Dallas Cowboys, Super Bowl XXVII</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750692" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-750692 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Emmitt-Smith_Michael-Irvin.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="378" /> Chris Wilkinds/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 13-3

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Head coach</span>: Jimmy Johnson

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Key players</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>Troy Aikman, quarterback*</li>
 	<li>Emmitt Smith, running back*</li>
 	<li>Daryl Johnston, fullback</li>
 	<li>Michael Irvin, wide receiver*</li>
 	<li>Jay Novacek, tight end</li>

 	<li>Jim Jeffcoat, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Leon Lett, defensive line</li>
 	<li>Ken Norton Jr., linebacker</li>
</ul>
This was the first Super Bowl win for the Dallas Cowboys during their dynasty of the 1990s. After easily rolling through the NFC playoffs, the Cowboys crushed the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII. During their lopsided 52-17 Super Bowl victory over the Bills, the Cowboys defense forced nine turnovers. Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith (1,713 yards and 18 touchdowns), and Michael Irvin (1,396 yards and seven touchdowns) were the key players on a nearly unstoppable Dallas offense.

<h2>5. San Francisco 49ers, Super Bowl XIX</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750695" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-750695 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Super-Bowl-XIX.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="494" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 15-1

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Head coach</span>: Bill Walsh*

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Key players</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>Joe Montana, quarterback*</li>
 	<li>Dwight Clark, wide receiver</li>
 	<li>Ronnie Lott, defensive back*</li>
 	<li>Eric Wright, defensive back</li>
 	<li>Randy Cross, offensive line</li>
 	<li>Dwight Hicks, defensive back</li>
</ul>
This team often gets overlooked when talking about the great 49ers teams of the 1980s and 1990s. All this team did was go 15-1, with its only loss coming by three points to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the Super Bowl, the Joe Montana-led 49ers crushed the Dan Marino-led Miami Dolphins by a score of 38-16.

<h2>6. San Francisco 49ers, Super Bowl XXIV</h2>
[caption id="attachment_750698" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-750698 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Super-Bowl-XXIV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="944" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 14-2

 	<li>Roger Craig, running back</li>
 	<li>Jerry Rice, wide receiver*</li>
 	<li>John Taylor, wide receiver</li>
 	<li>Charles Haley, outside linebacker</li>
 	<li>Bill Romanowski, linebacker</li>
 	<li>Ronnie Lott, defensive back*</li>
</ul>
This may have been the best all-around team during the 49ers’ dynasty during the 1980s and 1990s. Ironically, Bill Walsh, the legendary coach who built the 49ers into a dynasty, did not coach this team. This group dominated nearly every game it played, including the Super Bowl, when the 49ers defeated the Denver Broncos by a score of 55-10.

<h2>7. Washington Redskins, Super Bowl XXVI</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Regular-season record</span>: 14-2

 	<li>Art Monk, wide receiver*</li>
 	<li>Gary Clark, wide receiver</li>
 	<li>Darrell Green, cornerback</li>
 	<li>Wilbur Marshall, linebacker</li>
</ul>
This team was one of the most dominant NFL teams of all time despite playing with a bunch of guys that other franchises viewed as castoffs. During the 1991 regular season, the Redskins outscored their opponents by a combined score of 485-224 and outscored their playoff opponents by a combined score of 102-41.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_570020" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570020" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aaron-Rodgers_Rob-Carr_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers reacts during the game." width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers reacts during the game | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/super-bowl/">Super Bowl</a> has grown to the point of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/should-the-super-bowl-be-a-holiday-1454612826">being a national holiday</a>. One would think that football <span class="s1">-- </span>you know, the reason we park in front of our TVs all day to begin with <span class="s1">-- </span>would regularly be played at a high level. Makes sense, right? The biggest football game of the season should feature top-tier football.

Yet not every Super Bowl-winning team is created equal. Some teams didn’t have great regular-season records; they didn't “fire up the jets” until just before the big game. Some were quietly “meh,” but had a schedule that they steamrolled right through. Other teams regularly worked several interceptions into their repertoire and still won the biggest game of the year. Here are the 10 worst NFL teams to have won a Super Bowl, ordered by year.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. 1970 Baltimore Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751176" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751176" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Super-Bowl-V-Baltimore-Colts.jpg" alt="The Baltimore Colts battle in Super Bowl V | Source: The Baltimore Gridiron Report The Baltimore Colts battle the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V." width="757" height="457" /> The Baltimore Colts battle the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V | Source: The Baltimore Gridiron Report[/caption]

Hard to believe that this team, which led the AFC that season, made this list. But as <a href="http://www.thesportster.com/football/the-15-worst-teams-to-win-a-super-bowl/">The Sportster</a> notes on their “worst SB teams” list, this incarnation of the now-Indianapolis franchise had an impossibly easy schedule and only modest stats when you looked past their 11-2-1 record. What's worse: They participated in the poorly-played Super Bowl V, in which Baltimore notched seven of the 11 turnovers in the contest.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. 1982 Washington Redskins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751175" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751175" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/John-Riggins-Washington-Redskins.jpg" alt="Running back John Riggins of the Washington Redskins looks on during the Super Bowl XVII against the Miami Dolphins." width="757" height="539" /> Running back John Riggins of the Washington Redskins looks on during the Super Bowl XVII against the Miami Dolphins | Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

Whacky things happen in a shortened season. Such is the case for the Super Bowl XVII champion <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/washington-redskins/">Washington Redskins</a>. Despite having neither a streamroller offense or a stonewall defense, the team took advantage of a relatively easy schedule and went 8-1 on the regular season. Things looked bleak when they were <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxvii">down 17-10</a> to Dolphins at halftime in the Super Bowl. Then they turned the tables and held Miami scoreless in the second half to emerge with the 27-17 victory.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. 1983 LA Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751177" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751177" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Todd-Christensen-Los-Angeles-Raiders.jpg" alt="Todd Christensen of the Los Angeles Raiders runs the ball." width="757" height="505" /> Todd Christensen of the Los Angeles Raiders runs the ball | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

The last time Los Angeles had bad professional football teams, they had a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/oakland-raiders/">Raiders team</a> that won a Super Bowl. But don’t let their Super Bowl win fool you. This edition of the Silver &amp; Black ranked 26th out of 29 teams on defense, and won most of their contests by just a couple points. But again, those stats aren’t as noticeable since they walloped on the Washington Redskins 38-9 in the Super Bowl.

<h2>7. 1988 San Francisco 49ers (10-6, 62%)<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_709235" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709235" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/49ers-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Candlestick in its heyday, as running back James Primus of the Atlanta Falcons rushes for a touchdown past cornerback Don Griffin." width="757" height="504" /> Candlestick in its heyday, as running back James Primus of the Atlanta Falcons rushes for a touchdown past cornerback Don Griffin | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

Seriously, how dare a Joe Montana/<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-wide-receivers-of-all-time.html/">Jerry Rice</a> team make this list? How does a team that was dominant on both sides of the ball land here?

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they drudged through close games to finish just 10-6 on the regular season. This <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/san-francisco-49ers/">Niners</a> team is a prime example of a group that turned it on late; they looked touch-and-go after starting the season 6-5, but then finished the year out strong. San Francisco made mincemeat of the Vikings and Bears, respectively, in the playoffs before a snagging a tight-knit contest from the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. 2001 New England Patriots (11-5, 68%)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589710" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589710" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Patriots-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images-640x428.jpg" alt="Adam Vinatieri celebrates Super Bowl victory." width="757" height="506" /> Adam Vinatieri celebrates a Super Bowl victory | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Some remember this team as the beginning of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/">Tom Brady Era</a>. Others remember it for the AFC championship “Tuck Rule” game that controversially sent the Pats to the big dance over the Oakland Raiders. But focus solely on how the team faired, and there is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/15-teams-missed-playoffs-went-super-bowl.html/">plenty left to be desired</a>. They went 5-5 over 10 regular-season contests with an offense adjusting to a new QB and a defense ranked 24th overall in the league.

While it was the start of the Patriots' <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">many championship trips</a> in recent years, many parties saw them as unwelcome after the way they won over the Raiders to punch their Super Bowl ticket.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers (11-5, 68%)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709228" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Steelers-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jerome Bettis of the Pittsburgh Steelers runs over Brian Urlacher the Chicago Bears for a touchdown." width="757" height="501" /> Jerome Bettis of the Pittsburgh Steelers runs over Brian Urlacher the Chicago Bears for a touchdown | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The ’05 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-pittsburgh-steelers-of-all-time.html/">Steelers</a> are a perfect example of a team that waited until the last minute to get hot. While ending the regular season 11-5 doesn’t sound all that bad, they sat at 7-5 after Week 12 and pulled out eight straight wins to punch a Super Bowl ticket.

They also got a bit of luck in the Conference Championships against Indianapolis when Colts’ kicker Mike Vanderjagt imploded. (Yes, that would be the same Mike Vanderjagt that Peyton Manning called “an idiot.”) <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-stadiums.html/">Pittsburgh</a> went on to win Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. 2008 New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_579659" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-579659" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tom-Brady-and-Eli-Manning.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Eli Manning greet each other on the field." width="757" height="511" /> Tom Brady and Eli Manning greet each other on the field | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

It shocks many that this Giants team makes so many “worst SB teams” lists, given that they kept the New England Patriots from going down in history as the first team to record a 19-0 season. But what makes this game such an upset is that this New York squad wasn’t very good. This rendition of Tom Coughlin’s Giants went 10-6 on the regular season and scraped through the playoffs, including the low-scoring Super Bowl.

<h2>2010 Green Bay Packers (10-6, 62%)<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_736780" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-736780" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Green-Bay-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Worst Teams to Ever Win a Super Bowl" width="757" height="504" /> Greg Jennings reacts during Super Bowl. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Like the 49ers, the Packers didn’t turn on their “all right, now we’re just going to steamroll everyone" engines during the regular season, when they went a good -- but not great -- <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2010.htm" target="_blank">10-6 during the first 16 weeks</a>, alternating one or two wins with a loss (although they did win three straight from Week 7 to 11, since Week 10 was a bye). Then, franchise quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/aaron-rodgers/" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers</a>, because Aaron Rodgers, and the rest of the Packers totally dismantled the Atlanta Falcons in the divisional game. Oh, and they won a Super Bowl, too.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. 2011 New York Giants (9-7, 56%)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709239" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709239" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Giants-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="FOXBORO, MA - NOVEMBER 6: Jake Ballard #85 of the New York Giants scores against the defense of Tracy White #58 of the New England Patriots in the second half on November 6, 2011 in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

In <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">Brady versus Eli</a> Part 2, neither team was as good as they had been a couple Super Bowls before. So if that ’07 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-new-york-giants-of-all-time.html/">Giants</a> team wasn’t very good, the 2011 team was worse. They eked into the playoffs that season after losing four of their final eight games to go 9-7 on the season, an all-time low for a championship-winning team.

This particular Super Bowl performance was ever-so-slightly more exciting, (although <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-tale-of-every-super-bowl-halftime-show-since-2006.html/">Madonna’s halftime show performance</a> was still more engaging.) After being down 17-9 in the third quarter, New York made good on a couple field goals and a sturdy drive late in the game helped them emerge victorious 21-17. Despite the win however, this isn’t a model for a great team mastering a season and winning a championship.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. 2012 Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674380" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674380" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ray-Lewis-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ray Lewis holds up a newspaper that reads &quot;World Champions.&quot;" width="757" height="505" /> Ray Lewis goes out a champ | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Super Bowl XLVII will go down as the Harbaugh Bowl <span class="s1">-- </span>when brothers Jim and John stood on opposite sidelines and gave viewers all the split-screen madness they could possibly ask for. The game was meant to be a rematch of the previous season’s Thanksgiving Day matchup, which had been a defense-heavy tilt between the 49ers and Ravens.

But by the time these teams met back up nearly a year-and-a-half later, the matchup wasn’t the same. Baltimore’s defense wasn’t as healthy or as intimidating; a healthy d-corpse consisting of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-top-5-baltimore-ravens-of-all-time.html/">Ray Lewis and Terrell Suggs</a> would make any defense scary. But what they did have was an answer for the Niners’ <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-sports-scandals-of-2016.html/">newly-minted starting QB Colin Kaepernick</a>. Despite a 17-point third quarter from San Francisco, the Ravens managed a 34-31 victory.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. 2016 Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661684" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661684" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Peyton-Manning_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos looks at the Vince Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl 50." width="757" height="537" /> Peyton Manning of the Denver Broncos looks at the Vince Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl 50 | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

How is it that last year’s champion Broncos made this list? How could we possibly suggest that Peyton Manning is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">anything but a Super Bowl hero</a>?

For starters, an injury-plagued Peyton ranked last in the league in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/peyton-manning-had-the-worst-season-of-any-super-bowl-quarterback-ever/">adjust net yards per attempt</a>. With backup Brock Osweiler putting up decent numbers in the six games that Manning was out, Denver also ranked 19th in points scored and led the NFL in interceptions. That last part was evident to anyone who watched the Broncos and Panthers trade off turning the ball over <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/money-ever-bet-nfl-game.html/">in Super Bowl 50</a>.

Much of this isn't remembered though, as Peyton still capped off his career <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-athletes-retire-champions.html/">with a Super Bowl win</a> before retiring.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_594155" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594155" title="The Super Bowl Lombardi Trophy is hoisted in the air." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/GettyImages-462643976-1024x682.jpg" alt="The Super Bowl Lombardi Trophy is hoisted in the air." width="757" height="504" /> Some teams may never win a Super Bowl title. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

In theory, the structure of the NFL is designed to give all 32 teams a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-52.html/">chance to compete</a> for a Super Bowl title. The worst teams in the league get the highest draft picks; the league's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hard salary cap</a> is in place to prevent the formation of "super teams"; and the best teams are supposed to be rewarded with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/which-team-has-the-toughest-2017-nfl-schedule.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most difficult schedules</a> in the league for the next season. In reality, though, the NFL is extremely top-heavy; some franchises may never experience the thrill of winning a Super Bowl title.

A lot can change with one outstanding draft class (look at the 2016 Dallas Cowboys) or an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-best-nfl-free-agent-signings-of-all-time.html/">exceptional free-agent signing</a> (look at the Denver Broncos with Peyton Manning). Nevertheless, these 10 NFL teams have never won a Super Bowl <span class="s1">-- </span>and perhaps never will.

<h2>1. Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713801" title="David Johnson sprints down the field." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/David-Johnson-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="David Johnson sprints down the field." width="757" height="505" /> David Johnson is a game-changer. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

The current Cardinals seem to have already reached their peak. While they have some of the most talented individual players in the league (running back <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-career-rushing-leaders.html/">David Johnson</a>, and defensive backs Tyrann Mathieu and Patrick Peterson), the overall talent on their roster is trending <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/8-american-cities-with-the-most-miserable-sports-fans.html/">in the wrong direction</a>.

Quarterback Carson Palmer has seen better days; future Hall of Fame wide receiver <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-draft-pick-in-every-nfl-franchises-history.html/">Larry Fitzgerald</a> will be 34 years old when the 2017 season kicks off, and their defense must find a way to make up for the losses of defensive end Calais Campbell and safeties, Tony Jefferson and D.J. Swearinger. Unfortunately, it seems like the Cardinals will have to rebuild their roster once again before they will be ready to legitimately contend for a Super Bowl title.

<h2>2. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_771605" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-771605" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Carson-Wentz-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images-1024x675.jpg" alt="Carson Wentz of the Philadelphia Eagles looks to pass." width="757" height="499" /> Will Carson Wentz help end the Eagles' Super Bowl drought? | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

Truth be told, the Eagles' extremely passionate fanbase <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-sports-franchises-desperately-need-a-championship.html/">deserves to see their team</a> win a Super Bowl title at some point. They've experienced plenty of chances in the past. But the fact remains that the Birds still lack a Lombardi Trophy. Their current roster is talented, but even the most optimistic Philadelphia supporters will tell you that they are at least two strong draft classes away from being a legitimate competitor in the NFC.

When it comes down to it, the Eagles' chances of winning a Super Bowl anytime in the foreseeable future likely <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-contenders.html/">depend on</a> quarterback Carson Wentz. Maybe 2018 will see the Eagles taking home the trophy -- only time will tell.

<h2>3. Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_592157" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-592157" title="LeSean McCoy holds the football during warmups." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/LeSean-McCoy_Mitchell-Leff_Getty-Images-1024x716.jpg" alt="LeSean McCoy holds the football during warmups." width="757" height="529" /> LeSean McCoy won't get a ring with the Bills. | Mitchell Leff/Getty Images[/caption]

This tortured franchise may have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-super-bowl-blowouts-nfl-history.html/">four straight Super Bowl</a> appearances in the '90s, but it's starting to look like they may never make it back to the game's biggest stage. Since their last Super Bowl appearance in 1993, the Bills have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-longest-losing-streaks-in-sports-history.html/">made it to the postseason</a> just four times; they're currently in the midst of a 17-year playoff drought. With their roster currently in a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/">state of flux</a>, it's hard to imagine their streak of disappointing seasons ending anytime soon.

The Bills had to break in a new head coach in 2017 (Sean McDermott). They also have to deal with the unfortunate reality of playing in the same division as the New England Patriots. The Bills, and their incredibly loyal fanbase may just be cursed.

<h2>4. Tennessee Titans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621875" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621875" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-Mariota_Stacy-Revere_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Marcus Mariota indicates a touchdown." width="757" height="504" /> The Titans may never win a world championship. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

In one of the most gut-wrenching finishes to a Super Bowl ever, the Titans came up one yard short of victory against the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXIV. As it turns out, that may be the closest this franchise will ever get to tasting Super Bowl glory.

We are huge fans of the foundation Tennessee has built on their current roster. If Marcus Mariota can take the next step and become a truly elite NFL quarterback, and they can continue to build a viable defense, the Titans could be seriously competitive in the AFC. Until that happens (if it happens at all), Tennessee will remain an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-nfl-teams-that-just-cant-stop-sucking.html/">average football team</a>.

<h2>5. Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713173" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713173" title="Sam Bradford looks for a target" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sam-Bradford-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-1024x618.jpg" alt="Sam Bradford looks for a target" width="757" height="457" /> Sam Bradford won't lead the Vikings to a Super Bowl title. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

The Vikings <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-franchises-without-super-bowl-title.html/">came up short</a> in three Super Bowls during the '70s and have failed to make an appearance since. As it currently stands, Minnesota is somewhat stuck in limbo. They have an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/strongest-nfl-defenses-in-history.html/">extremely talented</a> (and young) defense. But with their holes on offense, the Vikings will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-nfl-teams-that-have-lost-the-most-modern-era-playoff-games.html/">struggle to win</a> more than eight or nine games in a single season. Adrian Peterson is gone, and at the end of the day, we just don't see Sam Bradford ever guiding this team to a Super Bowl appearance. Sadly, the Vikings are still a long way away from being a bona fide contender in the NFC.

<h2>6. Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>

In their 22 years of existence, the Jaguars have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-nfl-teams-players-least-want-to-join-even-for-twice-the-pay.html/">yet to play in a Super Bowl</a>. They came close in the late '90s, but ultimately came up short in two AFC Championship Games (1996 and 1999). With the way things look right now, it will be a long time before we ever see the Jags play for a world championship.

After six straight seasons with 11 or more losses, Jacksonville can be optimistic heading into 2018. They built a defense that looks like one of the better defensive units in the league (on paper), and they have a handful of talented building blocks in place on offense. Don't be fooled, though: the Jaguars are still several years away from being considered Super Bowl contenders.

<h2>7. Los Angeles Chargers</h2>

The Chargers have just one Super Bowl appearance (a blowout 49-26 loss to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIX) in franchise history. With the current state of their roster, we don't see them even coming close to making another appearance anytime soon.

Philip Rivers, who has singlehandedly kept the Chargers somewhat competitive for the last seven years, likely only has a handful of seasons remaining in his career, which means that the Bolts are on the verge of taking a step back in the near future. That said, we don't expect LA's newest franchise to even be considered a serious threat in the AFC anytime soon.

<h2>8. Cleveland Browns</h2>

While we are firm believers that the city of Cleveland deserves to see their beloved Browns win a Super Bowl title <span class="s1">-- </span>they did have to suffer through watching their original franchise move to Baltimore, become the Ravens, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-worst-teams-to-win-a-super-bowl.html/">win two Lombardi Trophies</a> after all <span class="s1">-- </span>we simply don't see it happening anytime in the foreseeable future.

Despite having Pro-Bowl talent at a handful of positions, the Browns' current roster <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/evaluating-the-4-worst-front-offices-in-the-nfl-over-the-years.html/">is a disaster</a>, and their rebuilding project looks like a job that will last at least three to five years. Bottom line: It will likely be another decade before the possibility of the Browns <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-teams-that-made-the-playoffs-with-a-losing-record.html/">legitimately competing</a> in the AFC becomes a reality.

<h2>9. Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568013" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568013" title="Andy Dalton pumps his fist after throwing a touchdown pass" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andy-Dalton_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andy Dalton pumps his fist after throwing a touchdown pass" width="757" height="505" /> The Bengals just aren't a Super Bowl-caliber team. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Cincinnati has made two Super Bowl appearances through the years. But sadly, we just don't see them returning to the big game anytime soon. The Bengals are currently at a crossroads as a franchise. In our eyes, they already peaked with their current core nucleus of players (Andy Dalton, A.J. Green, and others). With the roster attrition they went through this offseason, we believe they'll take a step back.

Realistically, Cincy likely has about a five-year window to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/15-teams-missed-playoffs-went-super-bowl.html/">compete for a championship</a> (we don't see it happening) with Dalton under center, before they have to start over on yet another rebuilding project.

<h2>10. Detroit Lions</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577327" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577327" title="Matthew Stafford looks discouraged." src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Matthew-Stafford-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images-1024x697.jpg" alt="Matthew Stafford looks discouraged" width="757" height="515" /> It may never happen for the Detroit Lions | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cities-that-have-the-biggest-nfl-fans.html/">Lions</a> are hands down one of the least successful franchises in the league since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. They are one of four NFL teams that have never played in a Super Bowl. Truth be told, they've never even come close (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-nfl-teams-that-have-choked-away-the-most-wins-in-nfl-history.html/">the closest</a> was a 41-10 loss to the Washington Redskins in the 1991 NFC Championship Game).

Looking forward, Detroit has one of the best quarterbacks in the league (Matthew Stafford), which gives them a major advantage in their quest for their first Super Bowl title. That said, even if Stafford continues to play MVP-caliber football, the Lions simply do not have a championship-level roster. They don't have time for a lengthy rebuilding project (during the Stafford era), but with a couple strong offseasons the Lions could potentially compete in the NFC.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_702944" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702944" title="Vinny looking serious" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Vinny-Testaverde-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Vinny looking serious" width="757" height="504" /> Vinny Testaverde | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Nearly all sports, when played at the highest level, are pursuits for the young. Professional careers overlap with athletic peaks, which tend to occur early, and the aging process will eventually force everyone, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-hall-fame-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no matter their skill level or determination</a>, to retire. That said, retirement comes at different times for everyone, and for every Rashard Mendenhall -- who retired at 26 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rashard-mendenhall/rashard-mendenhall-retirement-_b_4931316.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to travel the world and write</a> -- there’s a Brett Favre, who, well, couldn’t stay gone.

The game of football isn’t easy for anyone, and it’s particularly difficult for quarterbacks, who spend the start of every possession staring down 11 guys who are being paid to take him off his feet with extreme prejudice. When we look at the already injury-riddled careers of guys like Sam Bradford, the idea that anyone could play as long as someone like Favre, who retired for the last time at 41, seems absurd.

Even Peyton Manning, who everyone agreed was more or less gassed, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00/gamelog/2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was "just" 39 when he played his last NFL game</a>. And that’s in the modern-day NFL, which is routinely dressed down as “touch football” or “flag football” by those in the fandom who don’t see why making a game safer is probably a good thing.

What’s really wild about Favre is that he doesn’t even come close to the oldest quarterbacks ever to suit up in the NFL. Using information gathered by the <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, here are the seven oldest quarterbacks in league history.

<h2>7. Mark Brunell<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_703004" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703004" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mark-Brunell-Jeff-Zelevansky-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Mark Brunell " width="757" height="503" /> Mark Brunell | Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images[/caption]

Playing from 1994 all the way until 2007, Brunell originally got his start with the Green Bay Packers, being taken in the fifth round of the 1993 draft. Despite that, he would spend the longest stint of his 17-season career with Jacksonville, holding down the G spot with the Jags from ’95 all the way to 2004, when he decamped to join the Redskins. Last playing for the Jets in 2011, the three-time Pro Bowler wound up leading the league in passing once, in 1996, and managed to lead the league in sacks twice, in ’96 and 2001. He retired at 41.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Earl Morrall</h2>
[caption id="attachment_910011" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-910011" title="Earl Morrall makes a pass" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/earl-morrall-video-screen-640x332.png" alt="Earl Morrall makes a pass" width="757" height="392" /> Earl Morrall | Ima Sportsphile via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmHZcnSsN_A">YouTube</a>[/caption]

When he became a member of the 1972 Miami Dolphins -- the only team to ever go undefeated from start to finish over a regular season and an entire playoff in NFL history -- quarterback Earl Morall had already been a professional football player for 17 seasons. Earl was drafted at 22, and he was 38 when the Dolphins went on their historic run. He would go on to play all the way through 1976, retiring at 42 and promptly finding a gig at the University of Miami.

<h2>5. Doug Flutie</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708246" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708246" title="Doug Flutie warms up with a pass before the game.

" width="757" height="501" /> Doug Flutie warms up with a pass before the game. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Prowling pro football sidelines from 1986 to 2005, Flutie spent the early part of his quarterbacking career bouncing from franchise to franchise before finally getting a starting shot with the New England Patriots — whereupon he promptly disappeared into the icy wilderness of the Canadian football league for a decade, returning to the NFL in 1998 to head up the signal calling for the Buffalo Bills and finally retiring with the same Patriots that first gave him the starting QB nod. He was 43 when he retired.

<h2>4. Vinny Testaverde</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703040" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703040 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Vinny-Testaverde-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Vinny Testaverde | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Everyone figured that Vinny Testaverde was going to have some kind of noteworthy NFL career after winning the Heisman and being drafted first overall in the 1987 NFL Draft, but we don’t know how many people would have bet on either his underwhelming CV for his time in the NFL, or the length of his career. In spite of his apparent mediocrity, Vinny Testaverde wound up spending 21 years in the NFL and was a professional football player until the age of 44.

<h2>3.  Warren Moon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Warren-Moon-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Warren Moon went to his fair share of Pro Bowls " width="757" height="606" /> Warren Moon went to his fair share of Pro Bowls. | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

A onetime record holder for the most passing touchdowns in NFL history, Warren Moon was able to parlay his physical gifts and throwing acumen into a career that spanned from 1983 to the year 2000, setting records and points of achievement that raise so many questions about what might have been.

Coming out of college in 1978, Moon saw zero interest coming from the NFL and spent the first five years of his post-collegiate career in the Canadian Football League. Imagine what could have happened if Moon, who retired at 44, was able to spend those seasons in the NFL.

<h2>2. Steve DeBerg</h2>
[caption id="attachment_485043" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-485043" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Steve-DeBerg-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="27 Dec 1998: Quarterback Steve DeBerg #17 of the Atlanta Falcons in action during the game against the Miami Dolphins at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.

So good that Peyton Manning allegedly studied his film, Steve DeBerg played in the NFL for two decades but only accumulated 140 starts -- which is why he’s known as a career backup, or, to steal a commonly used phrase from music and the arts, a quarterback’s quarterback. Picked up by Dallas in the 10th round, DeBerg spent time with the 49ers, the Chiefs, and Tampa Bay before ending his career in Atlanta.

<h2>1. George Blanda</h2>
[caption id="attachment_910038" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-910038" title="George Blanda going for a touchdown " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/george-blanda-screenshot-640x330.png" alt="George Blanda going for a touchdown " width="757" height="390" /> George Blanda going for a touchdown | wa4 Games via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQiBYmz66g4">YouTube</a>[/caption]

When it comes to quarterbacks in the NFL, there’s young, there’s Peyton Manning old, there’s Brett Favre old, and then there’s George Blanda. Blanda first played a professional football game in 1949 and wouldn’t retire until 1975 — at 48 — as the league’s leading scorer. He is also the only quarterback on this list to also kick field goals in professional NFL games, even if most of his numbers are pre-merger.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_706953" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-706953" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tom-Brady-New-England-Patriots.jpg" alt="Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots looks on from the bench in the second half against the Philadelphia Eagles on August 9, 2013 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennslyvania.

The New England Patriots overcame a 10 point deficit on their way to winning Super Bowl XLIX. Then they did it again, bigger and better in Super Bowl LI -- storming back from a 25-point hole to drop 31 unsanswered points on the hapless Atlanta Falcons. A 25-point comeback hadn't been seen since the 2014 regular season, when the Cleveland Browns (yes, seriously) pulled off an improbable and impressive comeback against the Tennessee Titans.

What's the common thread? That every sports fan enjoys watching a great comeback. Unless, of course, it’s happening at the expense of their favorite team (sorry Atlanta fans). Those wins got us thinking: Where do these comebacks rank on the list of all time biggest comeback wins in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-oldest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a> history?

We'll have more coverage about Brady and company's legendary Super Bowl for you, but for now let's take a look at the five biggest comeback wins in NFL history outside of Super Bowl LI -- which would be tied for the fifth position on this list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5 (tie). St. Louis Cardinals vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, November 8, 1987 — 25 Points</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707602" align="aligncenter" width="504"]<img class="wp-image-707602" title="Neil Lomax ready for a pass" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Neil-Lomax-333x500.jpg" alt="Neil Lomax ready for a pass" width="504" height="757" /> Neil Lomax | Mike Powell/Getty Images[/caption]

This comeback made watching two bad teams play much more exciting. The Buccaneers were a 4-11 team and the Cardinals were a 7-8 team in 1987. The Cardinals won this game 31-28 despite trailing 28-3 heading into the fourth quarter. An impressive defensive performance coupled with quarterback Neil Lomax led the furious comeback. Lomax finished with three fourth quarter touchdown passes including a 17-yarder to J.T. Smith that finally put the Cardinals ahead while the Cardinals defense added a touchdown in the final quarter on a fumble return, resulting in one of the best NFL comebacks.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5 (tie). <strong>Cleveland Browns vs. Tennessee Titans, October 5, 2014 — 25 Points</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_707608" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707608" title="Excited fans lose it over comebacks" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cleveland-Browns.jpg" alt="Excited fans lose it over comebacks" width="757" height="510" /> Excited fans lose it over comebacks | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Like most great comebacks, this game was a tale of two halves. The Browns went into halftime trailing 28-10 and showing no signs of life. A dominating second half led the Browns to a 29-28 victory. This comeback was kick-started by a blocked punt that resulted in a safety by Browns linebacker Tank Carder to open the fourth quarter. Brian Hoyer added two fourth quarter touchdown passes, both to Travis Benjamin, including the 6-yard game-winner with 1:09 left in the game to give the Browns the largest comeback in NFL history by a road team.

<h2>3. <strong>Buffalo Bills vs. Indianapolis Colts, September 21, 1997</strong> — <strong>26 Points</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_707616" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707616" title="Antowain Smith to play" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Antowain-Smith.jpg" alt="Antowain Smith ready to play" width="757" height="511" /> Antowain Smith | Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

The Colts, being quarterbacked by some guy named Jim Harbaugh, jumped out to a 26-0 lead to start this game. From that point on, the game belonged to the Bills. Buffalo added 10 points to close out the first half and a huge second half from running back Antowain Smith powered the comeback. Smith, who was a rookie at the time, finished the game with 129 yards and three touchdowns on only 12 carries. This comeback game also marked the beginning of the end for Harbaugh in Indianapolis. An embarrassing off-field incident, a 3-13 record, and a draft pick named Peyton Manning ultimately brought his Colts career to an end.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2 (tie). Indianapolis Colts vs. Kansas City Chiefs, January 4, 2014 — 28 Points</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707619" align="aligncenter" width="624"]<img class="wp-image-707619" title="Andrew Luck raises his fist " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Andrew-Luck-Colts.jpg" alt="Andrew Luck raises his fist " width="624" height="901" /> Andrew Luck | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

This wild card playoff game was truly an excellent game. Despite losing All-Pro running back Jamaal Charles on their very first possession of the game, the Chiefs were able to build a 31-10 lead by halftime. They added a touchdown on their opening drive of the second half to increase their lead to 38-10. That’s when the game really took a crazy turn. Colts’ quarterback Andrew Luck went on to throw three second-half touchdown passes while also scoring a touchdown on a fumble recovery he ran into the end zone. The Chiefs were able to add two second-half field goals, but that wasn’t enough. Luck’s final touchdown pass, a 64-yarder to T.Y. Hilton, proved to be the game-winner, giving the Colts a 45-44 victory.

<h2>2 (tie). San Francisco 49ers vs. New Orleans Saints, December 7, 1980 — 28 Points</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707625" align="aligncenter" width="636"]<img class="wp-image-707625" title="Joe Montana readies a pass" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Joe-Montana.jpg" alt="Joe Montana readies a pass" width="636" height="954" /> Joe Montana readies a pass | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

This is the biggest regular season comeback in NFL history. The visiting Saints, led by none other than Archie Manning, jumped out to a 35-7 lead in the first half. Hall of Famer Joe Montana who was in the second year of his illustrious career was quarterbacking the 49ers. The second half of this game was nearly as lopsided as the first — just in the other direction. New Orleans didn’t score another point and behind three Montana touchdowns (two passing and one rushing), the 49ers scored 28 second-half points and beat the Saints 38-35 on a 36-yard Ray Wersching field goal in overtime, granting us one of the best comebacks we've ever seen.

<h2>1. Buffalo Bills vs. Houston Oilers, January 3, 1993 — 32 Points</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707629" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707629" title="Frank Reich readies a pass" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Frank-Reich-640x426.jpg" alt="Frank Reich readies a pass" width="757" height="504" /> Frank Reich | Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

This game is known as “The Comeback.” In this wild card playoff matchup, the Oilers were led by future Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon, while the Bills were without their future Hall of Fame quarterback, Jim Kelly. Frank Reich stepped in and will be forever famous for leading the biggest comeback in NFL history.

Moon guided the Oilers to a 28-3 halftime lead, which would increase to 35-3 on an interception return for a touchdown to open the second half. The Bills, behind four touchdown passes by Reich and a rushing score by Kenneth Davis, went on a scoring tear and took a 38-35 lead. The Oilers did add a field goal to tie it up, but in seemingly fitting fashion, the Bills completed their comeback and won this game on a 32-yard field goal by Steve Christie in overtime.

The best <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cfb-5-schools-with-the-best-recruiting-classes-for-2016.html/">college football recruits</a> in the country choose to play ball at a particular school for two reasons: to win national championships and to make it to the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a>. It is really that simple. While only one team will find itself hoisting the trophy at the end of the season, the same cannot be said about sending players to the next level.

<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-rosters-by-school-2016-9" target="_blank">According to research</a> done by Business Insider, using data provided by the NCAA, through Week 3 of the 2016 season, there are 31 schools with at least 21 players on active NFL rosters. Clearly, these institutions know what it takes to develop young talent and prepare them for the opportunity to have careers at the game's highest level. Of course, as it is with most things, some programs do a much better job of this than others.

Since we’re always looking to determine the best of the best, we figured why not break this list down even further. With that in mind, here’s a look at the five colleges with the most players in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. (tie) Oregon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742996" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742996" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Oregon-Ducks-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Oregon's uniforms aren't the only enticing thing about the program | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Oregon's uniforms aren't the only enticing thing about the program | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 30

Recent struggles aside, let's not forget that the Oregon Ducks are only two years removed from competing in the CFP title game against Ohio State. This is a program with deep pockets (thank you, Phil Knight), a need for speed, and the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/celebrating-oregons-7-best-uniforms.html/">envious wardrobe</a> in all of college football.

Recruits may be drawn to Eugene, Ore. because of the "swoosh," but they're well aware of Oregon's track record of sending players -- 30 at the moment -- to the pros. This fact should keep the talent flowing in for years to come.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. (tie) Oklahoma</h2>
[caption id="attachment_582817" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582817" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Oklahoma-Sooners-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-640x439.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="520" /> The NFL houses plenty of Sooners | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 30

In his 18 seasons at Oklahoma, Bob Stoops has had more success than most head coaches could ever dream of. He's <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/bob-stoops-1.html">gone 189-48</a> (.797 winning percentage), coached 18 All-Americans, been the Big 12 Coach of the Year six times, and won a national championship during the 2000 season. His presence is a major draw for incoming recruits; that and potential for a career at the next level.

At this moment in time, 30 former Oklahoma players strut their stuff on Sundays. It's only a matter of time before this number rises.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. (tie) USC</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690685" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-690685" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USC-Football_Harry-How_Getty-Images-640x490.jpg" alt="USC has the explosive playmakers to give Alabama problems | Harry How/Getty Images" width="757" height="580" /> Trojans take their talents to the NFL | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 31

With the Rams recent return to the West Coast, USC is no longer the closest thing Los Angeles has to a professional football team. Still, that doesn't mean the Trojans won't continue to send players to the next level in droves. Having just 31 alumni playing in the NFL may seem like a small number for one of the nation's premier hotbeds of talent, but trust us, Trojan Nation is on the up and up.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. (tie) Auburn</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742990" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742990" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Auburn-Butch-Dill-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Auburn alum have been known to suit up on Sundays | Butch Dill/Getty Images" width="757" height="479" /> Auburn alum have been known to suit up on Sundays | Butch Dill/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 31

Auburn may struggle at times to keep pace with the rest of the SEC, but that doesn't stop the influx of talented, young players to the program. Recruits know that attending Auburn means playing in the national spotlight, competing against the nation's top talent, and having a legit chance to move on to the next level. 31 former Tigers, including the 2015 MVP, currently suit up in the National Football League. We don't imagine this changing anytime soon.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Clemson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578825" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578825" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Artavis-Scott-Tyler-Smith-Getty-Images-640x470.jpg" alt="Tyler Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="556" /> Loads of NFL talent comes from Clemson | Tyler Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 33

An elite head in Dabo Swinney, two straight ACC titles, and two consecutive trips to the College Football Playoff. This is what Clemson has to offer. And when you can get the job done against on a yearly basis, you're bound to get the attention of many of the nation's up-and-coming superstars; 33 players now compete on Sundays. Death Valley is clearly the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-the-5-greatest-venues-in-america.html/">place to be</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Georgia</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742984" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742984" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Georgia-Bulldogs-Todd-Bennett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Georgia sends plenty of talent to the next level | Todd Bennett/Getty Images" width="757" height="574" /> Georgia sends plenty of talent to the next level | Todd Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 36

Georgia consistently falls short of expectations, but that doesn't diminish the historical significance of the program. The Bulldogs have one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/college-football-teams-fans-come-see.html/">most diehard fanbases in the country</a>, a rich tradition of excellence, and a laundry list of superstar alumni. Georgia supporters might have to wait a bit before their team competes for national championships on a regular basis, but with 36 former players currently on NFL rosters, at least they know the school will never be short on incoming talent.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Florida</h2>
[caption id="attachment_704178" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-704178" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Florida-Gators-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="A lot of talent comes from the Swamp | Joe Robbins/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> A lot of talent comes from the Swamp | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 38

While this year's Florida Gators haven't been elite, the program itself has consistently been a hotbed for future NFL talent. In fact, during the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2016/draft.htm">2016 NFL Draft</a>, Florida had two players selected in the first 17 overall picks. Therefore, we're not surprised to learn that 38 former Gators currently suit up on Sundays. If we're totally honest, we thought there'd be more.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Ohio State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_704188" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-704188" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ohio-State-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Ohio State University | Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Ohio State University | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 39

Since Urban Meyer took over the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/urban-meyer-1.html">coaching reins at Ohio State</a> back in 2012, the Buckeyes have gone 53-4, finished in the top five in the AP poll three times, and won a national championship. With this sort of success, it's no wonder many of the nation's top high school recruits opt to take their talents to Columbus, Ohio.

Considering the program had five former players selected in the first 20 overall picks in the 2016 draft, along with 39 total Buckeyes currently suiting up in the National Football League, we don't see this trend fading anytime soon.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Florida State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_583742" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-583742" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Florida-State-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images-640x453.jpg" alt="Sam Greenwood/Getty Images" width="757" height="536" /> Florida State should take a bow | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 41

The Florida State Seminoles handle their business on the gridiron, win national championships, and send players to the National Football League. This isn't up for discussion, it's a bona fide fact. With Jimbo Fisher able to tell recruits that 41 former Seminoles currently play on Sundays, you better believe “The Chop" will continue to be out in full force in Tallahassee for years to come.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. LSU</h2>
[caption id="attachment_704204" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-704204" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/LSU-Tigers-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="The LSU Tigers have tons of talent in the NFL | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="528" /> The LSU Tigers have tons of talent in the NFL | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 42

Although the LSU Tigers haven’t won a national championship since 2007 and recently decided to part ways with longtime head coach Les Miles, quality recruits continue to head to Baton Rouge and join the program (at least for now anyway). Eventually, time will tell if Miles' dismissal affects the university's ability to recruit high-end talent.

Yet, in the meantime, the Tigers can point to the fact that 42 of their former players put on the pads on Sunday. As long as that remains a legitimate selling point, we expect the Bayou to keep booming.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Alabama</h2>
[caption id="attachment_704160" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-704160" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Alabama-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Alabama is No. 1 | Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Alabama is No. 1 | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Players on NFL rosters</span>: 43

The Alabama Crimson Tide may no longer posses that same air of invincibility -- save for their victory in the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2016-01-11-clemson.html" target="_blank">latest CFP national championship game</a> -- the team once had, but that doesn’t mean this football program isn’t still one of the most elite in the country.

Through a bevy of top-notch recruiting classes, Nick Saban not only continues to put a quality product out on the field, but he also continues to send a ton of talent to the next level. 43 players, to be exact -- the most in the National Football League in 2016. It’s no wonder the Tide keep rolling.

		<description><![CDATA[Pioneered by the Dallas Cowboys, the 40-yard dash now stands as the ultimate speed test for National Football League hopefuls.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_514704" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514704" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/40-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="504" /> The 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

“What’s the 40 time?" is a common refrain when discussing <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-steals-in-nfl-draft-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL hopefuls</a>. The 40, referring to the 40-yard dash, is the shorthand metric for comparative speeds between NFL prospects. It’s a curious conceit because the measurement almost never comes up after the draft. However, it remains arguably the most important result of any of the combine or pro day tests. At least, this is true for any non-quarterback position (the QB still has to demonstrate arm strength and accuracy).

For everyone else, though, the 40-yard dash is the do-or-die result. Why? Because of the Dallas Cowboys. Gil Brandt, a longtime Dallas personnel chief, was there when the team adopted the 40-yard dash as a standard test, and he explained the reasoning to <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/feb/24/the-40-yard-dash-has-a-long-history-behind-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Commercial Appeal</a>:
<blockquote>[Head Coach Paul Brown] did it as a way of deciding which players to keep, but we decided, "Why not get them to run a 40 before we have them in camp?" Some of it also had to do then with deciding who you switched over to defense, which is always where you wanted your fastest players.</blockquote>
And there you have it. Without further adieu, here are the fastest standardized 40 times in the NFL. (The league switched to electronic timing in 2000.)<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Justin King, CB (2008); Johnathan Joseph, CB (2006); Tyvon Branch, CB (2008); Keith Marshall, TB (2016) – 4.31 seconds [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_514706" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514706" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Johnathan-Joseph-Getty-Images-Scott-Halleran.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="504" /> Johnathan Joseph | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Shout out to the Minutemen, we have a three-way tie for last. And all three of them are cornerbacks (fancy that). Like Brant mentioned, the fastest NFL players tend to wind up on defense. It makes sense, if you figure that the guys trying to keep the other team from scoring should probably be able to get to the guy with the ball as quickly as possible.

So who were these players? The Cincinnati Bengals drafted Johnathan Joseph with the 24th pick in 2006. A two-time Pro Bowler, Joseph went to the Houston Texans in free agency. He signed a five-year deal with the club, which began in 2011. The St. Louis Rams, meanwhile, took Justin King in the fourth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played for the Rams, Colts, and Steelers, his last club, which waived him in 2013 after placing him on the IR list.<!--nextpage-->

The Oakland Raiders selected Tyvon Branch in the fourth round of the 2008 draft, and he played strong safety before joining the Kansas City Chiefs. KC franchised Branch in 2012; he only appeared in two games during the 2013 season before he suffered a fractured fibia. Unsurprisingly, the Raiders safety was also a track star.

The 2016 NFL Combine saw one participant make this list; Georgia's Keith Marshall clocked a blazing 4.31 in his 40-yard dash time (it was unofficially marked as 4.28, which would have tied him with the notables below.<span class="s1">) </span>Either way, a strong showing means the future is bright for this senior running back, who was somewhat overlooked prior to this mark.

<h2 style="text-align: left"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">6. Tye Hill, CB (2006); Darrius Heyward-Bey, WR (2009); Yamon Figurs, WR (2007) – </strong><strong>4.30 seconds [tie]</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_514715" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514715" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DHB-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="467" /> Darrius Heyward-Bey | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Let’s get one thing clear about now-deceased Hall of Fame Raiders owner/general manager/icon Al Davis: He loved speed; he loved fast players; he loved drafting fast players. So when Darrius Heyward-Bey (pictured) ran a 4.30 at the 2009 NFL Draft Combine, Davis responded by taking the receiver, a track star in high school (sound familiar?), with the seventh overall pick. That was, by most people’s estimations, way too high. Oh well. Now with the Pittsburg Steelers, Heyward-Bey starred in a <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2013/08/15/darris-heyward-bey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great MMQB article</a> a couple seasons ago.

The St. Louis Rams chose Tye Hill, who played from 2006<span class="s1">–</span>10, in the first round of the draft. He would later go on to play for the Tennessee Titans, Detroit Lions, and Atlanta Falcons, only catching on for more than one year in St. Louis. His was the fastest 40-yard dash at the 2006 draft combine.

Yamon Figurs also played his last game in the NFL during the 2010 season, after tearing his ACL during his rookie campaign with the Baltimore Ravens. He ended up with the Detroit Lions, the Tampa Bay Bucs, the Oakland Raiders, the Cleveland Browns, and the Tennessee Titans before entering the Canadian Football league, where he remained for one season with the Edmonton Eskimos.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>5. DeMarcus Van Dyke, CB (2011); Jacoby Ford, WR (2010) – 4.28 seconds [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_514716" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514716" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DMVD-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> DeMarcus Van Dyke | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

DeMarcus Van Dyke was also drafted by the Oakland Raiders, in the third round of the 2011 draft. That draft was owner/GM Davis’s last, as he passed away that October (the draft traditionally takes place in late April). Van Dyke did not see much playing time with Oakland and was released in 2012, when he caught on with the Pittsburg Steelers, who waived him after he suffered a hamstring injury.<!--nextpage-->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UK32OXBi28"></iframe>
Jacoby Ford, a super-speedy wide receiver, ran a 4.28 40-yard dash and was drafted by -- stop me if this is getting familiar -- the Oakland Raiders with a more reasonable 101st pick. Ford was even faster than Heyward-Bey (the unofficial gold standard for “Al Davis will draft anyone who was faster than anyone else”), posting his 40-yard dash time in 2010. He played with the team for four seasons, until the franchise did not offer him a new contract in 2014. Ford is currently playing with the Titans, and you can see footage of his 40-yard dash above.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Marquise Goodwin, WR (2013) – 4.27 seconds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_514718" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514718" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Marquise-Rick-Stewart-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="568" /> Marquise Goodwin | Rick Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

That’s correct: The third-fastest NFL 40-yard dash came as recently as 2013. Marquise Goodwin, a multi-sport athlete at Texas, put down a scorching 4.27 time at the 2013 NFL combine. The wide receiver, who played in 12 games last year, including one start, tallied a grand total of 17 receptions. He was able to make them count, though, as Goodwin averaged 16.6 yards per catch on his way to three touchdowns.

Unfortunately, Goodwin’s rookie season didn’t do much to help the Bills, as they finished 6-10 and missed the playoffs for the 14th consecutive season. The next year was better, though, and Goodwin and the rest of the roster will look to grow together with Buffalo in the future.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Dri Archer, RB (2014) — 4.26 seconds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_514719" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514719" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DA-Sam-Greenwood-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="470" /> Dri Archer | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

That’s also correct: History was almost made at the 2014 NFL Draft Combine, as Dri Archer came very, very close to breaking the combine record, which we’ll get to shortly. A running back out of Kent State, Archer wasn’t a highly touted prospect before his combine showing, which definitely opened some eyes.

After all, a 4.26 40-yard dash is fast. Real fast. Archer was eventually drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round of the 2014 NFL Draft and was a relative nonentity during his rookie season, reflecting on his mixed-bag scouting reports before the draft.

“Outstanding burst, acceleration and top-end speed to take the corner and create big plays,” said <a href="http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/dri-archer?id=2543596" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL.com’s scouting report</a>. ”Extremely strong pound-for-pound.” So far, so good. Sounds like a good prospect. But then: “Very short and rail thin with no strength or running power. Not a tackle-breaker and goes down easy on contact,” the report continues. “Limited inside runner. Can be knocked off routes easily and struggles catching on contact.”

<h2>2. Chris Johnson, RB (2008) – 4.24 seconds</h2>
[caption id="attachment_514720" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-514720" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Chris-Johnson-Frederick-Breedon-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes in NFL History" width="757" height="617" /> Chris Johnson | Frederick Breedon/Getty Images[/caption]

The (second) fastest electronically clocked player in NFL combine history, Chris Johnson, nicknamed CJ2K after his 2,000-yard rushing campaign in 2009  -- and later, after his return to earth, sarcastically referred to as CJ2YPC at two yards per carry -- may have  been the fastest player in the NFL.

<i></i>After struggling to live up to his incredible 2009 season, Johnson, who has struggled behind a sometimes porous offensive line, managed to rack up 1,077 yards in 2013. CJ2K, who had never run for fewer than 1,000 yards until his seventh year in the league, was drafted in the first round by the Tennessee Titans (higher than he was projected to go before the combine).

Johnson has run the season-highest single gain in two NFL seasons, running for 91 yards in 2009 and 94 yards in 2012, and until 2015 he had never missed more than one game in his NFL career. You can check out his record-setting 40-yard dash above.

<h2>1. John Ross, WR (2017) - 4.22 Seconds</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLv_GHnyLPU"></iframe>
Chris Johnson held the 40-yard dash record, for almost a decade, but  during the 2017 NFL Combine, University of Washington receiver John Ross blew everyone out of the water and set a new record of 4.22 seconds. Check out the video above, and realize that Ross was unofficially clocked at 4.18 -- which would put him within a respectable distance of Bo Jackson's legendary (and unofficial) 4.13.

Beyond his blazing speed: (<a href="http://walterfootball.com/scoutingreport2017jross.php">Walter Football</a> has him listed as "extremely fast" in their scouting report because,yeah, he's very very fast) Ross grades out about as well as any average-sized wideout could hope for, and he could potentially be the wide receiver to be picked in the 2017 NFL Draft.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_609602" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-609602" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Joey-Bosa-NFL-Combine-Day-5-gsian113mPrl.jpg" alt="Joey Bosa shows off at the NFL Combine" width="757" height="505" /> Joey Bosa shows off at the NFL Combine. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

The time-honored cliches, "speed kills" and "you can’t coach speed," are true. The fastest NFL players can shred <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-defenses-2016-17.html/">the perfect defense</a> and go the distance on any given play. Opposing teams must account for these electric performers at all times. This extra attention creates space for all offensive personnel <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-offenses-2016-17.html/">to go to work</a>.

On the other side of the football, speedsters can play lock-down, man-to-man defense and chase down plays from the weak-side across the formation. A real burner will put in spot duty on special teams as a return man when the team needs a spark. Football speed, in pads, is different than straightaway speed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/12-fastest-40-yard-dashes-in-nfl-history.html/">measured with a stopwatch</a> on a fast track.

Even the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-wide-receivers-of-all-time.html/">great Jerry Rice</a> ran a rather pedestrian 4.71 40-yard dash. On game day, however, he flashed wide open on drag routes across the middle before hauling in the football, turning the corner, and racing upfield past the defense for six. Alternatively, Darrius Heyward-Bey's professional career never got off the ground despite literally breaking stopwatches at the NFL combine. The following current NFL players represent the ideal combination of lateral quickness, acceleration, agility, and raw top-line speed.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Julio Jones</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_607677" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607677" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Julio-Jones_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-638x500.jpg" alt="The 5 Fastest NFL Players Who Are Currently Active" width="757" height="593" /> Wide receiver Julio Jones is one of the most physically gifted, fastest NFL players in the league | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

This is (almost) unfair. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-nfl-players-2016.html/">Julio Jones</a> measures out at six-foot-three and 217 pounds -- and he is bigger than Adrian Peterson. At the combine, Jones clocked in at 4.39 in the 40-yard dash as the most physically gifted wide receiver to enter the draft <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-100-career-touchdown-receptions.html/">since Randy Moss</a>. Yes, Jones is faster than Antonio Brown and Odell Beckam, Jr., who are both burners in their own right.

The 27-year-old is a matchup nightmare. As a possession receiver, Jones can use his big body to wall off defenders on slants and quick outs right at the sticks. On wide receiver screens, he will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-receiving-yards-leaders-odds.html/">haul in the pass</a>, before throwing out a stiff-arm on the defensive back and racing down the sidelines. In response, defensive coordinators will often call for Cover 2, with a corner cheating up toward the line of scrimmage being backed up with safety help over the top.

Still, Jones <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/11-most-irreplaceable-players-in-the-nfl.html/">can easily outrun</a> this double coverage before quarterback Matt Ryan drops in a deep bomb. For his career, he is averaging 15.1 yards per catch as the ultimate big-play threat. Last year, Jones led the league in both receptions (136) and yards (1,871). Ironically, the top-end speed was on full display when he found himself as a defender, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-KYDRukAhA">chasing</a> Tampa Bay linebacker Kwon Alexander 85 yards downfield to stop a pick-six.

<h2><strong>4. DeSean Jackson</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_555088" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-555088" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DeSean-Jackson_Rob-Carr_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Fastest NFL Players Who Are Currently Active" width="757" height="396" /> Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson celebrates a touchdown | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

At 30 years old, DeSean Jackson is still one of the fastest men in the NFL. He ran a 4.35 in the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. Then the Philadelphia Eagles picked him in the 2008 draft. Jackson was at his best in 2010, when he paired up with a reinvigorated Michael Vick to torch the competition. That year, Jackson came down with 47 receptions for 1,056 yards -- a blistering 22.5 yards-per-catch average.

For the play of the year, Jackson actually muffed a punt against the New York Giants, before picking the football back up at his own 25. From there, he drifted to his right, before feinting back to the left and turning on the jets upfield. After shaking two tacklers and hurtling over the punter, Jackson got a block and turned on another gear at the 50-yard line. From there, he was so far behind the Giants coverage that he actually tiptoed horizontally alongside the goal-line to run out the clock before scoring the touchdown.

The Philadelphia Eagles won this game 38-31. A irate Tom Coughlin screamed at punter Matt Dodge for actually kicking the football to Jackson. Matt Dodge found himself out of a job immediately thereafter. For his career, Jackson has averaged 18 yards per catch to go with 50 total touchdowns, as a receiver, on the ground, and in the return game. For 2016, Jackson will have another big year in Washington, if Kirk Cousins <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-players-decline-2016.html/">can get him the football</a>.

<h2><strong>3. Brandin Cooks</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_557779" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-557779 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Brandin-Cooks_Chris-Graythen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Fastest NFL Players Who Are Currently Active" width="757" height="551" /> New Orleans Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks poses for the crowd | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

Brandin Cooks is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rising-stars-nfc.html/">one of the more underrated</a> and least recognized burners in the NFL. Cooks played his college ball at Oregon State, in the shadows of the Mighty Ducks of the Pacific Northwest. Now, Cooks finds himself in another small market. His Saints club that hasn't made the playoffs through his first two seasons. Still, Cooks is only 23; he has plenty of time to play pitch-and-catch with Drew Brees on the Superdome fast track -- and introduce himself to fans.

Cooks is often compared against Rams wideout Tavon Austin in terms of both speed and stature. On paper, both of these athletes measure out near 5-foot-9 and 180 pounds and run a sub-4.35 40-yard dash. In real time, however, Cooks does <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-fantasy-football-player-nfc.html/">show better acceleration</a>; he is one shade quicker in and out of his breaks as a route runner.

For this, Cooks hauled in 84 receptions for 1,138 yards and nine touchdowns last season, while obliterating concerns that he was a one-dimensional speedster. For Week 1 this year, Drew Brees hit Cooks in stride from the back of his own end-zone. Cooks then sprinted down the sideline and celebrated capping  off the 98-yard pass play in front of a raucous New Orleans crowd.

<h2><strong>2. Patrick Peterson</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_536012" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-536012" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Patrick-Peterson-640x448.jpg" alt="The 5 Fastest NFL Players Who Are Currently Active" width="757" height="530" /> Cornerback Patrick Peterson is a speed demon for the Arizona Cardinals | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/st-patricks-day-the-5-best-athletes-ever-named-patrick.html/">Patrick</a> Peterson is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-best-cornerbacks-in-the-league-today.html/">closest thing to Deion Sanders</a> we can get. Peterson already admitted to modeling his game after Sanders, right down to the high-stepping and flashy touchdown celebrations. For a more direct comparison, he may be one small step slower than Deion. However, he is a much more physical presence and willing tackler out on the edge. Either way, both Peterson and Deion Sanders were ready for Prime Time, after clocking at 4.34 and 4.27 in the 40-yard dash, respectively. Peterson is at his best in press coverage, when he will line up directly across from the other team’s best receiver and track him all over the field, with no safety help over the top.

Last year, in Week 6, Peterson limited the flashy Antonio Brown to only three catches for 24 yards. Taken together, Peterson and the Honey Badger form the best secondary in football this side of Seattle. These two already combine for 27 interceptions and six return touchdowns well before the age of 30.

The Cards have one of the best defenses in the league again. Jones is pressuring the quarterback off the edge and Peterson is jumping hot routes out in the flat. He will remain in the game to field punts after harassing the opposing offense into yet another three-and-out. In the return game, Peterson will set up his blocks beautifully, before weaving in and out of traffic and hitting the turbo button to daylight.

<h2><strong>1. Ted Ginn Jr.</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_602210" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-602210" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Ted-Ginn-Jr_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-640x439.jpg" alt="The 5 Fastest NFL Players Who Are Currently Active" width="757" height="519" /> Ted Ginn Jr. makes a run for it | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Ted Ginn Jr. would have emerged as the latest track-and-field star, if it were not for football. In high school, he won the state title in 200 meters and the national championship in the 110-meter hurdles. As a high school senior, Ginn did clock out at 10.2 in the 100-meter dash, which was already then a mere four-tenths of a second off the record pace of Usain Bolt. Ohio State actually recruited Ginn to run track. Then coach Russ Rogers believed that the Cleveland product had a chance to make the 2008 Olympics. Ginn, of course, dedicated himself to football instead.

As a Buckeye, Ginn kicked off the 2007 BCS National Championship Game by taking the opening kickoff 92 yards to the house against Tim Tebow and the Florida Gators. Ginn, however, sprained his foot beneath the dog-pile in this wild celebration and still wore a cast through the ensuing NFL combine in Indianapolis. If not for this freak injury, Ginn was all but set to run a sub 4.3 40-yard and challenge the combine record. Still, he went to the Miami Dolphins as the ninth overall pick in the 2007 draft. For his second year, Ginn had racked up 56 catches for 790 yards, before landing in San Francisco.

As a 49er Ginn was well behind Michael Crabtree, Mario Manningham, and even a 35-year-old Randy Moss on the wide-receiver depth chart, while also competing with Vernon Davis for touches. As a return man, Ginn took three touchdowns to the house through three years in San Francisco. He is at <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-bold-predictions-for-the-carolina-panthers-in-2016.html/">his best in Carolina</a>, where he is the primary deep threat for Cam Newton. Ginn has already carved out a 10-year career for himself as the fastest man in the NFL.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_574670" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574670" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cowboys-Ring-of-Honor-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The ring of honor displays the names of the Dallas Cowboys' Michael Irvin, Troy Aikman, and Emmitt Smith at Texas Stadium. " width="757" height="504" /> The ring of honor displays the names of the Dallas Cowboys' Michael Irvin, Troy Aikman, and Emmitt Smith at Texas Stadium. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The Dallas Cowboys, nicknamed “America’s Team,” may be the most popular <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a> franchise in the world. They have made 30 playoff appearances, won eight NFC titles and been Super Bowl champions five times. Founded in 1960, the Cowboys have had 11 players inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

In 2014, former legendary Cowboys quarterback <a title="Tony Romo, Jason Witten" href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/11668439/tony-romo-says-jason-witten-best-dallas-cowboys-player-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Romo suggested</a> that his long-time favorite target, tight end Jason Witten, might be the “best Dallas Cowboy of all time.” People have hotly debated this statement ever since. It got us thinking: Does Witten even crack the top 10 best Dallas Cowboys players of all time?

To make a top 10 greatest Dallas Cowboys of all time list, you already have to leave off at least one Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee. When you throw Witten and other current players into the mix, things get more convoluted. In compiling this list, we considered statistics, All-Pro selections, team success, and longevity (sorry, Deion Sanders). Here is a look at the top 10 best Dallas Cowboys players ever.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. <strong>Jason Witten</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574627" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574627" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jason-Witten-Mike-Stone-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jason Witten looks to make the grab." width="757" height="583" /> Jason Witten looks to make the grab. | Mike Stone/Getty Images[/caption]

This spot came down to Witten and DeMarcus Ware. Had Ware finished his career with the Cowboys, he may have received the nod here. But you simply cannot ignore Witten’s statistics (<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WittJa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,020 receptions, 11,215 yards, 60 touchdown catches</a>), longevity (13 seasons) with the franchise, and overall consistency throughout his career. Witten remains one of the premier tight ends in today’s game, and unlike some of the other elite tight ends in the NFL today, he takes great pride in his blocking ability.

<h2>9. Tony Dorsett<strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574638" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574638" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tony-Dorsett-Paul-Hawthorne-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tony Dorsett attends the Great Sports Legends Dinner honoring sports legends." width="757" height="522" /> Tony Dorsett attends the Great Sports Legends Dinner honoring sports legends. | Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images for The Miami Project[/caption]

The Cowboys selected Dorsett with the second overall pick in the 1977 NFL Draft and proved to be a great selection. Dorsett played 11 years in Dallas (and one season in Denver), <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DorsTo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rushing for a total of 12,739 yards and 72 touchdowns</a>, and catching 382 passes for 3,432 yards and 13 touchdowns for his career. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, selected to four Pro Bowls and three All-Pro teams, won the 1977 Offensive Rookie of the Year award and helped lead the Cowboys to a Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl XII.

<h2>8. Michael Irvin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574643" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574643" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Michael-Irvin-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Irvin addressing the media." width="757" height="496" /> Michael Irvin addressing the media. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Irvin earned his nickname the “Playmaker” for good reason during his 12 seasons as a Cowboy. During the Cowboys' dominant run of the 1990s, Irvin was arguably the best wide receiver in pro football. During that time, the Cowboys won three Super Bowl titles and Irvin racked up three All-Pro selections while catching 750 passes for 11,904 yards and 65 touchdowns. The “Playmaker” is also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>7. Troy Aikman<strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574645" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574645" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Troy-Aikman-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Troy Aikman answers questions from the press during a FOX Sports media event." width="757" height="504" /> Troy Aikman answers questions from the press during a FOX Sports media event. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Aikman’s statistics do not justify his place on this list, but his contributions and role in possibly the most dominant dynasty of the last 25 years certainly do. The number one overall selection in the 1989 NFL Draft played 12 seasons for the Cowboys and retired as the franchise leader in passing yardage with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AikmTr00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">32,942 yards</a>. More importantly, Aikman quarterbacked the Cowboys to three Super Bowl championships earning six Pro Bowl Selections and 1993 All-Pro honors along the way. In 2006, Aikman entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>6. Larry Allen<strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574646" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574646" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Larry-Allen-Robert-B.-Stanton-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="49ers defensive end Marques Douglas is stopped at the line by Dallas guard Larry Allen." width="757" height="597" /> You can't get by Larry Allen. | Robert B. Stanton/NFLPhotoLibrary/Getty Images[/caption]

Allen is among the best interior offensive linemen to ever play the game of football. He opened holes for the running back with the most rushing yards in NFL history and protected a Hall of Fame quarterback. The 2013 Hall of Fame inductee participated in the Cowboys’ Super Bowl XXX winning team and joined 11 Pro Bowls and seven All-Pro teams.

<h2>5. Mel Renfro</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574652" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574652" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mel-Renfo-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys great Mel Renfro on the sidelines during a Monday Night Football game." width="757" height="492" /> Mel Renfro stands on the sidelines during a Monday Night Football game. | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Renfro was a highly decorated offensive player in college. Then Cowboys’ coach Tom Landry saw something in him and surprisingly moved him to the defensive side of the ball. The move paid off big time. Renfro helped the Cowboys win two Super Bowl titles; he participated in 10 Pro Bowls and five All-Pro teams; and he entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

<h2>4. <strong>Randy White</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574656" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574656" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Randy-White-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Randy White stands on the sidelines during a Monday Night Football game." width="757" height="492" /> Randy White stands on the sidelines during a Monday Night Football game. | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

White was a dominating defensive force for the Cowboys during his 14 years in Dallas. Originally drafted as a linebacker, White moved to defensive tackle after his first two seasons and developed into the Hall of Fame player everyone now remembers. The “Manster,” as teammates knew him, totaled 52.5 sacks in his career to go with nine Pro Bowl selections and nine first-team All-Pro selections. He helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XII where he received Co-Super Bowl MVP honors.

<h2>3. Bob Lilly<strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_574658" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574658" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cowboys-Helmet-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="A Dallas Cowboys helmet " width="757" height="495" /> A Dallas Cowboys helmet | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Lilly was the best player on the notoriously dominant “Doomsday Defense” of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1960s–1970s. Lilly was nearly un-blockable in his 14 seasons as a Cowboy and helped lead them to victory in Super Bowl VI. The 1980 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee was selected to 11 Pro Bowls, nine All-Pro teams, and had 94.5 sacks in his career.

<h2>2. Emmitt Smith</h2>

It’s hard to imagine that the NFL’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_career.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time rushing yardage leader</a> is the product of the Cowboys’ system. However, that’s exactly what Smith’s critics will tell you. It’s no coincidence that the 2010 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee put up the numbers that he did in his 13 years with the Cowboys. Smith was consistent, broke a lot of tackles, was deceptively fast, and rarely missed a game. That’s how he ran for 17,162 yards and 153 touchdowns in his Cowboys career. Smith was selected to eight Pro Bowls, five All-Pro teams, and led the NFL in rushing four times. He participated in three Super Bowl-winning Cowboys squads and received Super Bowl XXVIII MVP honors.

<h2>1. Roger Staubach</h2>
<img class="wp-image-550940 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Roger-Staubach-Elsa-Getty-Images-e1438117457510.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Roger “the Dodger” Staubach comes in as the best player in Cowboys history. Staubach led the Cowboys to two Super Bowl titles and five NFC Championships. The 1971 NFL MVP was a six-time Pro Bowl selection and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee in 1985. At the time of his retirement, Staubach was the second highest rated passer of all time with a career quarterback rating of 83.4. Staubach became known for his sometimes wild playing style and his knack for leading the Cowboys to improbable comeback wins.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_688699" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-688699" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Barry-Sanders-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Barry Sanders is a true Hall of Famer | Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="582" /> Barry Sanders is a true Hall of Famer | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

In the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a>, as in everything, there are the good players, the bad players, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-greatest-nfl-players-of-all-%C2%ADtime.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the greatest players</a> to ever step foot on the gridiron. Tasked with rushing the football and receiving passes out of the backfield, the greatest NFL running backs move the chains, break big plays, and help the team win ball games. The position demands a total package of vision, toughness, durability, fiery leadership, and above all else, pure running ability.

The best runs often combine a smooth mix of shiftiness, acceleration, power, and top-line speed. The top 17 greatest NFL running backs of all time put everything together -- with astounding consistency.

<h2>17. Curtis Martin</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Curtis-Martin-HENNY-RAY-ABRAMS-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Curtis Martin (L) can handle the pressure | HENNY RAY ABRAMS/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="592" /> Curtis Martin (L) can handle the pressure | Henny Ray Abrams/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Taken in the third round (No. 74 overall) in the 1995 draft, Curtis Martin accomplished plenty during his time as a member of both the New England Patriots and New York Jets. In 11 NFL seasons, Martin <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MartCu00.htm">rushed for 14,101 yards</a> and 90 rushing scores, earned five trips to the Pro Bowl, and was named a First-Team All-Pro during the 2004 season. For his efforts, Martin was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012

<h2>16. Franco Harris</h2>
[caption id="attachment_739196" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-739196" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Franco-Harris-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images-585x500.jpg" alt="Franco Harris was a star for the Steelers | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="757" height="647" /> Franco Harris was a star for the Steelers. | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

While Franco Harris spent 13 seasons in the National Football League, he's most remembered for the 12 years -- four of which resulted in Super Bowl wins -- he spent running the pigskin for the Pittsburgh Steelers. During Harris' Hall of Fame career, he averaged 70.1 rushing yards per game, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarrFr00.htm">amassed 12,120 yards and 91 touchdowns on the ground</a>, was named First-Team All-Pro in 1977, and earned nine trips to the Pro Bowl. To this day, his "Immaculate Reception" against the Oakland Raiders remains one of the most iconic plays in NFL history.

<h2>15. Terrell Davis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658060" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658060" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Terrell-Davis_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images-2-640x427.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Terrell Davis runs the ball for the Broncos | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite only playing seven seasons, Terrell Davis more than earned his place on the list of greatest NFL running backs. The former Denver Broncos superstar amassed 7,607 rushing yards and 60 rushing touchdowns, earned three trips to the Pro Bowl, and was a three-time First-Team All-Pro. T.D. also won two Super Bowls, was the Super Bowl MVP in 1997, and was named the Most Valuable Player during the 2008 season. Not bad for a guy who wasn't selected until the sixth round (No. 196 overall) of the 1995 draft.

<h2>14. Marshall Faulk</h2>
[caption id="attachment_738852" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-738852" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Marshall-Faulk-SCOTT-ROVAK-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" width="757" height="613" /> Marshall Faulk #28 is one of a kind | Scott Rovak/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

During his 12 NFL seasons (five with the Colts and seven with the Rams), Marshall Faulk became one of the most complete backs the game has ever seen. The Hall of Famer rushed for 12,279 yards and 100 rushing touchdowns while also amassing <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FaulMa00.htm">6,875 receiving yards</a> and 36 touchdown receptions. Faulk dazzled as a member of the "Greatest Show on Turf" and finished his career with one Super Bowl victory, one MVP award, seven trips to the Pro Bowl, and three First-Team All-Pro selections.

<h2>13. Marcus Allen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713870" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713870" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Marcus-Allen-David-Maxwell-Getty-Images-640x419.jpg" alt="Marcus Allen is a Hall of Famer | David Maxwell/Getty Images" width="757" height="496" /> Marcus Allen is a Hall of Famer | David Maxwell/Getty Images[/caption]

After being selected out of USC with the No. 10 overall pick in the 1982 draft, Marcus Allen provided football fans with 16 seasons of beautiful running back play. The Hall of Famer averaged 4.1 yards per carry, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AlleMa00.htm">rushed for 123 touchdowns</a>, and picked up 12,243 yards on the ground. For good measure, Allen also amassed 5,411 receiving yards and caught 21 touchdowns. Just a few of the many reasons why he was selected to six Pro Bowl teams, named First-Team All-Pro twice, and took home the 1985 MVP award.

<h2>12. Earl Campbell</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7DKVvw6XYA"></iframe>

Earl Campbell burst onto the scene in 1978 and immediately overpowered the rest of the National Football League. In his first three seasons, Campbell <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CampEa00.htm">led the league in rushing yards and yards per game</a>, while finishing with the most rushing scores in two out of three of those years (1979 and 1980). By the time he called it a career, the Hall of Fame back was a league MVP, a five-time Pro Bowler, and a three-time First-Team All-Pro. It's safe to say they don't make them like Earl Campbell anymore.

<h2>11. Thurman Thomas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752053" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752053" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Thurman-Thomas-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="498" /> Thurman Thomas plows through a hole in the Chicago Bears defense | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

If you didn’t know, Thurman Thomas kept Barry Sanders on the bench as a back up at Oklahoma State University. In the NFL, Thurman Thomas went on to star as one of the greatest all-purpose running backs of all time. His legacy, however, will be forever marred by the inability of his Buffalo Bills to actually win the Super Bowl – after four straight trips to the Big Game.

For example, Thomas was the clear cut MVP of “wide right" Super Bowl XXV versus the New York Giants – <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199101270buf.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 135 yards rushing on 15 carries to go along with 55 yards receiving</a>. Before his retirement, Thurman Thomas had set NFL postseason records for career points (126), touchdowns (21), and receptions by a running back in one game (13).

<h2>10. Gayle Sayers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752079" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752079" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gayle-Sayers-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="567" /> Gayle Sayers (R) on the field with Dick Butkus | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

The Kansas Comet was notable for his electric running style that showcased remarkable balance, shifts, feints, and unparalleled acceleration. In 1965, the Chicago Bears drafted Gale Sayers as the fourth overall pick out of Kansas University.

That year, Sayers immediately took the League by storm, as he scampered for a then record 22 NFL touchdowns upon 2,272 all-purpose yards, which then also set a rookie record. Pundits have often highlighted <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nfl-rookie-gale-sayers-ties-single-game-td-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sayers’ 6-touchdown effort</a> to lead the Chicago Bears to a 61-20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers as the greatest individual effort in the history of the game.

The 6-foot, 200 pound back was to lead the NFL in rushing in both 1966 and 1969 – with 1,231 and 1032 yards over 14 game seasons. Sayers <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SayeGa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also averaged </a>a staggering 5.2, 5.4, 4.7, and 6.2 yards per carry during his first four seasons. A runner, Sayers was always a threat to score on hand-offs, flare passes out of the backfield, and even as a return man in the kicking game.

<h2>9. Adrian Peterson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675734" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675734" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adrian-Peterson_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Adrian Peterson is already one of the greats | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Adrian Peterson hasn't hung up his helmet, yet the four-time First-Team All-Pro has already established himself as one of the greatest running backs in the history of the game. Since coming into the league in 2007, All Day has led the NFL in rushing three times, compiled 97 rushing touchdowns, won an MVP award, and been to seven Pro Bowls. When he finally decides to walk away from the game, you can expect Peterson will be much higher on the list.

<h2>8. Tony Dorsett</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752102" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752102" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Toni-Dorsett-Ken-Levine-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="504" /> Tony Dorsett between plays with the Dallas Cowboys | Ken Levine/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1977, Tony Dorsett entered the NFL as a Dallas Cowboy and the second overall draft pick, after starring for Pittsburgh University and <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/pitt-dorsett.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shattering the NCAA Football rushing record</a> (later broken by Ricky Williams and Ron Dayne). From there, he was named the starting running back for America’s Team after his 10th game, and spent the next decade as a stalwart for Dallas.

Topping the all-important 1,000-yard mark in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DorsTo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eight of his first nine seasons</a>, and rushing for 745 yards during the nine-game strike-shortened 1982 season, Dorsett upped the ante in the postseason with 1,383 yards rushing, which translated into his 4.6 yards per carry average over 17 NFL Playoff games. In Super Bowl XII, Dorsett rushed for 66 yards on 15 carries to help his Dallas Cowboys defeat the Denver Broncos 27-10.

<h2>7. O.J. Simpson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752130" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752130" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/OJ-Pool-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="503" /> Unfortunately, O.J.'s most enduring legacy came out of the court room | Pool/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Orenthal James “O.J." Simpson was actually a top shelf running back prior to the Nicole Simpson/Ronald Goldman murders, 405 Freeway police chase, and multiple felony convictions.

Simpson may best be described as a late NFL bloomer. In 1969, The Buffalo Bills drafted The Juice as the first overall pick after he dominated the college game at USC to claim the Heisman Trophy. The prior year, in 1968, the franchise had gone 1-12-1, and it actually took three years before the Bills’ offensive line, known as the Power Company, was really able to turn on The Juice.

Simpson did not break the 1,000-yard mark <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SimpO.00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">until his fourth season</a>. That year, O.J. claimed the NFL rushing title – with 1,251 yards rushing and 6 touchdowns in fourteen games of action.

In 1973, Simpson put together the greatest individual season of any running back. In 14 games, O.J. racked up 2,003 rushing yards upon 332 carries, which also calculated out to 6 yards per carry and 143 yards rushing per game. These totals would project out to 2,288 yards during the course of a 16-game regular season.

<h2>6. LaDainian Tomlinson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_752141" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-752141" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LT-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="504" /> L.T. might be the best modern back to never have much playoff success | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

LaDainian Tomlinson was the most complete back of his era. Standing at 5-foot-10 and weighing in at 221 pounds, he had all the tools to run for speed, power, and move the football inside and outside of the tackles. Tomlinson, of course, was also a threat to catch the ball out of the backfield and even split out wide of the formation in space as a receiver. L.T. has also thrown for 7 touchdowns and a 154.4 passer rating over his eight-year career.

Tomlinson now ranks fifth in NFL career yards from scrimmage <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/yds_from_scrimmage_career.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with 18,456</a>. Tomlinson rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his first eight seasons in the league, two rushing titles, as well as a 2003 campaign when he racked up 2,370 yards from scrimmage. For added measure, Tomlinson also took home the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in 2006.

Similar to Thurman Thomas, Tomlinson’s career legacy will be forever marred by his inability to win The Big One. L.T. never made it to the Super Bowl, despite being surrounded with Pro Bowl talent in San Diego through his prime years.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Eric Dickerson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_678151" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-678151" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Eric-Dickerson-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="510" /> After his retirement, Eric Dickerson relaxes | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

Eric Dickerson was arguably the best pure, straight-line runner in NFL history. Measuring out at 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, Dickerson was noticeably taller than the conventional running back. He was always just a few gallops away from top speed, and after clearing the line-of-scrimmage, Dickerson and his long strides would race up the sidelines and eat up yardage.

Dickerson immediately took the NFL by storm – out of SMU. In 1983, Dickerson put together the greatest rookie season up to that point, behind 1,808 yards rushing. Dickerson’s 2,105-yard effort from 1984 still stands as <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_single_season.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the single-season rushing record</a>. After seven straight seasons, Dickerson was to emerge as the fastest player ever to cross over the 10,000-yard benchmark, and he still lays claim to three of the top 20 single-season rushing yardage performances in NFL history. When he retired, Dickerson left the game of football as the second leading rusher of all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Barry Sanders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719934" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719934" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Barry-Sanders-Matt-Campbell-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="676" /> In his prime, Barry Sanders was on of the greatest running backs ever | Matt Campbell/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Barry Sanders contorted his body in unthinkable positions, shimmied past linebackers, and broke the ankles of countless defensive backs to the tune of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SandBa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15,269 rushing yards over 10 seasons</a> – finishing a then second only to Walter Payton (Emmitt Smith went on to break NFL career rushing record with 18,355 yards) in terms of all-time yardage. Sanders rushed for over 1,000 yards every year during this span with a breath taking 5.0 yards per carry average.

The Detroit Lion earned Pro Bowl honors each season and won four rushing titles. In 1997, Sanders put it all together – to rack up 2053 rushing yards upon a gaudy 6.1 yards-per-carry average. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/06/sports/la-sp-sn-barry-sanders-20121206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">After the 1998 season</a>, he shocked the world and walk away from football in his prime.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Emmitt Smith</h2>
[caption id="attachment_726144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-726144" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Emmit-Smith-Paul-Buck-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="576" /> Making the Falcons' defense look awful, Emmitt Smith gains yardage | Paul Buck/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Emmitt Smith stood 5-foot-9 and weighed in at 221 pounds. Prior to entering the League, legions of scouts honed in upon Smith’s diminutive size and lack of speed, to dismiss his status as an NFL prospect. Again, Smith brought the intangibles of durability and heart to the table, in order to make up for his lack of classic NFL running back dimensions and flair. As a north-south rusher, Smith racked up yardage behind his sixth sense vision and mental toughness to finish off runs. Smith was there to move the chains in the fourth quarter, as he appeared to get stronger as the game wears on.

As a warrior, Smith started 219 out of the 226 games in which he appeared, rarely missed games due to injury, and never took any plays off. For Smith, this lunch pail mentality translated into 11 consecutive 1,000+ yard seasons <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SmitEm00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and 175 career touchdowns</a>, as well as the NFL career rushing yards title – with 18,355 yards.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Walter Payton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710107" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710107" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/walterpayton-e1412968427728.png" width="757" height="504" /> You know you're a big deal when you're on the front of a Wheaties Box | Tim Boyle/Getty Images[/caption]

Walter Payton ran between the tackles, outside on pitches and sweeps, blocked effectively, and was even a threat to pass. Payton <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished his playing career</a> with 16,726 rushing yards, 110 touchdowns, one MVP Award, and one ’85 Bears Super Bowl Shuffle ring. A testament to his toughness, Sweetness missed only one game over his thirteen-year career.

Walter Payton was never a speed demon. Instead, Sweetness racked up yardage through sheer tenacity and the mastery of an assortment of moves. Payton’s workmanlike mentality punished tacklers with stiff arms, explosive spin moves, and a refusal to escape to the sidelines prior to dropping his pads, bringing the pain, and fighting for every last inch.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Jim Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710118" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710118" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jimbrown-e1412968730588.png" width="757" height="759" /> The greatest of all time. 'Nuff said | Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

At 6-foot-2 and 232 pounds, Jim Brown was bigger, faster, stronger, and better than the competition. A man amongst boys, Brown was simply too strong to be taken down with arm tackles at the point-of-attack. Out on the edge, Brown’s agility would freeze linebackers, before he would deliver forearm shivers to overpower lightweight cornerbacks. From there, it would be off to the races, where No. 32 would blow past the last safety man and make his way into the end zone for six.

In all, Brown ran through, over, and around the opposition for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowJi00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a total of 12,312 yards and 106 touchdowns</a>. Brown claimed eight rushing titles during his nine-year career that spanned between 1957 and 1965. At 29, and in his prime, the headstrong Brown walked away from the NFL on his own accord, having owned every significant record applicable to any ball carrier.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_679126" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679126" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brett-Favre_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images-1024x800.jpg" alt="Joe Robbins/Getty Images" width="757" height="591" /> Brett Favre headlined the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2016 | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Earning a bronze bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is the highest honor <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-unbreakable-records.html/">an NFL player</a> can receive. In August, we saw eight new members immortalized during the Class of 2016 Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony. And we have a pretty good idea as to who the NFL Hall of Fame will honor in 2017.

We saw a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-retirements-2016.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handful of players retire</a> last offseason. And all of them have a place waiting for them in Canton, Ohio. (The Hall of Fame Class of 2021 may be the best ever, by the way.<span class="s1">) </span>But given the rules of the Selection Committee, each of them must wait a minimum of five years before becoming eligible for induction. This made us think about which current players are already locks to join the Pro Football Hall of Fame. After they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-couldnt-stay-retired.html/">hang up their cleats</a>, these 20 current players will become NFL Hall of Fame players.

<em>Note: We removed Steve Smith Sr. and Andre Johnson from consideration following their respective retirements. Both players are destined for the Hall of Fame.</em>

<h2>1. Ben Roethlisberger, QB, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587360" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587360" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ben-Roethlisberger_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1024x694.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="513" /> QB Ben Roethlisberger has already done enough to earn a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Ben Roethlisberger’s NFL career resume is already Hall of Fame-worthy. It will only continue to improve until the Pittsburgh Steelers signal caller hangs up his cleats and retires. At 34 years old, Big Ben may still have four or five Pro Bowl-caliber seasons ahead of him. With the team around him, Roethlisberger wouldn’t shock us if he wins another Super Bowl title (he has two already) before it’s all said and done.

Roethlisberger has a current career stat line that reads:
<ul>
 	<li>123 wins</li>
 	<li>64.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>46,814 passing yards</li>
 	<li>301 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>94.1 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>16 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>11 postseason wins</li>
 	<li>2 Super Bowl titles</li>
</ul>
Given that Pittsburgh has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pittsburgh-steelers-win-super-bowl.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arguably the best offense in the league</a>, we fully expect those numbers to grow substantially over the next couple of years. When Roethlisberger eventually retires he should have a strong case to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer.

<h2>2. Tom Brady, QB, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_671709" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-671709" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1-1024x668.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="494" /> Tom Brady will likely go down as the greatest quarterback in NFL history | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

In reality, this one needs no explanation. Tom Brady will likely go down as the greatest quarterback in NFL history when it’s all said and done. By the time he retires, he will probably hold almost every major passing record. Not to mention he is already the most successful postseason quarterback of all time. For the record, we are among those who believe Deflategate <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-new-england-patriots-biggest-scandals.html/">shouldn't taint his career</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Drew Brees, QB, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_541614" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-541614 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drew-Brees_Wesley-Hitt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="504" /> Quarterback Drew Brees already has a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame sewn up | Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]

Drew Brees is already <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/drew-brees-rank-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most accomplished quarterbacks</a> in NFL history. His 465 career touchdown passes are good for the third most of all time; his 66,111 passing yards are good for fourth most of all time; and his 131 career wins are good for the sixth most of all time. More importantly, Brees led the Saints to the Super Bowl XLIV title. During his 10-plus years in New Orleans he's helped transform a laughingstock franchise into a perennial contender in the NFC.

<h2>4. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_635542" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635542" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Aaron-Rodgers_Mike-McGinnis_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Mike McGinnis/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers has a gold jacket waiting for him | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

Bottom line, Aaron Rodgers is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-stats-greats.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best offensive player</a> in the NFL today. His statistical resume grows every year. And our guess is that the 33-year-old has enough gas left in his tank to play at least six more seasons at an All-Pro level. Rodgers already has a Super Bowl title to his name. He's won two NFL MVP awards. He also already holds multiple NFL records, including the highest career quarterback rating in league history (104.1).

<h2>5. Adrian Peterson, RB, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659241" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659241" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adrian-Peterson_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1-1024x724.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="535" /> Adrian Peterson has a chance to break the NFL career rushing yards record | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

"All Day" already proves to be one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/adrian-peterson-career-stats.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best pure runners</a> in NFL history. Despite being 31 years old, Adrian Peterson shows few signs of slowing down -- when he is healthy. The 2012 NFL MVP led the league in rushing yards in 2015, but missed the bulk of 2016 with a meniscus injury.

The former Oklahoma Sooner is currently No. 16 on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list and No. 10 on the league’s career rushing touchdowns list. If Peterson has another strong season in him (he is on track to be 100% healthy for the 2017 season), he will move past several players on each list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Brandon Marshall, WR, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_579356" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-579356" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brandon-Marshall_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-1024x672.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="497" /> Wide receiver Brandon Marshall has quietly put together a Hall of Fame-caliber resume | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Brandon Marshall may have caused his teammates, coaches, and general managers plenty of headaches throughout the years. However, this doesn’t change the fact that he has experienced a Hall of Fame-caliber NFL career. Marshall has already accumulated 941 receptions for 12,061 yards and 82 touchdowns.

Marshall had a down year (by his standards) in 2016, but given that he struggled to stay healthy and had to deal with the Jets' disastrous quarterback situation, we believe that he likely still has at least two or three more Pro Bowl seasons ahead of him. When the dust settles on six-time Pro Bowler's career, Marshall wouldn’t surprise us if he ends up in the top 10 in career receiving yards, career receptions, and career touchdown receptions.

<h2>7. Larry Fitzgerald, WR, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661870" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661870" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Larry-Fitzgerald_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Cardinals' Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best wideouts in NFL history | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Larry Fitzgerald is a bit of an ageless wonder. At the ripe age of 33-years-old, Fitzgerald led the NFL in receptions in 2016. And with his current resume, the 10-time Pro Bowler is well on his way to being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Fitzgerald has already hauled in 1,125 receptions for 14,389 yards and 104 touchdowns -- and will continue to add to those totals until he retires. What's even more remarkable about his production is that he played with mediocre quarterbacks for the majority of his career.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Terrell Suggs, OLB, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674525" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674525" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Terrell-Suggs_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Outside linebacker Terrell Suggs has a Hall of Fame resume | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Terrell Suggs has been causing opposing NFL offensive coordinators headaches for 14 years. The 2011 NFL Defensive Player of the Year has spent his entire career with the Baltimore Ravens, where he played a key role in the franchise's Super Bowl XLVII triumph over the San Francisco 49ers. In total, Suggs has been selected to six Pro Bowl rosters and two All-Pro teams, and has 114.5 career sacks.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Frank Gore, RB, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_561575" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-561575 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Frank-Gore_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> The Pro Football Hall of Fame will note be able to ignore Frank Gore's career stats | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Frank Gore may not be the flashiest running back in NFL history, but his consistency and production are both factors that cannot be ignored by the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee.

In an era where NFL running backs rarely have decade-long careers, Gore has excelled for most of 12 seasons. The former Miami Hurricane has nine 1,000-yard seasons in his career, and has rushed for a total of 13,065 yards (eighth all time) and 80 touchdowns, and caught 414 passes for 3,427 yards and 16 touchdowns.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Anquan Boldin, WR, Detroit Lions</h2>
[caption id="attachment_619130" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-619130" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Anquan-Boldin_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x758.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="560" /> Anquan Boldin has flown under the radar and put up Pro Football Hall of Fame numbers | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Surprised to see Anquan Boldin’s name on this list? You shouldn't be when you consider the body of work he's produced over the course of his 14-year NFL career. In fact, a close look at his resume makes it unmistakably clear that the three-time Pro Bowler deserves a bronze bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The former Florida State Seminole has caught 1,076 passes (which is the ninth most in NFL history) for 13,779 yards (14th most in NFL history) and 82 touchdowns. While he may not have the accolades of some, Boldin does have the stats, as well as a Super Bowl ring to his name.

<h2>11. Rob Gronkowski, TE, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663449" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663449" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rob-Gronkowski_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-1-1024x765.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="566" /> Rob Gronkowski could end up being the best tight end in NFL history | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Gronk has only been in the NFL for seven seasons, but we believe the 6-foot-6, 265-pound tight end has already done enough to lock up a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame when he decides to walk away from the game of football. Rob Gronkowski is a dominating blocker, but what truly sets him apart from his peers is his ability as a receiver.

To date, Gronkowski has caught 405 passes for 6,095 yards and 68 touchdowns. He is a four-time first-team All-Pro and was a key player in the Patriots' run to the Super Bowl XLIX title. In fact, we think so highly of Gronkowski that we are fairly confident in saying he will go down as the best tight end in NFL history.

<h2>12. Jason Witten, TE, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_552796" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-552796 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jason-Witten_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="525" /> Jason Witten is one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2014, quarterback Tony Romo suggested that Jason Witten may be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dallas-cowboys-players-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best player in Dallas Cowboys franchise history</a>. While that statement is wildly farfetched, Witten is a lock to join the Pro Football Hall of Fame when his NFL career concludes. He already joined the 1,000-catch club (1,089 to be exact). Witten has also posted 11,888 receiving yards and 63 touchdown receptions. The 34-year-old is an excellent blocker, and will go down as one of the best all-around tight ends in NFL history.

<h2>13. Antonio Gates, TE, San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679843" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679843" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Antonio-Gates_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Stephen Dunn/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Antonio Gates revolutionized the tight end position in the NFL | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, Antonio Gates has revolutionized the tight end position in the NFL. The eight-time Pro Bowler entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent who never played a down of college football. For those who don't know, he was a standout basketball player for Kent State (he earned All-America honors and had his college jersey retired after helping the Golden Flash reach the Elite Eight in the 2002 NCAA Tournament).

For as good of a basketball player as he was in college, Gates, who measures in at 6-foot-4 and 255 pounds, didn’t exactly fit the mold of an NBA power forward, so he decided to try his hand at football. The move paid off in a big way. He has caught 897 passes for 11,192 yards and 111 touchdowns, which are Hall of Fame numbers. More importantly, Gates has opened the door to the NFL for former basketball players such as Julius Thomas and Jimmy Graham.

<h2>14. Joe Thomas, OT, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661205" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661205" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Thomas_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x686.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="507" /> Joe Thomas has played at a Hall of Fame caliber level for his entire career | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s unfortunate that Joe Thomas has spent his entire career playing for the Browns. If he played for a competent organization that could put together a playoff-caliber team on a regular basis, more people would understand exactly how good the former Wisconsin Badger has been since entering the league in 2007.

In his 10 NFL seasons, Thomas has earned All-Pro honors eight times (with a ninth selection likely coming this year) and Pro Bowl honors 10 times, and has never missed a snap. At 31 years old, he is showing no signs of slowing down.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>15. Jason Peters, OT, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_544276" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-544276" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jason-Peters_Al-Bello_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="500" height="644" /> Tight end Jason Peters has gone from undrafted free agent to future Hall of Famer | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Jason Peters entered the league as an undrafted free agent after serving as an oversized tight end during his college career at the University of Arkansas. And while it took some time, he eventually found a home at left tackle.

Since landing his first full-time starting job in 2006, Peters has earned All-Pro honors six times and has been selected to nine Pro Bowls. He may be on the tail end of his career, but the 6-foot-4, 328-pounder continues to play at an extremely high level and shouldn’t have to wait very long after his retirement to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>16. J.J. Watt, DE, Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_643856" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-643856" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JJ-Watt_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images-1024x757.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="800" height="591" /> J.J. Watt has a chance to go down as the best defensive player in NFL history | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

J.J. Watt was the best overall player in the National Football League from 2012-2015. He may have missed most of the 2016 season, but we are confident that we haven't seen the last of Watt dominating opposing NFL offenses.

In his five NFL seasons, the former Wisconsin Badger has won three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards, earned Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors four times, and led the league in sacks twice. He already has accumulated 76.0 career sacks, and if he plays long enough, he could legitimately challenge Bruce Smith’s all-time NFL sacks record.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>17. Julius Peppers, DE/OLB, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_679846" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679846" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Julius-Peppers_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images-1-1024x861.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="637" /> Julius Peppers is one of the most gifted athletes to ever play in the NFL | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

At 6-foot-7 and 287 pounds with 4.65-second speed in the 40-yard dash, Julius Peppers is one of the most physically gifted athletes the NFL has ever seen. The former University of North Carolina two-sport (basketball and football) standout has been one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL since he entered the league in 2002. He has earned Pro Bowl honors nine times and All-Pro honors six times, he won the 2004 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award, and he has the ninth-most career sacks (143.5) in league history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>18. DeMarcus Ware, OLB, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743899" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743899" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DeMarcus-Ware_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1-1024x645.jpg" alt="DeMarcus Ware can still play at a high level, but can't seem to stay healthy | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="476" /> Outside linebacker and defensive end DeMarcus Ware has had a Hall of Fame career | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

DeMarcus Ware finally got a Super Bowl ring, which was the only thing missing from his impressive resume, with the Broncos in 2015. Since entering the league with the Dallas Cowboys in 2005, Ware has earned All-Pro honors seven times and Pro Bowl honors nine times, and he led the league in sacks twice. His 138.5 career sacks are good for the eighth-most of all time. If Ware hadn't announced his retirement in March 2017, he would've jumped into the top five all time.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>19. Darrelle Revis, CB, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_667472" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-667472" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Darrelle-Revis_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-2-1024x628.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="464" /> Darrelle Revis is arguably the best cornerback in NFL history | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes down to it, Darrelle Revis was arguably the best cover cornerback the NFL has ever seen when he was in his prime. For most of his career, he has taken his half of the field away from opposing offenses, while also completely shutting down some of the best wide receivers in the game. In total, Revis has seven Pro Bowl selections, five first-team All-Pro selections, one Super Bowl title, and 29 career interceptions to his name.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>20. Adam Vinatieri, K, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Adam-Vinatieri_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="These competitors will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming NFL Hall of Fame Players" width="757" height="540" /> Adam Vinatieri is the best clutch kicker in NFL history | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

We know it’s extremely rare for kickers and punters to get serious Hall of Fame consideration, but Adam Vinatieri is fully deserving of the honor. He may be the greatest kicker in the history of the National Football League and he will forever be remembered for making clutch postseason kicks. While he won’t be a first-ballot selecton, Vinatieri will eventually have a bronze bust in Canton, Ohio.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_578103" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578103" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x429.jpg" alt="Tom Brady looks for a target." width="757" height="507" /> Tom Brady looks to throw | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL quarterbacks hold one of the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-with-the-highest-selling-jerseys-in-2016.html/">revered and glorious job titles</a>. There is a full roster of position players on a football team; while all are important, none carry the responsibility and circumstance the quarterback does. NFL teams create an identity for their cities and fanbases to latch on to, and no player sets that tone <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-undrafted-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">like the QB</a>. So, naturally, when it comes to discussing the greatest NFL quarterbacks, a select few names always rise to the top.

After an incredible come-from-behind Super Bowl victory, football fans and aficionados were free to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-best-quarterback-nfl-history.html/">resurrect this eternal debate</a> as they contemplated where Tom Brady lands on the list. The argument over where the Patriots’ quarterback and Super Bowl 51 MVP <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-greatest-nfl-players-of-all-%C2%ADtime.html/">stands among the greatest QBs</a> of all time has been debated for years now.

It is a heavily coveted club; many starting NFL quarterbacks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-backup-nfl-quarterbacks.html/">are considered good</a>, but very few considered great, and an even smaller portion are considered legendary. So how does Brady match up with the John Elways and Joe Montanas of the modern football era? Here we rank the top 10 NFL quarterbacks of all time.
<h2>10. Fran Tarkenton</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh05pNJ_Eys"></iframe>
"Scramblin’ Fran” set the gold standard while inventing the term “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-7-rushing-quarterbacks-in-nfl-history.html/">mobile quarterback</a>” thanks to his knack for evading rushers in the pocket and scrambling to the outside to keep plays alive. Tarketon is historically identified with his two separate stints with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-sports-franchises-desperately-need-a-championship.html/">Minnesota Vikings</a>. Of course, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-teams-didnt-win-super-bowl.html/">losing three separate Super Bowls</a> (to Miami, Pittsburgh, and Oakland) define the 1970s Purple People Eaters and Bud Grant.

Those failures aside, Tarkenton remains one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time. He retired as the top quarterback in terms of yardage (<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TarkFr00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47,003</a>), completions (3,686), and touchdowns (342). On top of that, Tarkenton finished his career with 3,674 rushing yards. His antics as a scrambler prevented injury. They also extended the career of this 6-foot, 190 pound lightweight, who lacked the cannon arm of a prototypical QB.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Otto Graham</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCDZV4sIEEU"></iframe>
Otto Graham is arguably the greatest winner of all time in any sport. This college running back made the switch to quarterback at the professional level and ran the Wing T to perfection for Paul Brown’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/">eponymous Cleveland Browns</a>. He guided the franchise to 10 straight title games, four All-America Football Conference championships, and three NFL championships. Graham’s staggering feats and gamesmanship dominate the longevity of any dynasty.

Despite the accolades, Graham’s position at the apex of NFL lore is diminished by the relatively crude offenses and defensive schemes of the ’40s and ’50s. Although Graham led the AFC and NFL in passing in five separate seasons, his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GrahOt00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">23,584 passing yards</a> are only good enough for No. 81 on the all-time list.

<h2>8. Steve Young</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684737" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684737" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51635195-626x500.jpg" alt="San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young throws." width="757" height="605" /> Steve Young looks to throw against the Colts | Monica M. Davey/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Not many believed that Steve Young would emerge as one of the greats. The Buccaneers tossed aside the BYU product after his miserable tenure in Tampa Bay. Young headed to San Francisco to warm the bench in favor of eventual four-time Super Bowl-winner Joe Montana. Still, the dynamic lefty demonstrated his athletic ability. Young dazzled the coaching staff with his ability to improvise out of the pocket.

His capacity to deftly facilitate the intricacies of the West Coast offense helped him win the 1992 MVP award while Montana recovered from injury. These offensive fireworks led to a QB controversy pitting Young against Montana. Then, San Francisco traded Joe Montana to Kansas City, putting Young in command. Despite his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-5-quarterbacks-in-nfl-history.html/">staggering statistical output</a> featuring 68% completion rates and 100+ passer ratings, commentators blasted No.8 for his inability to beat the Dallas Cowboys and win Super Bowls.

Young battled back with an epic 1994 campaign, leading the 49ers to a 13-3 mark, behind 70% passing, 3,969 yards, and 35 touchdowns through the air. To cap off this magical season, he outlasted the rival Cowboys and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-super-bowl-blowouts-nfl-history.html/">destroyed the San Diego Chargers</a> 49-26 in Super Bowl XXIX by tossing a record 6 TD passes. We wonder what he could have accomplished had head injuries not forced him to retire.

<h2>7. Peyton Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675587" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675587" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Peyton-Manning-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning looks for a Broncos target in the backfield." width="757" height="504" /> The Sheriff is the most recent retiree on this list | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Kids these days know Peyton Manning more for the commercials he appears in. But before everything was chicken parm and Papa John’s, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-7-sets-of-siblings-in-sports-history.html/">Eli’s older brother</a> created the mold for the all-American NFL quarterback.

Ever the model of consistency, Manning facilitated the staggering statistical resumes of receivers on the Colts. Prior to a season-ending neck injury that also <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-trades-ever.html/">led to his exit</a> from Indianapolis, Manning aired out the football for over 3,500 yards and 25 touchdowns for 13 straight NFL seasons. He was the recipient of four AP NFL Player of the Year awards, as well as 14 Pro Bowl selections.

Mounting injuries plagued the end of Manning’s career, as he manned the helm of the Denver Broncos’ offense. He finally <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-retirements-2016.html/">hung up his cleats</a> following a victory over Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-athletes-retire-champions.html/">in Super Bowl 50</a>.

<h2>6. Johnny Unitas</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684739" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1379084.jpg" alt="A retired Johnny Unitas smiles from the sidelines." width="757" height="498" /> Johnny Unitas may have been the first great quarterback | David Leeds/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-who-should-have-retired-sooner.html/">Mr. Clutch</a> paved the way for Manning as a star quarterback for the Colts franchise. Old timers may hail Unitas as the first and foremost great signal-caller. He received the torch from Graham in the late ’50s <span class="s1">-- </span>calling his own plays, launching bombs, and orchestrating game-winning drives.

With that mix of smarts and strength, Unitas <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-steals-in-nfl-draft-history.html/">marched the Baltimore Colts</a> toward two NFL crowns and one Super Bowl V ring. From playing semi-pro ball for $6 a game to earning a spot to the NFL table, he revolutionized the NFL offense with 40,239 total passing yards and 290 touchdowns.

Perhaps most importantly, Unitas helped usher football onto TV and into the homes for American viewers. His Colts beat the New York Giants in sudden-death overtime in the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which receives credit as the rumble that increased the popularity of NFL television. The game has since been dubbed “The Greatest Game Ever Played.”

<h2>5. Brett Favre</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684741" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684741" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/107848739.jpg" alt="Brett Favre smiles as he walks toward the locker room." width="757" height="563" /> Brett Favre is, undeniably, one of the best NFL quarterbacks ever | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Before multiple retirements and comebacks, including stints with the Vikings and Jets, Brett Favre was the face of the Green Bay Packers franchise. The gunslinger was lauded for his joy for the game, Frozen Tundra heroics, and imposing arm strength. Despite the drama, Favre will remain <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-nfls-7-most-passionate-fan-bases.html/">much beloved in Wisconsin</a> and will walk into Canton as a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-there-be-any-first-ballot-hall-of-famers-in-2017.html/">first-ballot Hall of Famer</a>.

The Iron Man, who started 297 consecutive regular season games, finished first in passing completions (6,300), yards (71,838), and touchdowns (508). He also rests one Super Bowl chip and three AP NFL MVP awards on his trophy mantle, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-oldest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">peaking as a player</a> in '96 and '97 with back-to-back Super Bowl appearances

<h2>4. Dan Marino</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684395" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684395" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dan-Marino-Rhona-Wise-AFP-Getty-Images-592x500.jpg" alt="Dan Marino grips the football and focuses on his receivers." width="757" height="639" /> Dan Marino can't shoulder all the blame for his playoff failures | Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite the fact that the Isotoner pitchman performed as a virtual stiff behind center, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/5-famous-nfl-players-who-lost-their-fortunes.html/">Dan Marino</a> and his quick release <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/14-quarterbacks-who-looked-elite-during-their-first-starting-seasons.html/">rarely took sacks</a>. In fact, Marino was sacked only six times during 1988, when he dropped back to pass for 606 attempts. In 1984, Marino threw for 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns. From there a 27-year-old Marino matched up against Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. After Miami's Super Bowl XIX loss to the 49ers dynasty, leading football commentators generally agreed that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-miami-dolphins-ever.html/">young Marino</a> would be back.

Marino never returned to the Big Game, though, as his career took hits from Miami’s lack of a running game and Swiss cheese-like defense. We may only speculate as to what might have been with Marino starring alongside Hall-of-Fame backs, receivers, and defenders in South Florida. Nevertheless, the 2005 Hall of Famer spent his 17-year career with the Miami Dolphins and owned every significant passing record upon retirement.

<h2>3. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684744" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-684744" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/465887415.jpg" alt="John Elway signs his jersey while visiting the New York Stock Exchange." width="756" height="504" /> John Elway transitioned into a great GM after his career as a QB ended | Andrew Burton/Getty Images[/caption]

Before he was even drafted, the Denver Broncos’ figurehead had the makeup to be one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks. As the son of a college football coach with both superior athleticism and football smarts, Elway went first overall in the 1983 NFL Draft <span class="s1">-- </span>to the Baltimore Colts. Of course, that was before he refused to report and was subsequently traded to Denver, where his career flourished.

Above all, Elway is largely identified with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-plays-in-super-bowl-history.html/">fourth-quarter comeback</a> and holds the record with 47 drives to tie or win football games within the final stanza. Elway rode off into the sunset as the owner of two Super Bowl rings to go alongside his 51,475 total yards passing. He currently <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-5-best-general-managers-in-the-nfl.html/">serves as the General Manager</a> of his beloved Broncos.

<h2>2. Joe Montana</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684346" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684346" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Joe-Montana-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joe Montana adjusts his sunglasses while walking along the sideline." width="757" height="505" /> Joe Montana still sits at the top of the QB mountain | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

Even the most casual football fan knows about the legend of Joe Cool. Montana was the ultimate gamer who, arguably, dispatched Marino and Elway to second-class status. Montana arrived at a middling San Francisco franchise as a scrawny, 1979 third-round pick; he left at the forefront of the greatest offensive dynasty in the history of football.

Montana lacked the big arm, yet managed to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-10-offensive-performances-in-super-bowl-history.html/">orchestrate the Niners’ offense to perfection</a>, delivering the ball with timing and touch to blitz defenses for 40,551 career passing yards. Montana went 83 for 122 to pass for 1,142 yards and 11 touchdowns against zero interceptions in four Super Bowls, translating into an astronomical 127.8 quarterback rating in the Big Game.

He retired with four Super Bowls win, three Super Bowl MVP awards, eight Pro Bowl nods, and two league MVP awards.

<h2>1. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675508" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675508" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady holds up his hands and signals to his offense." width="757" height="543" /> Tom Brady cemented his legacy as the GOAT by winning Super Bowl 51 | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Brady has certainly come a long way from being a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-drafted-ahead-tom-brady.html/">sixth-round draft pick</a> and backing up Drew Bledsoe. Since first stepping into the limelight after Bledsoe was injured, No. 12 has transformed the rag-tag New England Patriots offensive roster into one of the most intimidating in the NFL. Despite back-to-back Super Bowl losses to the New York Giants, Brady has piloted to the Patriots’ ship to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/">multiple Big Game victories</a>, including a come-from-behind Super Bowl 51 victory over the Atlanta Falcons.

His NFL quarterback career has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-new-england-patriots-4-biggest-scandals.html/">not been without blemish</a>, however. The Patriots have been marred in their fair share of drama since the turn of the millennium, from the Tuck Rule and Deflategate to other rumors that the team cheats their way to the top. Even with baggage, Brady has already made his mark on history as one of the best to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">play the NFL quarterback position</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[In honor of Derek Carr signing a massive contract extension with the Oakland Raiders, here is a look at the 20 largest contracts in NFL history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last quarter-century, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Football League</a> has turned into a multibillion-dollar entity. As a result, the size of player contracts <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-worst-free-agency-contracts-of-the-2016-offseason.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increases significantly</a> every year. With news that <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20491086/matthew-stafford-detroit-lions-agree-historic-5-year-deal">Matthew Stafford just signed a record-breaking contract</a> with the Detroit Lions, we take a look at the 20 other biggest contracts in NFL history, based on total contract value.
<h2>20. Justin Houston - $101 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595430" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595430" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Justin-Houston_Kyle-Rivas_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kansas City Chiefs outside linebacker Justin Houston celebrates a sack." width="757" height="505" /> Justin Houston is dominant when healthy. | Kyle Rivas/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 6</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2015</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $16,833,333</li>
</ul>
This contract helped set the current market rate for elite NFL edge defenders. Justin Houston landed this deal, which included $52.5 million guaranteed, following the 2014 season when he posted a league-high 22 sacks. When healthy, Houston is one of the most dominant pass rushers in the league.

<h2>19. Ben Roethlisberger - $102 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658661" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658661" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ben-Roethlisberger_Jared-Wickerham_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers watches from the sideline." width="757" height="505" /> Big Ben has earned his money. | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 8</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2008</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $12.75 million</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ben-roethlisberger-stack-time-nfl-greats.html/">Ben Roethlisberger</a> signed this deal, which included $36 million in guaranteed money, during the 2008 offseason. At the time it was one of the largest contracts in league history. He's since restructured this pact (to give the Steelers extra salary cap flexibility) and signed another hefty extension in 2015.

<h2>18. Fletcher Cox - $102.6 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682818" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682818" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Fletcher-Cox_Mitchell-Leff_Getty-Images-1-1024x726.jpg" alt="Fletcher Cox of the Philadelphia Eagles reacts to a sack." width="757" height="537" /> Fletcher Cox is a very wealthy man. | Mitchell Leff/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 6</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2016</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $17.1 million</li>
</ul>
Fletcher Cox may be one of the lesser-known players on this list, but he unquestionably deserves  this massive deal. The 26-year-old, who has two All-<span class="s1">P</span>ro selections on his resume, received $36.3 million guaranteed at signing and total guarantees of $63 million.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>17. Drew Bledsoe - $103 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_721359" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721359" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Drew-Bledsoe_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-2-1024x710.jpg" alt="Drew Bledsoe meets with the press during Super Bowl media day. " width="757" height="525" /> Drew Bledsoe lost his job to Tom Brady. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 10</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2001</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $10.3 million</li>
</ul>
At the time Drew Bledsoe put ink to paper on this deal, which included roughly $30 million in guaranteed money, he signed the single largest contract in NFL history. Of course, as history would have it, the emergence of a young quarterback named Tom Brady resulted in Bledsoe <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-best-quarterbacks-to-ever-play-for-the-new-england-patriots.html/">only playing one year</a> of this deal for the Patriots.

<h2>16. Matt Ryan - $103.75 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_754798" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-754798" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Matt-Ryan-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons celebrates after defeating the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game." width="757" height="505" /> Matt Ryan is closing in on a massive contract extension. | Kevin C.

<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 5</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2013</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $20.75 million</li>
</ul>
Matt Ryan signed this deal, which came with $59 million guaranteed, before he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-biggest-nfl-rookie-contracts-in-history.html/">reached his full potential</a> as an NFL quarterback. Now, with this contract set to expire following the 2018 season, the Falcons have already started working on another extension for the former Boston College star. With a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-atlanta-falcons-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfc.html/">Super Bowl appearance</a> and NFL MVP now on his resume, Ryan's next deal will likely be even bigger.

<h2>15. Tony Romo - $108 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_726730" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-726730" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tony-Romo-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-1024x717.jpg" alt="Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys looks on from the sideline." width="757" height="530" /> Tony Romo cashed in during his NFL career. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 6</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><u>Year signed</u></span>: 2013</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $18 million</li>
</ul>
This contract made <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-games-of-tony-romos-nfl-career.html/?a=viewall">Tony Romo</a> the highest-paid player in Cowboys history. The deal came with $55 million in total guarantees, but Romo missed out on the contract's final three years after he chose to retire this offseason and transition to a career in broadcasting.

<h2>14. Aaron Rodgers - $110 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_635542" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635542" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Aaron-Rodgers_Mike-McGinnis_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Quarterback Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers looks on during an NFL game." width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers is actually underpaid. | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Years</u>: 5</li>
 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2013</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $22 million</li>
</ul>
Believe it or not, this contract actually qualifies <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-players-who-are-locks-for-the-hall-of-fame.html/?a=viewall">Aaron Rodgers</a> as underpaid. And <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2017/06/06/rodgers-contract-extension-take-care-itself/375831001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he knows it</a>. Nonetheless, this deal, which came with $54 million in total guarantees, is still one of the largest in NFL history. When Rodgers inevitably lands his next contract, it will likely set a new record for average annual value.

</ul>
After he earned first-team All-Pro honors for the Detroit Lions in each his first four NFL seasons, Ndamukong Suh became one of the best and most anticipated free agents to hit the open market in the last decade.

With that being the case, it should come as no surprise that he signed a contract <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-miami-dolphins-approach-to-building-a-team-is-wrong.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with the Miami Dolphins</a> during the 2015 offseason that made him the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-is-ndamukong-suh-really-more-valuable-than-j-j-watt.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid defensive player in NFL history</a>. Side note: Had the Lions managed their cap more effectively, they likely would not have lost Suh to the Dolphins.

</ul>
The Denver Broncos really had no choice but to sign <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-players-to-perform-on-dancing-with-the-stars.html/?a=viewall">Von Miller</a> to a record-breaking contract after he led them to a victory in Super Bowl 50. The five-time All-Pro inked his deal, which includes $70 million in guaranteed money, shortly before training camp opened last offseason. This deal is now the benchmark for defensive contracts going forward. Look for Khalil Mack of the Oakland Raiders to set his sights on eclipsing Miller's numbers.

<h2>10. (tie) Andy Dalton <span class="s1">– $115 million</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_568013" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568013" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andy-Dalton_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andy Dalton pumps his fist after a touchdown pass." width="757" height="505" /> Andy Dalton is one of the highest-paid players in the NFL. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2014</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $19,166,667</li>
</ul>
Don’t let the total value of Andy Dalton’s six-year contract extension fool you; this is a team-friendly deal. The only guaranteed money in Dalton’s contract came in the first year (2014). From then on, the Bengals did an excellent job of protecting themselves and their salary cap.

Basically, Dalton has to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underrated-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earn his payday</a> every year, and if he doesn’t, Cincinnati can cut him without incurring a significant amount of dead money on their cap. While Dalton played at an MVP level prior to getting hurt in 2015, he will have to eventually win a playoff game (he has an 0-4 career postseason record) if he wants to ensure that his job with the Bengals is safe.

<h2>10. (tie) Donovan McNabb <span class="s1">– </span>$115 million</h2>

 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2002</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $9,583,333</li>
</ul>
When <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-7-rushing-quarterbacks-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Donovan McNabb</a> signed this contract back in 2002, it was the <a href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/092802/spo_20020928037.shtml#.V3SnW1eBfww" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">richest contract in NFL history</a> at the time. However, by today’s standards, this contract -- despite carrying a nine-figure total value -- isn’t really all that large.

When spread out over the length of the deal (12 years), it carries an average annual value of just over $9.5 million, which isn’t much when you consider that today’s top starting quarterbacks earn around $20 million per year.

<h2>9. Carson Palmer <span class="s1">–</span> $119.75 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661848" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661848" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Carson-Palmer_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1-1024x630.jpg" alt="Carson Palmer signals a play." width="757" height="466" /> Carson Palmer was once the face of the Cincinnati Bengals franchise. | Kevin C.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $13,305,555</li>
</ul>
It’s hard to believe that it's been over a decade since Carson Palmer played at an MVP-caliber level for the Cincinnati Bengals. He signed this contract toward the end of his second season (his third season in the NFL) as the Bengals’ starting quarterback, and it was meant to keep Palmer in a Cincinnati uniform for the remainder of his career.

However, 10 days after he signed this contract extension, Palmer suffered a gruesome knee injury in a 2006 playoff game. He's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-who-need-to-retire-now.html/">never regained his elite form</a> with the Bengals.

Palmer battled inconsistencies with the Bengals and the Oakland Raiders for the next seven seasons before landing on his feet with the Arizona Cardinals in 2013. Ironically, two days after he signed a three-year, $50 million extension with Arizona, Palmer <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/11/10/the-carson-palmer-contract-jinx-strikes-again-cardinals-qb-believed-to-have-torn-acl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered another serious injury</a> to the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-should-the-cardinals-do-with-carson-palmer.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same knee</a> he hurt in Cincinnati.

<h2>8. Larry Fitzgerald <span class="s1">– </span>$120 million</h2>

 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2011</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $15 million</li>
</ul>
When Larry Fitzgerald signed this contract back in 2011, it was clear that the Arizona Cardinals wanted the 6-foot-3, 225-pound wide receiver to retire as a member of their organization. Truth be told, he earned this contract.

Regardless of who the team had playing quarterback, Fitzgerald put up All-Pro caliber numbers. In an era of diva wide receivers, he went about his business like a true professional.

<h2>7. Joe Flacco <span class="s1">– </span>$120.6 million</h2>

 	<li><u>Year signed</u>: 2013</li>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $20.1 million</li>
</ul>
This contract may be one of the worst NFL contracts (from a team-friendly perspective) in recent history, but it’s hard to blame the Baltimore Ravens for making it happen. The Ravens originally offered a much more reasonable contract to Joe Flacco during the summer 2012, after the former Delaware quarterback <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7772584/joe-flacco-baltimore-ravens-says-think-best-qb-nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">infamously claimed</a> that he was “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-top-5-baltimore-ravens-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elite</a>” and that he is “the best quarterback in the NFL.”

To his credit, Flacco bet on himself, and while his regular-season performance was nothing special, he was outstanding during Baltimore’s postseason run to the Super Bowl XLVII title. As a result, the Ravens were more or less forced to sign him to this deal, which made Flacco the highest-paid player in the league at that time.

<h2>6. Derek Carr - $125 million</h2>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year:</span> $25 million</li>
</ul>
We saw this one coming for a while. Derek Carr helped revive the Oakland Raiders, so it was only a matter of time until the former second-round pick out of Fresno State officially got paid. The former second-round pick out of Fresno State got $40 million guaranteed at signing and $70 million in total guarantees. His average per year value of $25 mullion set a new league record.

<h2>5. Colin Kaepernick <span class="s1">– </span>$126 million</h2>

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $21 million</li>
</ul>
When Colin Kaepernick signed this contract, he was one of the fastest rising players in the league. The San Francisco 49ers were legitimate Super Bowl contenders. In the deal, the 6-foot-4, 225-pound dual-threat quarterback received a then-league record $61 million in guarantees and a $12.33 million signing bonus. Unfortunately for the 49ers, they've fallen on hard times, which can largely be attributed to Kaepernick’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-teams-deperate-enough-to-sign-colin-kaepernick.html/">inconsistent play</a> and stalling development.

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $18.1 million</li>
</ul>
There may not be a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-bad-attitudes.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more frustrating player</a> in the NFL than Jay Cutler. Based on physical ability alone, you could legitimately argue that the former Vanderbilt signal caller was one of the top two or three quarterbacks in the game. But as we’ve learned on many occasions, physical ability alone doesn’t equate to success in the NFL. With that being said, the Bears bet big on Cutler’s immense potential with this deal.

<h2>3. Michael Vick <span class="s1">– </span>$130 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661903" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661903" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Michael-Vick_Joe-Murphy_Getty-Images-1-1024x791.jpg" alt="Michael Vick looks for a target in the backfield." width="757" height="585" /> Michael Vick signed two $100 million NFL contracts during his career. | Joe Murphy/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average value per year</span>: $13 million</li>
</ul>
Michael Vick's unique skill set took the NFL by storm from the moment he entered the league with the Atlanta Falcons in 2001. He had arguably the strongest arm in the league and was faster than most wide receivers, running backs, and defensive backs. Needless to say, he caused many sleepless nights for opposing defensive coordinators.

The Atlanta Falcons rewarded him with this record-breaking contract toward the end of the 2004 season, but due to his role <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-hated-players-nfl.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an illegal dog-fighting ring</a>, Vick only played two more seasons in Atlanta. Interestingly, after serving his jail sentence, Vick got a second chance with the Philadelphia Eagles, which he ultimately parlayed into another $100 million contract.

Calvin Johnson, who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/marshawn-lynch-and-calvin-johnson-may-have-just-changed-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retired from the NFL</a>, was the most physically imposing wide receiver the league has ever seen. His combination of size (6-foot-5, 239 pounds) and speed (he ran a 4.3-second 40-yard dash) made him a flat-out matchup nightmare for opposing secondaries.

The Lions <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/megabucks-calvin-johnson-becomes-nfl-highest-paid-receiver-163448919.html;_ylt=AoSAKq.9oz8z2fLDvFdG4TpDubYF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed Johnson to this massive contract</a> during the 2014 offseason, which at the time was the largest contract in NFL history. However, with his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decision to walk away</a> from the game, “Megatron” will miss out on earning the bulk of the money in this deal.

</ul>
The Indianapolis Colts <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/16619414/andrew-luck-signs-extension-indianapolis-colts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made history</a> by signing Luck to this six-year, $140 million contract extension. The total value of the contract is a new league record, as are the average value per year and guaranteed money ($87 million) in the deal.

Since entering the league back in 2012, Luck has been highly-regarded -- many people called him the best quarterback prospect since John Elway in 1983 -- and up to this point he hasn't disappointed. He has emerged as a perennial All-Pro and MVP candidate, despite playing behind below-average offensive lines during his time in Indianapolis.

If he can lead the Colts to a Super Bowl title, this contract will be worth every penny.

Don’t <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-biggest-comeback-wins-in-nfl-history.html/">call it a comeback</a>. Unless, of course, your name is Herschel Walker. Back in 2015, despite being 53 years old at the time and not having played in the NFL since 1997, the two-time Pro Bowler was convinced he could <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25218576/herschel-walker-53-says-he-could-still-play-in-the-nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still compete in today’s game</a>. While discussing the matter on the <em>Boomer &amp; Carton</em> radio show, the former running back was nothing but confident.

“There is not a doubt in my mind," Walker said. Of course, were he ever to truly give this a shot, he’d still need some pretty good wheels. However, according to Walker, he can still fly. “The last time I ran a 40, I ran a 4.3," Walker said. “That was like a year ago. That was when I had not been doing any track work. All I had been doing was [MMA]."

The truth is, Walker lost us the moment he started talking about mixed martial arts. But that didn’t make what he said any less intriguing. We certainly admire his enthusiasm and confidence. He’d need both of those things if he ever really wanted to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-retirements-2016.html/">come out of retirement</a> and battle in the NFL.

We’d love to believe that this <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-greatest-players-to-retire-early-from-the-nfl.html/">is an actual possibility</a>. However, the skeptic in us reminds us that it isn’t. Still, that doesn’t mean we won't play the game anyway. If Walker is convinced he could make a comeback, then why can’t other players? With that in mind, here are 11 retired NFL players who we believe could still play in today’s NFL.

<h2>1. Ronde Barber</h2>

Meric/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 42

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1997–2012

In his 16 seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ronde Barber made five Pro Bowls, was a First-Team All-Pro three times, and won the Super Bowl in 2002. He retired after the 2012 season <span class="s2">-- </span>fat 37 years old <span class="s2">-- </span>following a career that saw him amass <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BarbRo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,028 tackles and 47 interceptions</a>. While he wouldn’t be a spring chicken if he ever tried to return to the gridiron, the 41-year-old was a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/strongest-nfl-defenses-in-history.html/">smart, durable, and versatile player</a>; the latter trait being the most important piece of the puzzle.

Barber spent his entire career as a cornerback, but switched it up to free safety for his final season in the league. In that particular ball-hawk position, we think Barber might be able to go a few quarters with the big boys. Of course, he would have to consider playing the backup role. And we know how <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2013/05/09/ronde-barber-retirement-buccaneers-interest/2146487/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn’t like that</a>.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 46

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1998–2009

We’re not usually fans of former quarterbacks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-oldest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">coming out of retirement</a>. This position is hard enough while you’re in your prime, let alone when you don’t have all your faculties. Still, if anyone could do it, it’d be Kurt Warner. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-undrafted-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">12-year veteran</a> <span class="s2">-- </span>who made four Pro Bowls, won two MVP awards, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/15-teams-missed-playoffs-went-super-bowl.html/">led the Greatest Show on Turf</a> to the Super Bowl in 1999 <span class="s2">-- </span>is certainly smart and resourceful enough to play ball.

But we think Warner's greatest attribute is that, throughout most of his career, he played the role of the “<a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000371058/article/kurt-warners-unique-career-deserves-hof-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underdog</a>." Whether you’re a grocery store stock-boy or a world champion, that feeling never goes away. Plus, it’s not like he hasn’t <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12137830/kurt-warner-says-considered-coming-retirement-arizona-cardinals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considered it</a> before.

Retired life treats <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-linebackers-of-all-time.html/">linebacker Ray Lewis</a> pretty well. Following a 17-year career resulting in 13 Pro Bowls, seven First-Team All-Pro selections, two Defensive Player of the Year awards, and two Super Bowl victories, the former <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-top-5-baltimore-ravens-of-all-time.html/">Baltimore Raven icon</a> is currently making his mark as an ESPN analyst.

After <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-super-bowl-upsets-of-all-time.html/">closing out his storybook career</a> on top of the world, Lewis has nothing left to prove from strapping on his helmet and giving it one last go. However, if you see him on TV, then you know: the guy is still a physical monster. His mind is sharp, he looks the part, and we strongly believe that, even at 41 years old, Lewis could still get after it. We’re sure he’s got the war paint lying around somewhere.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 55

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1985–2004

Jerry Rice is considered by many to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-wide-receivers-of-all-time.html/">greatest wide receiver in NFL history</a>. The Hall of Famer is the career leader in receptions (1,549), receiving yards (22,895), and receiving touchdowns (197). He’s also 54 years old and, therefore, a major dark horse on the list.

Rice is far from the guy who went to 13 Pro Bowls, was a 10-time First-Team All-Pro, and won three Super Bowls. He’s not going to haul in an absurd amount of passes, go for crazy yards, or catch tons of touchdowns. His body probably won’t allow for it anymore. But his high football IQ, ability to run crisp routes, and wealth of knowledge would be enough to help Rice make some plays.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 45

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1993–2007

The only thing that might prevent <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-wealthiest-nfl-players-of-all-time.html/">Michael Strahan</a> from giving it another go in the NFL is the fact that he may very well be the busiest guy on the planet. Whether he’s<i> </i>working with <em>Fox NFL Sunday </em>or <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/worst-celebrity-scandals-2016.html/">doing his thing</a> on <em>Good Morning America</em>, Strahan lacks the time to get into official football shape.

However, it’s not like the 43-year-old is slouching. The guy looks like a freight train. We thoroughly believe the Hall of Famer could still strike fear in the hearts of quarterbacks throughout the entire NFL. Strahan might not record <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StraMi02.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">22.5 sacks</a> (again), but he could probably still do damage on the gridiron.

Few players seemed to enjoy playing football as much as Brett Favre. With his gunslinger mentality and rifle for an arm, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">Hall of Fame quarterback</a> spent 20 years carving up defenses to the tune of 71,838 career passing yards (No. 2 all time) and 508 touchdown passes (No. 2 all time). In the process, he also went to 11 Pro Bowls, won three MVPs, earned three First-Team All-Pro honors, and hoisted the Lombardi Trophy as a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-green-bay-packers-of-all-time.html/">member of the Green Bay Packers</a>.

Favre might've had a difficult time <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-who-should-have-retired-sooner.html/">walking away from the game</a> (understatement of the century), but if he <em>really</em> put his mind to it, something tells us he could still do some damage on the gridiron. For the record, just so we're clear, this is not something <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/athletes-couldnt-stay-retired.html/">we actually want</a> to see happen.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 40

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1998–2010, 2012

There's a reason Randy Moss was dubbed "The Freak" -- because he was. Throughout the course of career, the stud wideout was a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-wide-receivers-tom-brady.html/">bona fide touchdown machine</a> (leading the league in touchdown receptions five times) and a big play waiting to happen. Moss made six Pro Bowls, was a four-time First-Team All Pro, and walked away from the sport with 15,292 career receiving yards (No. 2 all time) and 156 touchdown receptions (No. 2 all time).

If Moss ever decided to make a comeback, there's a good chance he wouldn't be the same game-changing threat we all remember. However, the 6-foot-4 wideout remains confident that, given the right situation, he could <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/10/11/randy-moss-has-had-a-hard-time-letting-football-go/">still get the job done</a>. That's good enough for us.

Like him or not, Chad Johnson <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-there-be-any-first-ballot-hall-of-famers-in-2017.html/">was a beast</a>. In 11 seasons, Ochocinco had 11,059 receiving yards, 766 receptions, and 67 touchdown catches. He was a two-time First-Team All-Pro, a six-time Pro Bowler, and a dynamic playmaker. Although he's been out of the league since 2011, Johnson's the sort of guy that, if he ever considered making a comeback (for the record, he hasn't), we'd be foolish not to take him seriously. After all, the guy did race a horse. So, as far as we're concerned, anything is possible.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 43

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 1996–2010

Unless you're one of those vindictive Hall of Fame voters (yes, we went there), then you already know <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-steals-in-nfl-draft-history.html/">Terrell Owens</a> was one of the most dominant wide receivers in the history of the game. In 15 NFL seasons, T.O. went to six Pro Bowls, earned five First-Team All-Pro honors, and led the league in touchdown receptions in three separate seasons.

Sure, the guy had a tendency to tear locker rooms apart and was often undone by his childish behavior, but it's impossible to overlook his 1,078 receptions (No. 8 all time), 15,934 receiving yards (No. 2 all time), 153 touchdown receptions (No. 3 all time); unless, of course, you're a Hall of Fame voter who's unable leave your emotions at the door. Sorry, we couldn't help ourselves.

Owens might be 43 years old, but the guy continues to be a physical freak; one who knows better than anyone how to get himself -- and his body -- game ready. T.O. was ready to <a href="http://phi.247sports.com/Bolt/Terrell-Owens-tells-the-Eagles-hes-available-to-play-WR--48653403">provide his services</a> to the City of Brotherly Love.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Age</span>: 32

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Playing career</span>: 2007–15

This pick feels like cheating, but we don't care. Calvin Johnson walked away from the sport in 2015 to go <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-players-perform-dancing-stars.html/">dance with some stars</a>, so as far as we're concerned, he's completely fair game. During his nine-year career, Megatron had 11,619 receiving yards, 83 touchdown catches, and went to six Pro Bowls.

At 6-foot-5, 239 pounds, Calvin was one of those players you couldn't stop, so you just tried your best to contain him. Plus, aside from being recently removed from the game, the three-time First-Team All-Pro is just 31 years old. If Calvin wishes to return to the NFL, there's only one way to respond: Please and thank you.

This is not a joke. Have you seen Howie Long lately? Seriously, have you? The Hall of Famer is 57 years old, yet still looks like the same eight-time Pro Bowler who wreaked havoc for the Raiders during the '80s and '90s. If you don't think he could step on the field and mix it up in today's game, that's on you. But you won't be laughing when Long puts you on your back and steals your lunch money.

The NFL Draft is an inexact science. There is no better evidence of this than the fact that Tom Brady, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arguably the best quarterback to ever play in the NFL</a>, slid all the way into the sixth round of the 2000 draft.

The reasoning behind Brady’s shockingly low draft position stems from a combination of limited playing time at the University of Michigan, below-average athleticism, and an <a title="Tom Brady NFL Combine Performance" href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/0ap3000000470265/2000-NFL-Scouting-Combine-Tom-Brady" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">atrocious performance</a> at the NFL Scouting Combine. With that being said, if teams were allowed a do-over of the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady would have been the top prospect available by a margin wider than the Grand Canyon.

The reality of the situation is that the guys who get paid millions of dollars to assemble NFL teams thought so little of Brady that 198 players were selected ahead of him. Six of those 198 players were quarterbacks.

As you may have already suspected, none of the quarterbacks selected ahead of Brady in the 2000 NFL Draft had careers that were even close to being comparable to that of the five-time Super Bowl champion. In fact, you could add up the career professional accomplishments of all six and they would still not be comparable to Brady's tenure in the National Football League.

So who are the six quarterbacks who were drafted ahead of Brady in the 2000 NFL Draft? A couple of the names will likely ring a bell for most people, while others are complete head-scratchers. Without further ado, here is a look at the six quarterbacks who will forever live in infamy after being drafted before Tom Brady in the 2000 NFL Draft.

Chad Pennington had a solid NFL career, spending eight seasons with the New York Jets and three seasons with the Miami Dolphins before announcing his retirement in February 2012. He was the only quarterback who was selected in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft and he won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award twice during his professional career. Since retiring, Pennington has worked as an NFL Analyst for Fox and is now a <a title="Chad Pennington Is Now Coaching Football In Lexington, KY" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/chad-pennington-is-now-a-middle-school-coach-in-kentucky-183816907.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">middle school and youth football coach</a> in Lexington, Ky.

Giovanni Carmazzi is considered one of the <a title="Top 10 Quarterback Busts" href="http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/top_ten_QB_busts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest quarterback draft busts</a> in NFL history. Granted, he was only a third-round draft choice, but he never played a down in the league, only lasted two seasons with the organization, and was beaten out by seventh-round draft pick Tim Rattay. To make matters worse, when the 49ers selected Carmazzi, they passed on a Bay Area native and diehard Niners fan named Tom Brady.

<h2>3. Chris Redman, Louisville</h2>

 	<li>78.6 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Chris Redman had an eight-year NFL career, serving as the primary backup quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens and Atlanta Falcons for four years apiece. In his limited game action, Redman was solid, not spectacular, and could be counted on to keep his teams in games if an injury to a starter forced him into action. The highlight of Redman’s career may ultimately be the Super Bowl XXXV ring he won as the backup quarterback for the Ravens in his rookie season.

He only attempted 16 passes during his time in the NFL before retiring in 2004 and moving into the coaching profession.

He spent the first year of his NFL career bouncing around practice squads before landing with the St. Louis Rams, the team he would go on to play nine seasons for. Bulger was selected to two Pro Bowls, <a title="Top 5 Individual Performances in Pro Bowl History" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-best-individual-performances-in-pro-bowl-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning the Pro Bowl MVP in 2004</a>.

Spergon Wynn played one season with the Cleveland Browns and two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings before finishing his professional football career north of the U.S. border in the Canadian Football League. He struggled mightily in his limited playing time in the NFL but will always be remembered for being selected before Tom Brady in the 2000 NFL Draft.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_580675" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580675" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Jerry-Rice-DOUG-COLLIER-AFP-Getty-Images-640x469.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="555" /> Jerry Rice runs with the ball. | Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-wide-receiver-duos-in-the-nfl-today.html/?a=viewall">best wide receivers</a> are some of the most graceful athletes in the entire sports universe. Whether they're impressive physical specimens or simply phenomenal route runners, wideouts are visible, engaging, and capable of developing a unique chemistry with their quarterbacks, emerging as go-to-guys in the clutch. Old timers and self-proclaimed purists often write off wide receivers as prima donnas.

By definition, split ends and flankers must wave to signal for attention while running patterns, and this job description has attracted an eclectic bunch of personalities who demand the spotlight both on and off the field. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL</a> wide receivers from Chad Ochocinco to Michael Irvin have been associated with showboating and run-ins with the law.

For better or worse, "antics" seem to come part and parcel with many gifted wideouts. Ranking the thousands of wide receivers who pass through the NFL is daunting. Comparing players across eras is nearly impossible, and this dynamic list will always be up for debate.

We’ve got to give an honorable mention to Cris Carter, owner of arguably the greatest hands in the business, and now that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/calvin-johnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calvin “Megatron” Johnson</a> has hung up his cleats he’ll likely be a lock for this list as well -- we're still figuring out exactly where he sits.

<h2>10.  James Lofton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681941" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681941" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/82900699.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="530" /> James Lofton warms up. | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Rivaling Randy Moss as the most athletically gifted wide receiver of all time, James Lofton demonstrated pure speed. Fans recognized him for his long strides and sub-4.3 jets that torched defenses for 16 seasons, most notably in Green Bay and Buffalo. Lofton starred as a track star at Stanford, where he prepared for his NFL career beneath the tutelage of offensive guru Bill Walsh.

Lofton’s numbers highlight the fact that this man was about the big play. During the 1983 and 1984 seasons, Lofton averaged 22 yards per catch for the Packers. In fact, Lofton averaged more than 15 yards per catch in 14 out of his 16 NFL seasons, even though he is historically dismissed from the greatest wide receiver of all time discussion, despite retiring as the league's all-time leader in receiving yards with 14,004 (now <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No. 10 on the list</a>).

Rarely willing to go underneath, Lofton never caught more than 75 passes a season. Sadly, the failures of his Green Bay team overshadowed his career. In fact, most know Lofton for losing three consecutive Super Bowls.

<h2>9.  Marvin Harrison</h2>
[caption id="attachment_506089" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-506089" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Marvin-Harrison.jpg" alt="Stephen Dunn/Getty ImagesGREEN BAY, WI - OCTOBER 19: the Green Bay Packers the Indianapolis Colts on October 19, 2008 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay Wisconsin. The Packers won 34-14. (Photo by Stephen Dunn/Getty Images)" width="757" height="504" /> On the sidelines against the Green Bay Packers on October 19, 200| Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

Like his once-quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/peyton-manning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peyton Manning</a>, Marvin Harrison's career was so good for so long that the numbers are almost boring. Harrison logged 1,102 catches during his 13-year career with the Colts, a number that's good for second on the all-time list. Putting together his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarrMa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signature campaign in 2002</a>, Harrison snagged 143 catches, shattering the previous record by more than 20 receptions (and netting him over 1,700 yards in the process).

During his prime, Harrison’s slight build and quickness made him an impossible cover, as cornerbacks and safeties struggled to identify the routes he was running -- they all looked identical during the first, crucial, five to 10 yards. This sort of attention to detail dovetailed perfectly with his quarterback (Manning, obviously), and the two represent one of the more prolific pass-and-catch combinations of all time.

Unfortunately, Harrison’s <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2010/1/14/1645722/the-story-of-marvin-harrison-guns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged involvement in a 2008 North Philadelphia murder</a> didn't do his reputation any favors, either.

<h2>8. Steve Largent</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681949" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681949" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/98012522.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="586" /> Steve Largent speaks to an audience. | Ethan Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Often dismissed as a garden-variety possession guy, owing to his choirboy looks and lack of national exposure, Steve Largent's skill set has more in common with former Giant Steve Smith than Wes Welker or the lanky Ed McCaffrey. Largent was drafted as an afterthought (<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LargSt00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 117th pick in 1976</a>) and went on to lead the NFL in career receptions, yards, and touchdown catches at the time of his retirement.

What he lacked in straight-line speed, he made up for with his quickness and willingness to work the middle, and he used his tenacity to break tackles after the catch for extra yards, part of the reason he was able to finish his career averaging 16 yards per catch. His best individual season, in 1979, saw Largent hook up with quarterback Jim Zorn to the tune of 66 catches, 1,237 yards, nine touchdowns, and an 18.7 YPC average.

Unfortunately, Largent’s NFL career labors in relative obscurity. The Seahawks toiled within the shadows of the Pacific Northwest, alongside its much more celebrated AFC West rivals -- during his time with Seattle, Largent saw the Chargers, Broncos, Chiefs, and Raiders all find more success than the Seahawks.

<h2>7. Terrell Owens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_554857" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="size-full wp-image-554857" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Terrell-Owens_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Like him or not, there's no denying T.O.'s gifts on the field | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Like him or not, there's no denying T.O.'s gifts on the field | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL fans may scoff at including T.O. in any discussion about "greatness," since Owens became a caricature -- a diva more concerned with glamor than with winning. Many will forever associate him with the word “touches” and constant demands for the football.

Off the field, he often played into the media hype, shouting at his teammates and doing sit-ups in the driveway. His hysterics led to bad feelings and regrets in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Dallas. Looking past the traveling circus, though, and his game is more than adequate.

A 6-foot-3, 226-pound specimen,  T.O. was too physical to be covered by corners and too fast to be matched up against safeties. Owens used his body to shield defenders and make catches, before powering through opponents to the sticks. Owens is a future Hall of Famer, who currently ranks in the top 10 for all-time receptions (<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/O/OwenTe00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sixth with 1,078</a>) and yards (second with 15,934).

Despite his physical prowess and gamesmanship (notably playing through a broken leg in the 2005 Super Bowl), Owens received criticism for being "soft." He led the league in drops while he was with Dallas. Of course, T.O. fans insist that he is just misunderstood.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Lynn Swann</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681951" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681951" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/657955.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="457" /> Lynn Swann at the Hall of Fame. | Elsa/AllSport/Getty Images[/caption]

Wide receiver Lynn Swann finished his Hall of Fame career with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SwanLy00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">336 catches for 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns</a>. Even though those numbers look rather pedestrian compared to the high-octane offenses of the modern era, his efforts still helped bring home four Super Bowl rings that will always make Swann a hero to Steeler Nation.

In Super Bowl X, Swann caught four catches for 161 yards and MVP honors. His Super Bowl X showing included a diving shoestring catch that has become part of NFL lore. He went airborne, entangled with Cowboy Mark Washington, and still managed to snag Terry Bradshaw’s deep bomb at the last second.

NFL fans associate him with speed, agility, and grace. That said, Swann never topped the 1,000-yard mark in any one season during the Golden Era of smash mouth football. We can only speculate in regards to his legacy were he to have performed with different teammates amidst a different era.

<h2>5. Michael Irvin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_509419" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-509419 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Emmitt-Smith_Michael-Irvin.jpg" alt="PASADENA - JANUARY 31: Emmitt Smith #22 and Michael Irvin #88 of the Dallas Cowboys celebrate on January 31, 1993 during the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXVII in Pasadena, California.

Michael Irvin was as close as the NFL has ever come to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. On the field, he was a winner -- recognized on account of his tireless work ethic and enthusiasm to get down and dirty at wide receiver, sacrificing his body to block, catch balls across the middle, and maul cornerbacks at the line of scrimmage.

Off the field, Irvin received charges for cocaine possession and battery, alongside allegations of sexual assault. Despite his prevalence for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, Irvin gained a reputation as a mentor for younger NFL players and student-athletes at the University of Miami.

At The U, Irvin finished his three-year career as the most decorated Hurricane wideout ever, including winning one National Championship. In the pros, Dallas reunited Irvin with head coach Jimmy Johnson. They won three Super Bowls to go with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/I/IrviMi00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11,904 receiving yards</a> as Cowboys. Those '90s Cowboys teams also featured Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman.

Dallas’s offensive attack rejected gimmicks and simply destroyed competition by fielding better talent, and NFL fans would be hard-pressed to forget Pat Summerall’s monotone throughout those epic Cowboys/49ers match-ups: "Michael Irvin… Across the middle… He’s got it… Shaking loose into the secondary… Touchdown… Aikman to Michael Irvin."<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Tim Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681954" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681954" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1676135.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="506" /> Wide receiver Tim Brown runs with the ball. | Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

Tim Brown may be best described as the poor man’s Jerry Rice. Mr. Raider returned kicks, took reverses, and caught passes as a threat to score from anywhere on the football field at any time. A Heisman winner while he was at Notre Dame, Brown racked up <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowTi00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,094 catches to go for 14,934 yards</a> and 100 touchdowns in his career -- and also led the NFL in all-purpose yards in 1988 as a rookie.

Combining enough speed to blaze pass cornerbacks with the physical mettle to curl up into short zones and duel with linebackers, Brown excelled as a skilled wide receiver in Oakland and Los Angeles, where his knowledge of the position stood in sharp contrast to Al Davis’s predisposition to strap shoulder pads onto track stars and tell them they were now wide receivers.

Brown’s career may not resonate with the casual fan because of the dysfunction at Raider Nation, but Brown showcased as much natural talent as any man to ever play the position, save only Randy Moss.

<h2>3. Randy Moss</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590864" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590864" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Randy-Moss-Miami-Dolphins-v-New-England-Patriots-otS6QkBxp5Ql.jpg" alt="Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="525" /> Randy Moss was a one-in-a-lifetime NFL talent | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

"The Freak" rivals Deion Sanders and Bo Jackson as one of the greatest athletes to wear the NFL shield. Standing 6-foot-4, Randy Moss was clocked at 4.25 seconds in the 40-yard dash and also lettered in basketball, baseball, and track and field as a schoolboy in West Virginia.

Extracurricular concerns landed Moss at Marshall University, where he won the Fred Biletnikoff Award and became a stalwart of the highlight reel circus, as his physical gifts enabled him to leap past defenders for deep bombs, hurdle felled bodies, and outrace any corner into the end zone. While his immaturity caused his draft stock to plummet, Moss was eventually selected by the Minnesota Vikings with the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MossRa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21st overall pick in the 1998 draft</a>.

From there on out, Moss built his career by proving the naysayers wrong. He teamed with Cris Carter and Jake Reed to take the league by storm in '98. Moss tallied 1,313 yards on 69 catches for 17 touchdowns (breaking the rookie record) as the Vikings went 15-1. As a receiver, Moss transformed the likes of Randall Cunningham, Brad Johnson, and Geoff George from washed-up has-beens into ageless wonders at quarterback.

The NFL had never seen anything like this. Moss could turn a quick screen into 70 yards and a touchdown. Never mind double- and even triple-coverage, a quarterback could throw it up, and Moss would go get it. After his Minnesota breakout and a debacle in Oakland, he took his show on the road to New England.

The 2007 Patriots scored 589 total points -- breaking the old record Moss helped set with the Vikings in 1998 as he snagged a record 23 touchdown passes from Tom Brady and helped the Patriots go undefeated all the way to the Super Bowl. Beyond his physical gifts, Moss considered himself a student of the game. His ability to read coverage and get open is underrated; Bill “The Hood” Belichick described Moss as the most intelligent receiver he has coached.

<h2>2. Don Hutson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_681962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681962" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/don-hutson_pg_600.jpg" alt="The 10 Greatest NFL Wide Receivers of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Don Hutson on the field. | Source: NFL.com[/caption]

Hailed as the man who introduced football to the forward pass, Don Hutson dominated the wide receiver role like no other man has lorded over any position in all of sports. His post corners, slants, and square-in routes laid the groundwork for wide receivers to impact the game of football. This Packer led the NFL in receptions and yardage for seven and eight of his 11 seasons, respectively.

Hutson retired as the all-time leader in every significant wide receiver metric and watched his records stand for decades. Few things resonate more with football fans than statistical dominance, after all. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HutsDo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 1942</a>, in just 11 games, Hutson caught 74 balls for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns, roughly tripling the output of his closest competitors (Pop Ivy made 27 catches for the Chicago Cardinals and Ray McLean accounted for 571 yards receiving for the Bears).

This point can work for or against Hutson, though, since any discussion of the man must recognize the fact that the league’s passing game was primitive, at best. Wile Hutson is one of the greatest players to ever wear football cleats, we weight his legacy against the fact that the opposing defenses of the 1940s were far from sophisticated.

<h2>1. Jerry Rice</h2>
[caption id="attachment_580675" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580675" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Jerry-Rice-DOUG-COLLIER-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="DOUG COLLIER/AFP/Getty Images MIAMI, FL - JANUARY 29: San Francisco 49er wide receiver Jerry Rice (R) runs past San Diego Chargers Stanley Richard (L) and Darren Carrington (C) to score a first-quarter touchdown 29 January 1995 during Super Bowl XXIX at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami.

Hollywood could not have scripted a better story for Jerry Rice, the son of a bricklayer, who was never offered an NCAA Division I-A scholarship out of high school. Going on to star at wide receiver for tiny Mississippi Valley State University -- putting up numbers you might see in a video game in Division I-AA -- Rice saw his collegiate accolades dismissed by NFL scouts, who saw a player who was too small and too slow to make an impact at the professional level.

Dismissed by everyone save Bill Walsh and the San Francisco 49ers, who came calling with the 16th pick in the 1985 Draft, Walsh installed Rice as the key component of the West Coast offense -- a system predicated upon short timing routes and mismatches that allow the receiver to earn chunks of yardage after the catch (This term arrived into the football lexicon during John Madden's descriptions of Rice's play).

Even though the term is a cliche at this point, Jerry Rice really could "do it all." His 1,549 career receptions (an NFL record) demonstrate his knack for getting open and catching the football, while his 208 career touchdowns (another record) highlight his nose for the end zone and the big play.

He once scored 22 touchdowns in a 12-game 1987 strike-shortened season. In a young man's game that is so damaging, they can only do it 16 times a season; Rice hauled in 122 catches for 1,848 yards as a 33-year old.

His exercise regimen only added to the legend: No. 80 was known to sprint 2.5 miles worth of Bay Area hills per session, hit the bike immediately prior to game time, and leave other professional athletes in tatters after participating in his five-hour workouts. This dedication served as the foundation for Rice’s 20-year NFL career, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiceJe00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22,895 receiving yards</a>, and iconic status as one of the world’s premier athletes.

		<description><![CDATA[Ezekiel Elliott has been outstanding during his first professional season. Is he having the best rookie season by a running back in NFL history? ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_715284" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-715284" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ezekiel-Elliott_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott has taken the NFL by storm | Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="800" height="534" /> Ezekiel Elliott has taken the NFL by storm | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Very few players are able to enter the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Football League</a> and play at a Pro Bowl level right away. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-best-rookie-seasons-by-a-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rookies in the NFL</a> face massive amounts of pressure to live up to the lofty expectations that come with being high draft picks or having record-breaking college careers. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-worst-nfl-players-ever.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some guys can handle it, others cannot</a>. Even the players that are able to come in and contribute at a high level in their first professional season almost always experience a great deal of growing pains on their road to NFL stardom.

One of the few positions where players can make an almost seamless transition from the college level to the professional level is running back. The simple truth of the matter is that running backs can rely more heavily on their natural running ability and vision than their rookie teammates at other positions. Other position groups have a much more difficult time adjusting to the speed of the game, pro-style schemes, and more complex terminology of NFL offenses and defenses.

Some of the greatest rookie seasons in NFL history have come at the hands of some of the greatest running backs in NFL history. In fact, it is not that uncommon to see ball carriers eclipse the 1,000-yard mark in their first professional season. And after only nine games in his first professional season, Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott has <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/ElliEz00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already accomplished that feat</a>.

Here is a quick rundown on Elliott’s stats through entering the 2016 postseason:
<ul>
 	<li>322 carries</li>
 	<li>1,631 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>5.1 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>108.7 rushing yards per game</li>
 	<li>15 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>32 receptions</li>
 	<li>363 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>1 touchdown reception</li>
</ul>
The Cowboys can attribute a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/reasons-why-dallas-cowboys-can-win-super-bowl-51.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great deal of their success</a> this season to the emergence of Elliott. The former Ohio State standout is one of the top three running backs in the league (he’s joined by Le’Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers and David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals), he has already earned All-Pro honors, and he is very much in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ezekiel-elliott-nfl-mvp-candidate.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contention for the 2016 NFL MVP and Offensive Rookie of the Year awards</a>. With that being the case, is it safe to say that Elliott is the best rookie running back in NFL history?

Here’s how his season compares to the previous seven best rookie running back seasons of all-time.

<h2>1.  Earl Campbell — 1978</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUWLVE-UvqE?rel=0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>302 carries</li>
 	<li>1,450 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4.8 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>13 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>12 receptions</li>
 	<li>48 receiving yards</li>
</ul>
The Houston Oilers made Campbell the No. 1 overall pick in the 1978 NFL Draft out of the University of Texas, and were anything but disappointed with The Tyler Rose’s performance in his first professional season. As a rookie, Campbell led the NFL in rushing yards, was named a first-team All-Pro, won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year award. He would go on to play eight seasons in the NFL and was a Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee in 1991.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>297 carries</li>
 	<li>1,487 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>5.0 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>15 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>23 receptions</li>
 	<li>169 receiving yards</li>
</ul>
Anderson took an <a title="Marine Boot Camp to NFL Stardom" href="https://www.incharge.org/military-money/story/backstage-with-mike-anderson-from-marine-boot-camp-to-nfl-big-bucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconventional road to NFL stardom</a>. After not playing sports in high school, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after his high school graduation. Anderson first played football for one the intramural teams within the Marines, where he caught the eye of a junior college coach in California. After completing four years in the Marines, he attended Mt. San Jacinto Junior College and played football both years before transferring to the University of Utah. Anderson was a star in his two seasons at Utah, and went on to be selected in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos as a 27-year-old.

In his rookie season, Anderson didn’t assume the Broncos’ full-time starting role until a month into the season. When he finally stepped into the starting lineup, Anderson took the league by storm. He would go on to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award, in what would ultimately end up being the best season of his professional career.

<h2>3.  Barry Sanders — 1989</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789442" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789442 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Barry-Sanders.jpg" alt="MATT CAMPBELL/Getty Images" width="757" height="985" /> MATT CAMPBELL/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>280 carries</li>
 	<li>1,470 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>14 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>5.3 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>24 receptions</li>
 	<li>282 receiving yards</li>
</ul>
It should really come as no surprise to see Sanders’s name on this list. In his 10 NFL seasons, Sanders never finished with less than 1,100 yards on the ground, and made the Pro Bowl every year. As a rookie, he came in and dominated right from the start. In addition to putting up ridiculous stats, he also won the 1989 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Sanders remains one of the most explosive players to ever play in the NFL.

<h2>4.  Eric Dickerson — 1983</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bi1YALBcoFw?rel=0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>390 carries</li>
 	<li>1,808 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4.6 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>18 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>51 receptions</li>
 	<li>404 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>2 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Dickerson burst onto the NFL scene as a rookie in a big way in 1983. He not only posted what may have been the best season by a rookie – regardless of position – in NFL history, but it was also one of the best seasons by any running back in NFL history. The 1999 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee led the league in rushing yards with just over 1,800, and ran for career-high 18 touchdowns in his first NFL season. For his efforts, he was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, the NFL Offensive Player of the Year, and the NFL’s Most Valuable Player.

<h2>5.  Adrian Peterson — 2007</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789447" align="aligncenter" width="691"]<img class="wp-image-789447 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Adrian-Peterson_ROY.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="691" height="1024" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>238 carries</li>
 	<li>1,341 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>5.6 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>12 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>19 receptions</li>
 	<li>268 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>1 touchdown reception</li>
</ul>
Peterson appeared in 14 games and only made nine starts as a rookie in 2007, but that was enough for him to rush for over 1,300 yards and take home the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. By the end of the season, Peterson had proven to be one of the premier backs in the NFL. In Minnesota’s Week 9 game against the San Diego Chargers, Peterson had one of the best games by a running back in NFL history. He ran for an NFL single-game record 296 yards and added 3 touchdowns on 30 carries.

<h2>6.  Edgerrin James — 1999</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789452" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789452 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/edgerrin-james.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="797" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li>13 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>62 receptions</li>
 	<li>586 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>4 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
The Indianapolis Colts shocked the football world when they drafted James over the much more heralded Ricky Williams in the 1999 NFL Draft. The move paid off in a big a big way for the Colts, as James would prove to be the perfect compliment to Peyton Manning in Indianapolis’ high-powered offense. The former Miami Hurricane would go on to earn his first Pro Bowl selection and win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award after putting up over 2,100 yards of total offense and 17 total touchdowns.

<h2>7.  Gale Sayers — 1965</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNy7SvrLE9w?rel=0"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>166 carries</li>
 	<li>867 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>5.2 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>14 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>29 receptions</li>

 	<li>6 touchdown receptions</li>
 	<li>14.9 yards per punt return</li>
 	<li>1 punt return touchdown</li>
 	<li>31.4 yards per kickoff return</li>
 	<li>1 kickoff return touchdown</li>
</ul>
From day one of his NFL career, Sayers was one of the most dominant players in the entire league. As a rookie, he made his presence felt in almost every phase of the game. Sayers was explosive as a ball carrier, as a receiver out of the backfield and in the slot, and as a punt and kickoff returner. In his rookie year, he totaled 2,272 all-purpose yards and was responsible for a total of 23 touchdowns that came in five different forms – rushing, receiving, kickoff return, punt return, and a touchdown pass. The 1977 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee would earn All-Pro honors and win the NFL Rookie of the Year award.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_947531" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-947531" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Brett-Favre_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre looks for a target." width="757" height="497" /> Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre was easily inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the greatest honors a professional football player <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-10-current-players-who-are-locks-to-make-the-hall-of-fame.html/">can receive is being elected</a> into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It is an even bigger honor for a player to be elected in his first year of eligibility.

In 2016, the only player we saw earn first-ballot Hall of Fame induction status was longtime Green Bay Packers quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">Brett Favre</a>, who held <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-unbreakable-records.html/">nearly every major NFL passing record</a> at the time of his retirement. Favre’s election ensured that we will see a player inducted into the Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility for the fourth consecutive year. Warren Sapp, Larry Allen, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top%C2%AD-10-greatest-nfl-offensive-linemen-of-all%C2%AD-time.html/">Jonathan Ogden</a> accomplished the feat in 2013; Walter Jones and Derrick Brooks pulled it off in 2014; and the late Junior Seau was bestowed with the honor in 2015.

Now that the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2016 <a title="Brett Favre highlights Hall of Fame Class of 2016" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000633489/article/brett-favre-highlights-hall-of-fame-class-of-2016" target="_blank">is in the books</a>, we look at next year’s class, more specifically, the players who have a chance of being elected in their first year of eligibility. Here are the six most notable players who will be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the first time this year, and our take on their chances of earning induction in the Class of 2017.

<h2>1. LaDainian Tomlinson, running back</h2>

<h2>Career stats:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>13,684 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4.3 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>145 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>624 receptions</li>
 	<li>4,772 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>17 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>2006 NFL MVP</li>

 	<li>6-time All-Pro</li>

 	<li>5th-most rushing yards in NFL history</li>
</ul>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzqUvuS7e9c"></iframe>
Simply put, we would be shocked if LaDainian Tomlinson is not a first-ballot choice for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He is one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-running-backs-of-all-time.html/">most dynamic running backs</a> the league has ever seen, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-7-highest-paid-nfl-running-backs-of-all-time.html/">playing at an extremely high level</a> for almost a decade. In 2006, the former TCU Horned Frog turned in one of the greatest single seasons by a running back in NFL history, rushing for 1,815 yards and 28 touchdowns while also catching 56 passes for 508 yards and three receiving touchdowns. All said, it would be a crime if Tomlinson is not part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2017.

<h2>2. Donovan McNabb, quarterback</h2>

<h2>Career stats:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>37,276 passing yards</li>
 	<li>234 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>117 interceptions</li>
 	<li>85.6 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>3,459 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>29 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>98-62-1 regular season record</li>
 	<li>5 NFC Championship Game appearances</li>
 	<li>1 Super Bowl appearance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>6-time Pro Bowler</li>
 	<li>NFC Player of the Year (2004)</li>
</ul>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUJv4VwM5qY"></iframe>
While he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/20-of-the-most-unbelievable-finishes-in-nfl-history.html/">had an excellent career</a>, we highly doubt that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-the-nfls-greatest-mobile-quarterbacks.html/">Donovan McNabb</a> will be a first-ballot entrant into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. When it comes down to it, his resume is missing the ever-important Super Bowl title, and his career statistics do little to strengthen his case. On top of that, we firmly believe that Kurt Warner is worthy of induction before McNabb. That said, we are confident that McNabb will eventually have a bronze bust in Canton, Ohio several years down the road.

<h2>3. Chad Johnson, wide receiver</h2>
[caption id="attachment_947551" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-947551" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Chad-Johnson_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="534" /> Chad Johnson will be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame one day | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li>67 touchdown receptions</li>
 	<li>14.4 yards per reception</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>
<ul>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jvk6r0cW5ss"></iframe>
There is no arguing that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-players-perform-dancing-stars.html/">Chad Johnson</a> has a Hall of Fame-caliber career resume. We are confident that he will wear a gold jacket sometime in the near future. However, we just don’t believe that his resume is strong enough for him to be elected in his first year of eligibility. On that note, there may not be a Pro Football Hall of Fame acceptance speech we look forward to more than Johnson's <span class="s1">-- </span>whenever that day comes.

<h2>4. Brian Dawkins, safety</h2>

<h2>Career stats:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>895 solo tackles</li>
 	<li>236 assists on tackles</li>
 	<li>36 forced fumbles</li>
 	<li>19 fumble recoveries</li>
 	<li>37 interceptions</li>
 	<li>26 sacks</li>
 	<li>3 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>

 	<li>6-time All-Pro</li>
</ul>
<!--nextpage-->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IS3TgM4xegk"></iframe>
Brian Dawkins was one of the best safeties in the game for the vast majority of his 16 NFL seasons. On top of being a dominant player, Dawkins was also one of the most emotional, fiery leaders the league has ever seen. Like Johnson, we believe that Dawkins is a lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but he will not be elected in his first year of eligibility. Look for the longtime Philadelphia Eagle to be enshrined in Canton sometime within the next five years.

<h2>5. Jason Taylor, defensive end</h2>
[caption id="attachment_947552" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-947552" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jason-Taylor_Al-Bello_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jason Taylor smiles as he adjusts his gloves." width="757" height="505" /> Jason Taylor has a legitimate chance at being a first-ballot Hall of Famer | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Career stats:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>139.5 sacks</li>
 	<li>525 solo tackles</li>
 	<li>250 assists on tackles</li>
 	<li>46 forced fumbles</li>
 	<li>29 fumble recoveries</li>
 	<li>8 interceptions</li>
 	<li>9 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>6-time Pro Bowler</li>
 	<li>4-time All-Pro</li>
 	<li>2-time AFC Defensive Player of the Year</li>
 	<li>NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2006)</li>
 	<li>Walter Payton Man of the Year (2007)</li>
</ul>
<!--nextpage-->

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByJWqV8Gq-c"></iframe>
Jason Taylor will likely join the prestigious list of first-ballot Hall of Famers. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-miami-dolphins-ever.html/">longtime Miami Dolphins defensive end</a> finished his career with the sixth-most sacks in NFL history (Julius Peppers has since knocked him down to seventh place on the all-time list). Taylor was one of the most dominating defensive players in the league for close to a decade. When it comes down to it, he should be a no-brainer pick for the Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee.

<h2>6. Hines Ward</h2>
[caption id="attachment_757503" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-757503" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-108870108-1024x683.jpg" alt="Hines Ward of the Pittsburgh Steelers reacts after a play in Super Bowl XLV." width="757" height="505" /> Hines Ward has a legitimate chance at being named a first-ballot Hall of Famer | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Career stats:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>1,000 receptions</li>
 	<li>12,083 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>85 touchdown receptions</li>
 	<li>12.1 yards per reception</li>
</ul>
<h2>Career honors:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>4-time Pro Bowler</li>
 	<li>3-time All-Pro</li>
 	<li>2-time Super Bowl champion</li>
</ul>
<!--nextpage-->
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KPC5SbfMLw"></iframe>
Hines Ward joins Tomlinson and Taylor as players we believe have a strong case to become first-ballot Hall of Famers in 2017. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-pittsburgh-steelers-of-all-time.html/">longtime Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver</a> embodies everything you could ask of a professional football player. Before emerging <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-wild-card-teams-that-won-the-super-bowl.html/">as an elite receiver</a>, Ward made a name for himself as a standout on special teams and was also one of the rare wideouts who took pride in his blocking.

When he retired, Ward held nearly every receiving record in Steelers history. He was one of only 12 wide receivers in NFL history to record 1,000 or more career receptions. In summation, the selection committee will have a hard time explaining themselves if they leave Ward out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.

		<description><![CDATA[The San Francisco 49ers and Colin Kaepernick parted ways this offseason. Here's a look at 8 potential landing spots for the six-year NFL veteran.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_621228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621228" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Colin-Kaepernick_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Colin Kaepernick stands on the sidelines while donning a 49ers cap." width="757" height="504" /> Colin Kaepernick's time with the San Francisco 49ers will likely come to an end soon | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Speculation regarding <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/disliked-nfl-players-today.html/">Colin Kaepernick</a>’s future in the NFL has running rampant since the end of the 2015 season. While<span class="message_content"> the 28-year-old signal caller has flashed signs of brilliance during his five-year NFL career, inconsistencies in his on-field performance</span> and <a title="Kaepernick Needs to Grow Up" href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/07/08/ron-jaworski-herm-edwards-rip-kaepernicks-hat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signs of immaturity</a> have led many people around the league to question his long-term viability as a franchise quarterback.

The 49ers locked up Kaepernick <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-contracts-nfl-history.html/">to a long-term extension</a> prior to the 2014 season, but thanks to a recent contract restructure, the two sides were able to officially part ways <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-signed-100-million-contracts.html/">with minimal financial impact</a> this offseason.

There should be some interest in Kaepernick on the open market, despite the fact that he went 3-16 in his last 19 starts. He proves that he can win games (both regular and postseason) at the NFL level, and possesses a rare and unique physical skill set. A quick look at his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KaepCo00/gamelog/2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 stat line</a> proves that Kaepernick is still fully capable of leading an NFL offense.

With that said, Kaepernick's could very well find himself in a backup role with his next team. Either way, here are eight potential landing spots for Kaepernick in 2017.

Last offseason, shortly after the Browns hired Hue Jackson as their next head coach, Kaepernick <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-changing-teams-2017.html/">expressed an interest in moving</a> to Cleveland. The Browns eventually settled on Robert Griffin III as the solution to their quarterback woes, but he spent the bulk of the 2016 season on the team's Injured Reserve list. With Griffin getting the ax earlier this offseason, the Browns are clearly in the market for another quarterback this offseason.

<h2>2. Indianapolis Colts</h2>

Make no mistake about it: This is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">Andrew Luck</a>'s team and likely will be for the next 10 or 15 years. That said, 2015 taught us that Luck isn't immune from the injury bug. And with Scott Tolzien as the only other experienced quarterback on their roster, the Colts could undoubtedly use an experienced backup who knows how to win in the NFL.

We're not sure how likely the Colts would be to bring in a controversial player such as Kaepernick -- especially since their owner Jim Irsay <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/10/19/jim-irsay-on-protests-there-are-other-places-to-express-yourself/">isn't a fan</a> of players kneeling during the National Anthem -- but we do know that the Nevada Wolfpack legend would be an upgrade over Tolzien as the team's backup quarterback.

<h2>3. Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_545010" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-545010" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Russell-Wilson_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Russell Wilson kneels before a play and looks at the camera." width="757" height="577" /> Colin Kaepernick would be an excellent backup quarterback option to Russell Wilson for the Seattle Seahawks | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

For this scenario to happen, Kaepernick would have to be willing to go to a team that he once considered his most bitter rival in the NFL. He'd also have to accept the fact that he wouldn't see the field without an injury to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-tom-brady.html/">Russell Wilson</a>. With that being the case, Kaepernick landing with the Seahawks is clearly a long shot (at best). But from purely a skill-set perspective, the six-year NFL veteran would fit well in Seattle's offensive system.

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Update: The Seattle Seahawks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/06/05/seahawks-pass-on-colin-kaepernick-sign-austin-davis-as-backup-qb/?utm_term=.e6f66629513c">passed on Kaepernick</a> in favor of quarterback Austin Davis.</span></i>

<h2>4. Los Angeles Rams</h2>

There is no doubt that Jared Goff is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-boring-nfl-teams-to-watch-this-season.html/">Los Angeles Rams</a>' future quarterback. However, the jury is still out on Goff's long-term viability as a starter. Adding a player such as Kaepernick would not only give the Rams some insurance, but it would also give them a veteran with some credibility to mentor Goff in their quarterback meeting room.

<h2>5. New Orleans Saints</h2>

This scenario is all about the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-nfl-teams-that-have-choked-away-the-most-wins-in-nfl-history.html/">New Orleans Saints</a> needing a dynamic, starting-caliber backup to 38-year-old Drew Brees. Their 2015 third-round draft pick, Garrett Grayson,<span class="s1"> </span>who spent the 2016 season on their practice squad,<span class="s1"> </span>still has a long ways to go. Luke McCown likely won't lead the team to many wins. Furthermore, with some time <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/drew-brees-rank-nfl-history.html/">to learn from Brees</a> and New Orleans head coach Sean Payton, Kaepernick may be able to resurrect his NFL career.

The Bills recently committed themselves to Tyrod Taylor (for at least the next two years), which means that Kaepernick would have to be willing to accept a backup role for this scenario to come to fruition. Nonetheless, with Taylor's playing style (he is one of the better running quarterbacks in the league), he is one his away from suffering an injury that could keep him out of action for an extended period of time. Buffalo could use a capable backup, and Kaepernick would come with the added benefit of having a very similar skillset to Taylor.

<h2>7. Houston Texans</h2>

The Texans <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-who-were-massively-overpaid-in-2016.html/">threw big money at Brock Osweiler</a> last offseason in a move that turned out to be one of the worst free<em>-</em>agent signings in NFL history. And now, after one season with Osweiler running the show, Houston is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/houston-texans-need-to-pull-plug-on-brock-osweiler.html/">back in the market</a> for a franchise quarterback.

While Kaepernick may not be a significant upgrade over Osweiler, he does have a better track record of winning games when he has a strong supporting cast. This one will all come down to whether or not Houston lands Tony Romo.

<h2>8. New York Jets</h2>

It's no secret that the Jets are in the market for a new quarterback. The Ryan Fitzpatrick era is over, Geno Smith is now a member of the New York Giants, and there is no telling whether or not Bryce Petty and Christian Hackenberg have what it takes to guide the Gang Green back to the postseason.

Kaepernick would make sense here (we think the Jets would do better with Jay Cutler, though) as a bridge until the Jets find their long-term answer at the most important position in football.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_635542" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-635542" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Aaron-Rodgers_Mike-McGinnis_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="How Do Aaron Rodgers' Stats Stack Up Against the All-Time Greats?" width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers has a place waiting for him in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

Aaron Rodgers is good. Like really, really, really good. And he has the stats to back it up. In fact, if you ask us, the Green Bay Packers signal caller is currently the best offensive player in all of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, but that’s a story for another day.

Given his prowess, it’s safe to assume that the Packers will be among the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-li.html/" target="_blank">top Super Bowl contenders</a> in the league as long as they have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-aaron-rodgers.html/" target="_blank">Rodgers</a> under center. After taking over for Brett Favre as the Packers’ starting quarterback in 2008, Rodgers wasted little time establishing himself as one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-best-offensive-players-in-the-nfc-north.html/" target="_blank">game’s premier players</a>.

In his eight seasons as the team’s starter, the former Cal standout has won two <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-the-2016-mvp-award.html/" target="_blank">NFL MVP awards</a>, earned five Pro Bowl and three All-Pro selections, and was named the MVP of Super Bowl XLV after leading the Packers to the fourth Super Bowl title (and 13th total world championship) in franchise history.

He was <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000770458/article/three-rookies-matt-ryan-among-players-named-to-allpro-team" target="_blank">recently edged out</a> by Matt Ryan and Tom Brady in the voting for the 2016 AP All-Pro team, but there is really no arguing that Rodgers is currently playing at a higher level than every other quarterback in the league. Over the last seven weeks, the 6-foot-2, 223-pounder has led the Packers to a 6-1 record while completing 69.7% of his passes for 2,018 yards, 18 touchdowns and zero interceptions, and added another 143 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Because of his performance down the stretch, there is a very good chance that Rodgers will take home NFL MVP honors and lead his team on a deep postseason run.

If Rodgers captures another NFL MVP award and/or another Super Bowl title in the coming weeks, his case for being one of the best signal callers in league history will only grow stronger. While it is painfully obvious that Rodgers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/" target="_blank">has a spot waiting for him</a> in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, his standing among the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time is still up in the air.

At 33 years old, Rodgers probably has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-quarterbacks-who-will-have-the-best-2016-seasons.html/" target="_blank">enough gas left in his tank</a> to produce at least five more Pro Bowl-caliber seasons before his career comes to an end. If that proves to be the truth, he will undoubtedly have a career stat line that compares closely to guys like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, and Brett Favre.

With all that being said, Rodgers's statistical resume is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-bold-predictions-for-the-green-bay-packers-in-2016.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">far from complete</a>. In this article we are going to take a look at how his current best single-season and career stats stack up against the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.

<h2>Rodgers' best single-season stats (2011)</h2>

<ul>
 	<li>15 starts</li>
 	<li>14-1 regular season record</li>
 	<li>68.3% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>4,643 passing yards</li>

</ul>
<a href="http://www.jsonline.com/sports/rodgers-statistically-out-of-this-world-754adiu-140244583.html" target="_blank">Rodgers’ 2011 season</a> is without a doubt one of the <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/cam-newton-carolina-panthers-mvp-statistics-history" target="_blank">top-five single season performances</a> by a quarterback in NFL history. His passer rating that season (122.5) is still a single-season league record, and the 48 total touchdowns he accounted for ranks as the fourth-highest total in NFL history. What may have been his most impressive stat, though, was his 7.5:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio.

The Chico, Calif. native led the Packers to a 15-1 regular season record, but “The Pack” was ultimately <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=320115009" target="_blank">upset in their first game of the NFC Playoffs</a> by the New York Giants, who went on to win that year’s Super Bowl title. Despite falling short in the postseason, Rodgers 2011 season was one for the ages.

<h2>Rodgers' career stats</h2>

<ul>
 	<li>135 starts</li>
 	<li>90-45 regular season record</li>
 	<li>65.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>36,827 passing yards</li>
 	<li>297 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>72 interceptions</li>
 	<li>104.1 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>7.9 yards per pass attempt</li>
 	<li>2,544 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>25 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
When it comes to career stats, Rodgers isn’t <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-most-popular-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank">quite in the same class</a> as guys like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Brett Favre, or Dan Marino. He does, however, compare closely to guys like John Elway, Fran Tarkenton, Joe Montana, and Johnny Unitas, and has already surpassed guys like Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, Steve Young, and Jim Kelly.

With that being said, it’s not totally fair to statistically compare players from different eras given the changes in offensive schemes throughout the years. It’s also not really fair to compare Rodgers -- whose body of work is far from complete -- to the best quarterbacks in NFL history.

Nonetheless, if you project Rodgers’ stats over the next five-plus seasons based on his averages of his eight seasons as a full-time starter, he will easily retire with a stat line that compares favorably to the greatest signal callers in league history.

<h2>Career postseason stats</h2>
[caption id="attachment_654432" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-654432" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Aaron-Rodgers_Timothy-A.-Clary_Getty-Images-1-624x500.jpg" alt="How Do Aaron Rodgers' Stats Stack Up Against the All-Time Greats?" width="757" height="607" /> Throughout his career, Aaron Rodgers has proven that he can thrive in postseason situations. | Timothy A. Clary/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>13 starts</li>
 	<li>7-6 postseason record</li>
 	<li>63.8% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>27 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>8 interceptions</li>
 	<li>98.2 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>7.4 yards per pass attempt</li>
 	<li>212 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>3 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
Rodgers’ career postseason stats send a clear message that the 2011 Associated Press Athlete of the Year thrives in big-game situations. His numbers are right in line with what an elite quarterback’s regular-season numbers would (and should) look like, and he already has the all-important Super Bowl title on his resume.

When it’s all said and done, Rodgers could eventually cement his place as one of the top two or three postseason quarterbacks of all time.

In reality, Rodgers will likely <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">never catch Tom Brady</a> in any of the major postseason statistical categories that quarterbacks are judged by. He could, however, easily end up in second place in most categories if he can lead the Packers on a few more deep postseason runs.

		<description><![CDATA[Baltimore lost their first team in 1984, but the Ravens have done the city of Baltimore proud since touching down in 1996 thanks to these players.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color: #000000">In 1984, Robert Irsay packed up his NFL team and abandoned Baltimore, leaving it behind for the bright lights of Indianapolis. For years, Baltimore City residents were haunted by images of their beloved Colts skipping town on that snowy night. Their heartbreak largely came to an end in 1996, when a series of moves brought the Cleveland Browns to Charm City. </span>

<span style="color: #000000">In Baltimore, the old Cleveland Browns were rechristened the Ravens, and went on to post one of the more successful runs in NFL history. Perennial contenders, the Ravens brought home two Super Bowl championships, in 2000 and 2012. Ravens football was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-should-the-ravens-give-trent-richardson-another-chance.html/" target="_blank">built upon savvy player personnel moves</a>, conservative quarterback play, and hard-hitting defense above all else. </span>
<h2>1. Ray Lewis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_771767" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-771767 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lewis-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

From 1996 until 2012, Ray Lewis was the face of the Baltimore Ravens. In Baltimore, the defensive scheme actually began up front, where the likes of man-eating tackles Tony Siragusa and Heloti Ngata would occupy multiple blockers. From there, Lewis was left free to flow toward the football and blow up ball carriers at the point of attack. Calling himself “God’s Linebacker," Lewis’s uncanny ability to diagnose plays was equally impressive as his physical tools, and topped 100 tackles through eight separate seasons.

In 2000, Lewis led <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/2000.htm" target="_blank">one of the most dominant defenses of all time</a>, as the Ravens gave up a mere 10 points per game. In the Divisional Playoff, Lewis went chest-to-chest against Eddie George in press coverage, before intercepting the football, and heading off 50-yards in the other direction for the game clinching touchdown. From there, Lewis went on to take Super Bowl XXXV MVP honors, and would lead the Ravens to another Super Bowl in 2012 before announcing his retirement.

<h2>2. Ed Reed</h2>
[caption id="attachment_771781" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-771781 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ed-Reed-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Ed Reed will go down as one of the greatest safeties of all time. In his prime, Reed credited his success to a photographic memory that gave him the ability to diagnose plays and make real-time adjustments. Vintage Reed was known to hang back in the secondary, baiting quarterbacks to test him deep, and then immediately break on the football, to come down with the interception.

In all, Reed picked off 64 passes for 1,590 return yards and 7 touchdowns <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/ReedEd00.htm" target="_blank">through 11 years of service in Baltimore</a>, leading the league in interceptions three times — in 2004, 2008, and 2010.
<h2>3. Jonathan Ogden</h2>
The 1996 NFL Draft proved to be a defining moment for general manager Ozzie Newsome and the Baltimore Ravens, as the franchise picked up both Jonathan Ogden and Ray Lewis, with the 4th and 26th overall picks, respectively. In Ogden, the Ravens picked up a “can’t miss” prospect out of UCLA, who <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/O/OgdeJo00.htm" target="_blank">went on to make 11 Pro Bowls</a>. As a rookie, Ogden was immediately installed as the starting left guard, before ultimately sliding over and earning his keep at left tackle.

At 6-foot-9, 340 pounds, Ogden was a wall of a man that could also drop his hips to chase down defensive ends out on the edge, and drive them into the ground, and would often make it out to the second level, where he would maul linebackers at the point of attack. He was also part of the 2000 Ravens team who went on to claim Super Bowl glory.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Joe Flacco</h2>
[caption id="attachment_714785" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-714785 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457499078-e1413989894497.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Mitchell Layton/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2008, the Baltimore Ravens drafted Joe Flacco with the 18th overall pick in the draft, with the idea that he would ultimately emerge as a franchise quarterback. As a rookie, Flacco completed 60% of his passes for 2,971 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, and the Ravens posted an 11-5 regular season record, before losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. From there, critics immediately began to rip Joe Flacco as a “game manager,” that rode upon the coattails of an elite defense to win regular season games.

Flacco emphatically shed that reputation in 2012-2013, as he put the Ravens offense on his back, completing 58% of his passes for 1,140 yards, 11 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, and a 117 quarterback rating. In Super Bowl XLVIII, Flacco took home MVP honors <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201302030sfo.htm" target="_blank">after torching the San Francisco 49ers</a> for 287 passing yards and 3 touchdowns.

Joe Flacco, at 6-foot-6, throws one of the more beautiful deep balls in the NFL. Flacco is especially adept at setting up the play action pass, taking a deep drop, and airing out the football for big yardage. In the 2013 Divisional Playoff, Joe Flacco hooked up with Jacoby Jones, on a 70-yard touchdown bomb in Denver, with 17 seconds left on the regulation clock. When the smoke finally cleared, the Ravens left Mile High with a win in overtime, en route to the Super Bowl.

<h2>5. Jamal Lewis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_771834" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-771834 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lewis-Sean-Brady-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Sean Brady/Getty Images[/caption]

Also known as the entirety of the Baltimore offense between 2000 and 2006, Jamal Lewis would watch as opposing defenses would stack 8 men in the box, and dare the Ravens to throw the football (the Ravens had Trent Dilfer at quarterback). Still, Lewis somehow rumbled for 1,364 yards and 6 touchdowns, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LewiJa00.htm" target="_blank">as a 21-year old rookie</a>. From there, Jamal Lewis went on to pace the Ravens with 338 rushing yards and 4 touchdowns, through four physical games of postseason play. This run included 102 yards and 1 touchdown, in Super Bowl XXXV.

In all, Jamal Lewis ran for 7,80 yards and 45 touchdowns over the course of six years as a Raven. Certainly, defenders knew that Jamal Lewis was coming, but could do noting to stop him, as the engine behind the smash mouth attack in Baltimore.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[General Managers may have the toughest jobs in the National Football League, but the best General Managers in the NFL make it look easy.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[General Managers may have the toughest gig in the NFL. Outside of having to make countless heavily-scrutinized player personnel and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-of-the-biggest-nfl-draft-busts.html/">NFL Draft-related evaluations</a>, they also must make difficult decisions that will ultimately affect the livelihoods of their staff and players on a daily basis. They have to manage a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/">hard salary cap</a>, and they have to deal with some of the biggest egos in pro sports. And they do all of this with little to no job security to fall back on.

No one knows exactly how the 2017 NFL season will ultimately pan out. So we decided to rank the top seven GMs in the business. While pulling off splashy trades and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-steals-in-nfl-draft-history.html/">making calculated picks</a> on draft day may be the most glorified aspect of the GM position, a lot more actually goes into being a top-notch General Manager.

With these rankings, we considered several factors such as draft picks, free-agent signings, salary cap management, coaching hires, and team culture. Here is a look at the top seven General Managers in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a>.
<h2>7. Reggie McKenzie, Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_815565" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-815565" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Reggie-McKenzieJustin-SullivanGetty-Images-1024x679.jpg" alt="Raiders General Manager Reggie McKenzie looks on during a press conference." width="757" height="502" /> Reggie McKenzie has done an outstanding job building the Oakland Raiders. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images[/caption]

There is simply no way we can ignore the job that Reggie McKenzie has done to build the Raiders. When he took the job in Oakland back in 2012, he inherited a roster in shambles and a team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-worst-nfl-head-coaches-ever.html/?a=viewall">with zero identity or culture</a>. To top it all off, he had to fix their disastrous salary cap situation.

In five years, McKenzie has taken the Raiders from laughingstock to one of the best teams in the AFC. Along the way he made several outstanding draft picks (most notably Khalil Mack and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-tom-brady.html/?a=viewall">Derek Carr</a>), and he has structured contracts in a way that gives the team the flexibility to be aggressive during free agency. Thanks to McKenzie, the Raiders have one of the best young core groups of players in the league. They should be competitive for the next decade.

<h2>6. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710515" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710515" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jerry-Jones_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is seen on the field prior to a game." width="757" height="505" /> Jerry Jones is an outstanding businessman. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

We've <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/heres-how-the-dallas-cowboys-will-crush-your-dreams.html/">been hard on Jerry Jones</a> in the past, but we have to give respect when respect is due here. After years of aggressively spending money during free agency -- and usually striking out -- Jones finally shifted gears. Now, the Cowboys are focusing on building their roster through the NFL Draft. Jones' son, Stephen, does deserve some of the credit for finally <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-hated-owners-in-sports-history.html/">getting through to his dad</a> in regards to his roster-building philosophy. However, at the end of the day, the Cowboys are still Jerry's team.

On top of having built the Cowboys into a legitimate Super Bowl contender, Jones is also one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/richest-nfl-team-owners-2016.html/">best pure businessmen</a> in the league.

<h2>5. Ted Thompson, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ted-Thompson_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Green Bay Packers General Manager Ted Thompson celebrates after the Packers won Super Bowl XLV. " width="758" height="505" /> Green Bay Packers General Manager Ted Thompson celebrates after the Packers won Super Bowl XLV. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Regardless of how the rest of his tenure as the GM <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cities-that-have-the-biggest-nfl-fans.html/">in Green Bay</a> plays out, Ted Thompson will always be remembered as the guy who not only drafted quarterback Aaron Rodgers, but who also knew when the time was right <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-backup-nfl-quarterbacks.html/">to turn to Rodgers</a> and move on from Hall of Fame signal-caller Brett Favre.

Outside of that, Thompson put together the roster that won Super Bowl XLV; he and his staff do an excellent job of managing the Packers’ salary cap situation; he hired head coach Mike McCarthy, who has won 114 regular-season games, six NFC North championships, and one Super Bowl; and despite a <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/02/25/ted-thompson-were-not-opposed-to-free-agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bit of criticism</a>, he proves to be one of the best in the business when it comes to avoiding signing overpriced free-agent talent. Don’t be surprised if the Packers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-52.html/">win another Super Bowl title</a> while Thompson still calls the shots.

<h2>4. Ozzie Newsome, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ozzie-Newsome_Patrick-McDermott_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Baltimore Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome walks on the sideline during a team practice. " width="757" height="752" /> Baltimore Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome walks on the sideline during a team practice. | Patrick McDermott/Getty Images[/caption]

We could argue that Ozzie Newsome -- already a Pro Football Hall of Fame player -- is the best NFL GM. He's run the Ravens personnel department since they moved <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/forget-seattle-and-the-12th-man-here-are-the-nfls-5-best-fanbases.html/">to Baltimore</a> in 1996 (even if he wasn't officially promoted to General Manager until 2002, when he became the first African American General Manager in league history<span class="s1">).</span>
<p class="p1">During his reign in Baltimore, Newsome has built two <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-wild-card-teams-that-won-the-super-bowl.html/">Super Bowl-winning rosters</a>; he's drafted 17 players and signed three undrafted free agents who became Pro Bowlers; and he has hired two incredibly successful head coaches in Brian Billick and John Harbaugh.</p>
He built a system of scouting players and managing the salary cap with a focus on immense, sustainable success. Last but not least, according to <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000651408/article/ozzie-newsome-ravens-recent-drafts-not-up-to-par?campaign=tw-nf-sf24058615-sf24058615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assistant General Manager Eric DeCosta</a>, no team in the league has had more money spent on their players over the last seven years than the Ravens -- something that speaks volumes about how highly the rest of the league values Baltimore's players.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. John Schneider, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jimmy-Graham_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jimmy Graham runs across the field." width="757" height="752" /> John Schneider works with Jimmy Graham (pictured above) and the rest of the Seahawks franchise. | Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

Since taking over as the team’s General Manager in 2010, Schneider has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-a-pro-sports-team-rebuild-actually-worked.html/">built the Seahawks</a> into a bona fide NFL juggernaut. How did he do it? He's established himself as the best GM in the business when it comes finding middle- and late-round draft steals and starting-caliber <a href="http://www.seahawks.com/news/2015/05/07/seahawks-undrafted-rookie-free-agent-success-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">undrafted free agents</a>.

Schneider is responsible for drafting guys such as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-tom-brady.html/">quarterback Russell Wilson</a> (third round), cornerback Richard Sherman (fifth round), safety Kam Chancellor (fifth round), wide receiver Tyler Lockett (third round), cornerback Byron Maxwell (sixth round), and linebacker Malcolm Smith (seventh round). He manages to find players who slipped through the cracks. (Schneider signed undrafted free agents like running back Thomas Rawls, wide receivers Doug Baldwin, Jermaine Kearse, and Ricardo Lockette, and offensive lineman Garry Gilliam.)

He also proves to be outstanding when it comes to handling the team’s salary cap. All said, with the roster foundation that Schneider has set, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-stadiums.html/">Seattle</a> will contend for a Super Bowl for several years to come.

<h2>2. John Elway, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/John-Elway_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Denver Broncos General Manager John Elway looks on after their win over the Carolina Panthers during Super Bowl 50." width="758" height="528" /> Denver Broncos General Manager John Elway celebrates after winning Super Bowl 50. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Elway is easily one of the top five quarterbacks in NFL history. Since his retirement <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-7-super-bowl-winning-teams-of-all-time.html/">as a player</a>, he's developed into one of the league’s best personnel executives, too. Since taking over control of the Broncos’ football operations in 2011, Elway’s teams have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">won five AFC West titles</a>, two AFC titles, and one Super Bowl. In 2015, he built what many argue to be the best defense the league has ever seen.

Elway has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">made a name for himself</a> as arguably the best free-agent recruiter in recent NFL history by attracting and signing players such as quarterback Peyton Manning, who many would argue was the single greatest free-agent signing in league history; cornerback Aqib Talib; outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware; safety T.J. Ward; wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders; offensive guard Louis Vasquez; linebacker Brandon Marshall; and offensive tackle Russell Okung.

As if that weren’t enough, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-wealthiest-nfl-players-of-all-time.html/">has struck gold</a> at basically every point <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2017-nfl-draft-potential-targets-for-the-denver-broncos.html/">in the NFL Draft</a> (including signing undrafted free agents) with picks such as outside linebacker Von Miller (first round), tight ends Julius Thomas (fourth round) and Virgil Green (seventh round), defensive ends Derek Wolfe (second round) and Malik Jackson (fifth round), linebacker Danny Trevathan (sixth round), cornerback Bradley Roby (first round), outside linebacker Shane Ray (first round), and undrafted free-agent signings like cornerback Chris Harris Jr., outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett, and running back C.J. Anderson.

Elway and the Broncos have experienced quite a bit of roster turnover this offseason. However, they will continue to be one of the AFC’s premier franchises with "the Duke" at the helm. If you doubt that, consider the draft day trade that brought Paxton Lynch, hopefully the Mile High City's quarterback of the future, to Denver.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Bill Belichick, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_585324" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-585324" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bill-Belichick-Elsa-Getty-Images-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots scrutinizes his team's choices during a game. " width="757" height="505" /> Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots scrutinizes his team's choices during a game. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Whether you love him or <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/most-hated-coaches.html/">hate him</a>, there is no denying that Belichick is one of the greatest head coaches and General Managers the NFL has ever seen. He has an unmatched ability to know when to cut ties with a player, which has led some people believe that he can be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-bill-belichick-sent-packing.html/">overly ruthless</a>.

However, we have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/times-bill-belichick-owned-press.html/">nothing but respect</a> for the five-time Super Bowl champion head coach’s refusal to allow any player (other than Tom Brady) to be bigger than his team. We can justify his greatness as a personnel executive: The Patriots are never in salary cap trouble. They rarely have a "bad" contract on their books, and they constantly find late-round and undrafted free agent steals. On top of that, New England regularly gets the best of their competition in draft day trades.

This kind of goes without saying, but as long as Belichick runs the show in New England, the Patriots will likely be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-head-coaches-in-nfl-history.html/">legitimate Super Bowl contenders</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_662298" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-662298" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mike-Mularkey-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Titans coach Mike Mularkey watches the action. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images" width="757" height="514" /> Titans coach Mike Mularkey watches the action. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Being a head coach in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Football League</a> comes with little job security. In fact, you can easily count on one hand the number of coaches around the league that are currently "untouchable." Nonetheless, NFL coaching jobs always have, and always will, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-coaching-jobs-will-always-trump-college-football-coaching-jobs.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reign supreme</a> in the opinions of those who are crazy enough to choose a career in the world's ultimate "what have you done for me lately" industry.

We regularly see NFL head coaches get fired after only one or two years on the job. It can be for minuscule reasons, something completely out of their control, or because they were flat-out bad at their job.

In this article, we look at the coaches whose performances simply were not up to par. With that being said, here are the 10 worst head coaches in the history of the NFL, as determined by their lifetime coaching percentages -- i.e. their wins ranked against their losses.
<h2>10. Mike Mularkey</h2>
After replacing Ken Whisenhunt on an interim basis following Week 8 of the 2015 season, Mike Mularkey (pictured above) is getting the chance to prove he has the goods to be a legitimate NFL head coach, as the Tennessee Titans <a href="http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-4/Mike-Mularkey-Honored-to-be-Named-Head-Coach/dca3a436-da70-4ec9-ba6c-6e614521c7ab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the position permanent</a> during the offseason. Give Mularkey's previous rack record in the role, we hope the organization knows what it's doing.

Including his nine games at the helm of the Titans this past season, Mularkey has been a head coach on three separate occasions, two years (2004–05) with the Buffalo Bills and one season (2012) with the Jacksonville Jaguars, compiling an overall record of 18-39. Not exactly a mark that should instill confidence in his ability to call the shots. Like we said, we hope the Titans know what they're doing.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Bill McPeak</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Washington-Redskins-Helmet_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x472.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="558" /> Washington Redskins helmet. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

As a defensive end for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill McPeak found plenty of success. He earned a trip to the Pro Bowl on three separate occasions (1952–53, 1956). However, a head football coach for the Washington Redskins, he did not experienced much success.

During McPeak's five seasons -- 1961–65 -- on the Washington sidelines, the Redskins never once finished with a .500 record. Instead, the team went <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/McPeBi0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21-46-3</a> during his brief tenure. While McPeak would never get another head-coaching gig, he did become the offensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins in 1973. So, at least there's that.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Darryl Rogers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577348" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577348" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Detroit-Lions-fan-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images-640x424.jpg" alt="Detroit-Lions-fan-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="502" /> Detroit Lions fan. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1985, Darryl Rogers received the opportunity to coach the team that the above gentleman has probably loved for as long as he can remember. His time at the helm did not go well -- for anyone.

In less than four full seasons with the Detroit Lions, Rogers <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/RogeDa0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">won just 18 games</a> while losing 40 in the same amount of time. It's no wonder that the organization replaced him 11 games into the 1988 season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Harland Svare</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705176" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705176 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Los-Angeles-Rams-Hulton-Archive-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="7 Worst NFL Head Coaches Ever" width="757" height="575" /> Harland Svare | Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

Harland Svare, a linebacker turned head coach, spent eight years as a pro with the LA Rams and, later, with the New York Giants. He then coached the Rams (1962-65) and the San Diego Chargers (1971-73), finishing his coaching career with a lifetime record of 21 wins to 48 losses.

Savare voluntarily left his position in 1973, perhaps because he realized he wasn’t very good at it. That’s not him in the picture, by the way, it’s his teammate, Bob Waterfield. However, it is one of the only surviving pictures of the Los Angeles Rams in the early '50s (that photo was taken in 1952), and Svare made his debut with the team a year later.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Joe Bugel</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705185" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705185 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Joe-Bugel-Todd-Warshaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="7 Worst NFL Head Coaches Ever" width="757" height="497" /> Joe Bugel gives instructions. | Todd Warshaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Over five years as a head coach -- four consecutively with the Phoenix Cardinals (now just "Arizona") and a redemption season/second chance with the Oakland Raiders in 1997 -- Joe Bugel was able to compile a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/BugeJo0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24-56 record over 80 games</a>. That, needless to say, is not a great mark if you want to keep coaching in the NFL.

Bugel's stint with the Raiders involved a 4-12 season record. He never found another head coaching job in the league again, despite his prolific college coaching resume and extended stints on the coaching staffs of the Chargers and the Washington Redskins.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Marion Campbell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577529" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Philadelphia-Eagles-Helmet_Brian-Cleary_Getty-Images-640x441.jpg" alt="Brian Cleary/Getty Images" width="757" height="521" /> Philadelphia Eagles helmet. | Brian Cleary/Getty Images[/caption]

The only coach on this list to successfully oversee a professional NFL team for over 100 games, Marion Campbell was decidedly unspectacular as a head coach, finishing his career with an overall record of 34-80-1. While his defensive acumen was unparalleled -- browsing through <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/CampMa0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his <em>PFR</em> page</a> reveals an extraordinary amount of success as a defensive coordinator -- anything beyond that seemed to be a tall order for the two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman.

<h2>4. Dave McGinnis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705203" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705203 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dave-McGinnis-Otto-Gruele-Jr.-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="7 Worst NFL Head Coaches Ever" width="757" height="564" /> Dave McGinnis is not a happy camper. | Otto Gruele Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

There are certain teams that everyone remembers for better or worse. The 1972 Miami Dolphins and (almost) the 2007 New England Patriots. The Buffalo Bills of the '90s made it to four consecutive Super Bowls and lost every single one. These teams are etched in the collective being of the NFL; groups that can be safely referenced in fan conversation with the knowledge that most people will know what you’re talking about.

The Arizona Cardinals of the early 2000s are not one of those teams, and that’s because they went <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/McGiDa0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17-40 from 2000 until 2003</a> under the stewardship of Dave McGinnis. He hasn't had a head coaching job since.

<h2>3. Jimmy Phelan</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ysVix65xdg"></iframe>
In 1951, the last year of the New York Yanks' (not Yankees) existence, they went 1-9 under the direction of Jimmy Phelan, a head coach who spent two earlier seasons with the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC, going 7-7 in his first season and 4-8 the second. Phelan’s last head coaching gig would be with the Dallas Texans of 1952. They went 1-11, giving Jimmy a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/PhelJi0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifetime record of 13-35</a>.

As the worst head coach of the modern era, Shula spent five years leading the Cincinnati Bengals. His time with the team eventually cultivated a disastrous <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/ShulDa0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">19-52 record</a>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that was the last time Shula received a head coaching gig. Don Shula’s son quickly bailed on football to move on to something he was more comfortable with, namely Shula’s Steak Houses.

<h2>1. Bert Bell</h2>

The football of the late '30s and early '40s is not nearly as recognizable as the game that millions sit down to watch every weekend and Monday night. If you don’t believe us, take a look at this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzZVSizf2OI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to play football film</a>” from the era. One of the things that translates strongly from the past to the present, though, is the winning and the losing.

Bert Bell, who was the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1936 until 1941, was much more familiar with losing, winning only 10 games out of the 58 that he coached. That is not very good.

		<description><![CDATA[The are some NFL franchises with helmets that have gotten a bit outdated. What would it look like if they decided to freshen up their style?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_577527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Washington-Redskins-Helmet_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x472.jpg" alt="Washington Redskins helmet | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="558" /> Washington Redskins helmet | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

There are some logos in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> that are absolutely timeless. They are effortlessly pure and perfectly executed. It’s tough to pull off this kind of look, but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/8-pieces-of-nfl-gear-you-can-wear-to-the-office.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">you know it when you see it</a>. And then there are organizations that seriously need to upgrade their style — specifically, their helmets.

Fortunately for these teams, the talented <a href="http://deeyung.com/" target="_blank">Dylan Young</a> managed to create some pretty fresh redesigns. Suffice it to say that these aren’t real NFL helmets, but there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be. Here’s a look at 10 helmets that could do wonders for a team’s image.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 1. New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760935" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760935" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Orleans-Saints_bold-helmet-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

Don’t get us wrong: There is something beautiful about the simplicity in the <a href="http://www.canalstreetchronicles.com/2013/6/11/4415118/new-orleans-saints-logo-louisiana" target="_blank">original fleur-de-lis logo</a> that currently sits atop the New Orleans Saints' helmets. But New Orleans is a city that deserves a little flash; it needs a bit of pop. This new helmet does all that. The shiny black helmet really stands out, and the gold face mask is super fresh. Plus, that big logo truly fits with the jazzy personality associated with the city of New Orleans. We could absolutely see Drew Brees strapping this bad boy on.

<h2>2. Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760933" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760933" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Atlanta-Falcons_bold-helmet-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

This white Atlanta Falcons helmet is super sleek. Immediately, everything looks sharper and more polished. Sure, the Falcons logo is bigger on this new design, but it stands out against the new backdrop. Our favorite part about this new look would have to be how well the grey outline surrounding the fierce bird stands out. It’s all about the details, and this one makes a big difference to the overall aesthetic of the helmet.

<h2>3. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760939" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760939" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eagles_bold-helmet-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

The <a href="http://blog.heritagesportsart.com/2010/08/philadelphia-eagles-uniform-and-team.html" target="_blank">helmet history</a> of the Philadelphia Eagles has always focused on the the green color changes and evolving wings. The massive eagle logo sitting on top of the matte white finish is super smooth. The green face mask is a perfect complement to the rest of the helmet. Fly, Eagles fly!

&nbsp;

<h2>4. Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760937" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760937" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Buffalo-Bills_bold-helmet-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

When the Bills <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-4-things-to-make-of-rex-ryan-in-buffalo.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">hired Rex Ryan to be their head coach</a> back in 2015 they were clearly looking to establish a new identity up in Buffalo. The way we see it, a good way to keep that momentum going would be to make these helmets part of their everyday uniforms. Normally we’re opposed to the usage of bright red because it comes across as too much, but this new look is just uber bold. It’s a statement piece. It goes perfectly with the new textured blue bison. That beast is really charging now.

<h2>5. Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760936" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760936" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Pittsburgh-Steelers_bold-helmets-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

The Pittsburgh Steelers are a blue-collar organization that pride themselves on hard work and physical toughness. After all, their logo is an <a href="http://www.steelers.com/history/logo-history.html" target="_blank">ode to the steel industry</a>. This new look only enhances that connection. No longer are the three hypocycloids encompassed within a circle. They are large and they are beautifully marked, with a texture that appears to take on the look of metal flooring. This appearance extends all the way to the yellow face mask. This helmet is a true embodiment of steely toughness.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740457" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740457" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Minnesota-Vikings-Fresh-Football-Helmets-Dylan-Young-e1482156608992.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

Making yellow the primary color of Minnesota's helmet might throw some for a loop, but the more we look at this concept, the more we like it. It's different, but it's also bold. The matte finish is gorgeous, and the white and purple horn really pops off this lid. The use of a purple facemask is an excellent final touch. In these helmets, the Vikings would only be stepping up their (style) game.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740456" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740456" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Indianapolis-Colts-Fresh-Football-Helmets-Dylan-Young-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

There's nothing wrong with the current Indianapolis Colts helmet. In fact, if you're of the "less is more" frame of mind, then Indy's white helmet with a blue horseshoe and center stripe is pretty much perfect. Still, there's nothing wrong with taking an adventurous turn every once in a way. This is one of those times. We dig the blue helmet and absolutely love the chrome horseshoe. This might not be an everyday lid, but for special occasions, it wouldn't hurt the Colts to take a walk on the wild side.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740450" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740450" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Houston-Texans-Fresh-Football-Helmets-Dylan-Young.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

&nbsp;

We don't usually promote helmets with massive logos. However, in this particular case, we feel comfortable making an exception. The Texans have had the same midnight blue helmets since the organization joined the league back in 2002. With this change, the red, grey, and blue, steer logo is not just an afterthought; it officially jumps off the white lid and screams "everything is bigger in Texas." What more could you want?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740453" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740453" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/New-York-Jets-Fresh-Football-Helmets-Dylan-Young-500x500.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

If the New York Jets aren't going to be competitive on the field, then they might as well at least <em>look</em> the part. This helmet pays tribute to the franchise's past while also remaining hip and current. The use of the "cloud texture" is perfect, giving the impression that the team is finally read to take off and fly. If we were Jets fans, not only is this the feeling we <em>want</em>, it's the feeling we'd <em>need</em>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740444" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740444" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Miami-Dolphins-Fresh-Football-Helmets-Dyan-Young-e1482154758137.jpg" alt="Source: Dylan Young" width="757" height="757" /> Source: Dylan Young[/caption]

As with the Jets, this Miami Dolphins helmet thrives because of the texture. Young makes "water" a prominent part of the design, thus adding an extra dimension to the lid. With the look, Miami is all about sun, fun, dolphins, and the coolness of H2O. It doesn't get more "fresh" than that.

		<description><![CDATA[NFL athletes make money. They work hard and they get paid. Here are the wealthiest NFL players; the ones who built on their athletic acumen the most.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Across the board, NFL players get the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/underpaid-nfl-players-who-deserve-a-massive-pay-raise.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">short end of the stick</a> when it comes to being paid for their unreal athletic ability and performances. Their contracts are largely unguaranteed, their career windows are short -- probably because playing in a football game, even at levels below the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Football League</a>, is comparable <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/football-similar-to-car-crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to a car accident</a> -- and their endorsement opportunities are generally slim.

In fact, aside from the handful of guys who reporters corral after the game and those who are just flat-out massive human beings, most NFL players can take off their pads, helmet, and jersey and slip out into the night without anyone noticing.

But some of them are able to bankroll their fame and (relative) fortune into more fortune, and sometimes even more fame. From licensing deals to owning franchises to eventually owning an NFL team, à la the late Al Davis, the money’s out there if the player is savvy enough to seek it. Here are 19 of the wealthiest NFL players, both past and present -- the guys who have been able to take their athletic acumen and turn it into continued financial success.
<h2>17. (tie) Joe Flacco</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660652" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660652" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Flacco_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-593x500.jpg" alt="Joe Flacco gives the thumbs up." width="757" height="639" /> Joe Flacco makes elite money. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $55 million

Is Joe Flacco an elite quarterback? That question is still up for debate. Is he worth a lot of money? That question, on the other hand, is not. Over the course of his career, the Super Bowl winner has pulled in <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/baltimore-ravens/joe-flacco-4000/cash-earnings/">almost $115 million in total cash earnings</a> and is reportedly worth $55 million. Yeah, if we were him, we'd be giving the thumbs up, too.

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">17. (tie) Jerry Rice </span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_542964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-542964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jerry-Rice-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images-e1434719507736-640x442.jpg" alt="Jerry-Rice-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images-e1434719507736.jpg" width="757" height="523" /> Jerry Rice is so cool. | Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $55 million</p>
<p class="p1">When you're arguably the greatest player in the history of the NFL, you can expect to be worth a boatload of money. That's just the way it is. Jerry Rice's coin comes from a few different sources, but we choose to look at him as the guy who stands as the league's all-time leader in receiving yards (22,895), receptions (1,549), and receiving touchdowns (197).</p>
<!--nextpage-->
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">17. (tie) Drew Brees </span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_541614" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-541614 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Drew-Brees_Wesley-Hitt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Wesley Hitt/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Drew Brees takes the field. | Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $55 million</p>
Despite being 38 years old, Drew Brees continues to sling the football like a guy half his age. And while the future Hall of Famer, and current New Orleans Saints quarterback, has made quite the living using that right arm of his, we know he'll continue to bring in the big bucks when his playing days are over -- the proof is in the commercials; so long as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfy8UYRhmpA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he doesn't sing</a>, that is.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>14. (tie) Sam Bradford</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713173" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713173" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sam-Bradford-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x386.jpg" alt="Sam Bradford throws a pass." width="757" height="457" /> Sam Bradford played good football for the Vikes. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $60 million

Sam Bradford is proof that you don't need to be successful on the field to make a boatload of money off it. The 29-year-old quarterback, who's best known for his extensive injury history, has never led his team to the playoffs, yet has managed to earn nearly $100 million over the course of his career. If you think this sounds unfair, trust us, you're not alone.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>14. (tie) Fran Tarkenton</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-jmCovYwkkU"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $60 million

Considered by many to be the original "scrambling quarterback," Fran Tarkenton was all about doing what he had to do to make the team better. In 18 seasons, The Scrambler made nine Pro Bowls, earned one All-Pro honor, was named the MVP in 1975, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986. Thanks to his success as a TV personality and software executive, Tarkenton is worth an impressive $60 million.

<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">14. (tie) Carson Palmer</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_567590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-567590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Carson-Palmer_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-640x438.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="518" /> Carson Palmer looks to throw. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $60 million

If you're surprised to see Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer so high on the list, you're not alone. We know he's a quality passer, but we had no idea that his net worth was $60 million. Then again, if you take into consideration that he's pulled in <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/arizona-cardinals/carson-palmer-1372/cash-earnings/">$156,648,722 in career earnings</a>, maybe it's not so crazy after all.

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">13. Michael Strahan</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_542965" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-542965 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Michael-Strahan-Kevork-Djansezian-Getty-Images-e1434719690932.jpg" alt="Michael Strahan is an entertainer." width="757" height="508" /> Michael Strahan looks sharp. | Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]
<p class="p1"> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $65 million</p>
We don't care that former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan is 45 years old; we honestly believe he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-retired-players-who-could-still-play-today.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could put on the pads and suit up today</a>. The man is in that good of shape. Of course, when you think about his success off the field, you can't help but ask yourself one simple question: Why would he even want to?

Strahan crushes it on <em>Fox NFL Sunday and</em> <em>Good Morning America</em>, and he's always showing up as a presenter of sorts. We've seen the smile of a man worth $65 million -- and it comes with a a gap in the teeth.

<h2>11. (tie) Tony Romo</h2>
[caption id="attachment_784343" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-784343" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Tony-Romo-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tony Romo #9 of the Dallas Cowboys celebrates throwing the game-winning touchdown pass." width="757" height="503" /> Tony Romo had a nice run. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $70 million

Tony Romo may no longer be the starting quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, but the four-time Pro Bowler certainly didn't walk away from the game empty handed. Over the course of his career, the 37-year-old gunslinger took home <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys/tony-romo-2447/cash-earnings/">$127,422,458 in total cash earnings</a> and now finds himself worth a cool $70 million. If Romo succeeds in his new position as an NFL broadcast analyst for CBS, he'll surely have ample opportunities to pad his bank account ever further.

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">11. (tie) Ben Roethlisberger </span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_658661" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658661" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ben-Roethlisberger_Jared-Wickerham_Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="Jared Wickerham/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Ben Roethlisberger watches the action from the sidelines. | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $70 million</p>
<p class="p1">As another one of the NFL's top quarterbacks, Ben Roethlisberger has put together quite a career for himself, winning two Super Bowls and earning four trips to the Pro Bowl. For his fine work with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he has been paid quite handsomely, pulling in $158,286,864 in career earnings and compiling a net worth of $70 million. Just another reason why they call him  "Big Ben."</p>
<p class="p1"><!--nextpage--></p>

<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">10. Joe Montana </span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_554889" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-554889" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Joe-Montana-George-Rose-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Joe Montana (L) walks onto the field." width="757" height="505" /> Joe Montana is "Joe Cool." | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $80 million

As the coolest man in the Bay Area, Joe Montana was always at his best when the lights were the brightest. Four trips to the Super Bowl, four world championships, and a quarterbacking legacy that's nearly impossible to rival. And yet, despite being worth $80 million dollars, Montana still insists on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh9YGZs8zP0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting his pizza for free</a>. Classic stuff, Joe.

You can make fun of Eli Manning's face all you want, it doesn't matter, it still helps pay the bills. As a two-time Super Bowl champion and starting quarterback of the New York Giants, Peyton's little brother has made quite a name for himself on the field -- with <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-york-giants/eli-manning/cash-earnings/">$205,780,004<strong> </strong>in total earnings</a> -- and off, with endorsement deals (worth a total of $8-10 million a year) with brands like Toyota, DirecTV, Kraft, Reebok, Citizen, and Samsung. Who's laughing now?

<h2>8. (tie) Brett Favre<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brett-Favre_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Quarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers during the first round playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin on January 9, 2004.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $100 Millon

"Hi, I’m Brett Favre, former NFL Quarterback. You’ve probably seen me in advertisements endorsing Wrangler Jeans, Nike everything, and Sears, to name most of the things I endorse. Perhaps you may have seen me with the Green Bay Packers, or perhaps you saw my numerous flirtations with retirement before finally signing off from the game in 2011."

Favre, the first player in the NFL to sign a $100 million dollar contract -- rather, it was a “lifetime” contract extension signed with the Green Bay Packers in 2001 -- was the only player to win the NFL regular season MVP award three times in a row. At the time of his retirement, he held league records for passing touchdowns, passing yards, attempts, interceptions, and all time wins. (However, Peyton Manning has since passed him in passing touchdowns and passing yards, and tied him in all time wins.)

Following his 16 seasons in Green Bay, Favre ultimately went on to play for the New York Jets and the Minnesota Vikings, and almost the St. Louis Rams, according to both parties, in 2013. At least Favre seems at ease with his retirement now, and can even joke about it when his still-sponsor Nike needs to film a new commercial.

<h2>7. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_559073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-559073" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/John-Elway_Elsa_Getty-Images1-640x427.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> John Elways enjoying the moment. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $145 million

John Elway -- former quarterback (there’s a trend here) for the Denver Broncos and current General Manager for the same franchise -- has diversified himself well beyond his Hall of Fame career as a football player. Elway, who led his teams to five Super Bowls appearances and two Super Bowl titles over the course of his 15 years as the Broncos' starting quarterback, has diversified his business well beyond the sport that has opened so many doors for him.

Currently, Elway is the owner of a quartet of restaurants -- steakhouses named, Elway’s -- and a handful of car dealerships (he actually sold his original group of auto dealerships in 1997 for $82.5 million). Elway also owned an Arena Football League team, the Colorado Crush, back when arena football was still a thing (the team folded in 2008).

One could easily make a case for Elway being both the best quarterback to ever play the game and the best executive in the history of the game. And he would likely rank even higher on this list had he not <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_16333804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fallen victim to a Ponzi scheme</a> a few years back.

<h2><strong>6. Tom Brady</strong></h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $180 million

There used to be a massive poster of New England Patriots quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tom-brady/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady</a> modeling UGG boots on Brookline Ave. near Kenmore Square, overlooking Fenway Park and I-90. It was probably 200 feet tall and featured Brady standing contrapposto<em> </em>inside a pair of rather unattractive boots. And Brady probably got paid very well for that ad campaign, one of his many dalliances with sponsorships and extracurricular fiscal opportunities that make up his career.

The quarterback, who has won five Super Bowls with the Patriots, his career-long team, also has endorsement arrangements with Under Armour, and has previously been engaged with SmartWater, Visa, and Movado. His performance on the gridiron has led him to a pretty lucrative income from the NFL, too.

Over the course of his 17-year NFL career, Brady's contracts have grossed the four-time Super Bowl MVP $196,166,804 in cash earnings before agent fees and taxes. That number will rise substantially over the next few years, as Brady isn't planning on hanging up his cleats any time soon. What's even crazier is the fact that Brady is out-earned by his wife, supermodel Gisele Bündchen.

<h2>3. (tie) Steve Young</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $200 million

We knew Steve Young was an all-time great quarterback, but we had no idea he was worth so much coin. The man who went from being Montana's backup to a Hall of Fame QB with seven Pro Bowl appearances, two MVP awards, three All-Pro selections, and three Super Bowl rings, used his investing chops to become a serious player in the world of private equity. Should you ever feel the need to lash out -- in jealousy -- at Young over his success, you can catch him on ESPN, where he also makes bank as an NFL analyst.

<h2>3. (tie) Peyton Manning<strong>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $200 million

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/peyton-manning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peyton Manning</a>, apparently, loves being in advertisements. He’ll sell you Papa John’s. He will sell you Buicks. He’ll sell you Gatorade and he will even sell you DirectTV. After making over $90 million with the Indianapolis Colts, Manning took a year off to rehab himself from a serious neck surgery. Then, the club waived him.

So, he promptly signed a five-year deal for an additional $96M with the Denver Broncos, and he’s the best regular-season quarterback in the history of the NFL, so it’s not a bad investment. In total, Manning earned $248,732,000 in cash earnings (excluding all endorsement earnings) as an NFL player before agent fees and taxes.

But back to his endorsements for a quick second. Based on the sheer number of classic commercials he appears in, Manning has to be considered the best endorser in NFL history. Here's a look at a few of our favorites:

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $200 million

Did you know John Madden was an NFL coach? It’s true! Did you know John Madden was an NFL commentator? Also true! Did you know that somewhere there are vast swaths of football fans who don’t think of either of those things when you say the word "Madden"? To legions of fans that were too young to see Madden do, well, anything in the world of real football, his surname evokes hours upon hours of digital football.

Madden signed on to endorse <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/hub/everything-you-need-to-know-clint-oldenburg-talks-madden-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electronic Arts’ NFL video game</a> all the way back in 1988. It was <em>John Madden Football</em>. The series became <em>Madden NFL</em> in 1994. Feel old yet? Back then, there was no way the sportscaster could’ve foreseen the behemoth that the franchise would become.

The latest iteration, <em>Madden NFL 25</em>, had down sales <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/09/05/madden-nfl-25-down-over-last-year-still-top-1m-units-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compared to </a><em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/09/05/madden-nfl-25-down-over-last-year-still-top-1m-units-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madden ’13</a> </em>and still sold 1 million copies in its first week. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As of 2010</a>, the franchise had sold over 99 million copies, according to <em>ESPN</em>. It is a cash cow. Check out how Madden’s most famous contribution to the NFL has changed throughout the years:

<h2>2. Roger Staubach<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roger-Staubach_Todd-Warshaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Former NFL great Roger Staubach." width="758" height="505" /> Roger Staubach addresses the media. | Todd Warshaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $600 million

What is a Roger Staubach, and why is it worth so much money? A Roger Staubach is a former NFL quarterback (to the shock of absolutely no one) who was good at football, leading the Cowboys to a pair of Super Bowl victories, winning an MVP, and being a six-time Pro Bowler.

Staubach worked as a real estate broker during the offseasons, because “I was 27 and we had three children,” the mogul <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/02/27/roger-staubach-from-cowboys-qb-to-real-estate-mogul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told </a><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/02/27/roger-staubach-from-cowboys-qb-to-real-estate-mogul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. “If I got hurt, I knew I had a family to provide for, and it was not crazy money in the NFL then.” Shortly after his 1979 retirement, Staubach began expanding his real estate company. It grew so large and so successful that Staubach was able to sell the company to Jones Lang Lasalle in 2008 for $640 million dollars.

According to Forbes, Staubach had only owned 12% of the company when he sold it, having given out equity to his employees as the company grew. So, in addition to being the richest NFL athlete ever, he’s also a pretty nice dude.

<h2>1. Jerry Richardson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_624665" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-624665" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jerry-Richardson_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson watches the action. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Net worth</span>: $1.1 billion

That's right, billion with a "B." Jerry Richardson, the owner of the Carolina Panthers, was a Carolina native who played for the Colts (the Baltimore Colts, mind you) in the early days of the NFL, hooking up with <a href="http://www.panthers.com/team/staff/jerry-richardson/4bcc4b2e-0a78-468a-a00c-bdc925d797a9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no other than legendary quarterback Johnny Unitas</a> for a touchdown in the 1959 NFL championship game.

As you may have guessed by his place on the list and the time in which he played, endorsements didn't help Richardson earn his money; he got rich in the fast food industry, franchising his first Hardee's in 1961 and <a href="http://www.knowitall.org/legacy/laureates/Jerry%20Richardson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expanding from there</a>.

While Richardson has a mixed reputation among NFL fans -- he allegedly <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/14/more-details-emerge-on-jerry-richardsons-interaction-with-peyton-manning-drew-brees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out Peyton Manning and Drew Brees</a> during the NFL lockout, for example -- he's made at least one Panthers fan's day, when he responded to a 12-year-old's inquiry to fandom <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24956552/-year-old-writes-letter-to-all-32-nfl-teams-only-panthers-respond" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a handwritten letter and some signed memorabilia</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[There are times when trades in football work out for all parties involved. But that's not always the case. Here's a look at the 12 worst NFL trades ever.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s always a bit of risk involved any time an NFL organization <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-worst-decisions-chip-kelly-made-with-the-eagles.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chooses to make a trade</a>. But in that moment, the team's front office has to be convinced that it is making a decision for the betterment of the franchise as a whole. Whether there’s a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nfl-draft-6-best-picks-of-the-first-round.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">player in the draft</a> who the team likes, or if it’s just time to shake things up, wheeling and dealing is all a part of the game. But that doesn’t mean it always goes as planned.

It would be nice if every team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/your-cheat-sheet-to-nfl-draft-day-trades.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managed to benefit equally</a> when they opted to make a deal, but that is completely unrealistic. Although there are occasions when trades work out for everyone, oftentimes, like the game itself, there are winners, and there are losers. With that in mind, here are the 12 worst NFL trades of all time.
<h2>12. The Raiders give up Randy Moss for a fourth-round pick</h2>
[caption id="attachment_780570" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-780570 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Randy-Moss-e1427825686127.jpg" alt="Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="546" /> Randy Moss | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2007, for some inexplicable reason that still makes no sense to this day, the Oakland Raiders decided to trade wide receiver Randy Moss, who was in the prime of his career, to the New England Patriots in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick. The Patriots robbed the Raiders blind on this deal, as Moss quickly proved that he was far more valuable than a mid-round pick.

In his first season in New England, Moss went on have 98 receptions, 1,493 receiving yards, and caught a league record 23 touchdowns. On top of that, he participated in his sixth Pro Bowl, made First-Team All-Pro for the fourth time, helped lead the Pats to a perfect 16-0 regular season, and played in his first Super Bowl.

<h2>11. Chicago Bears trade a first round pick for Rick Mirer</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672476" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672476" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rick-Mirir-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="21 Dec 1997: Quarterback Rick Mirer of the Chicago Bears is mobbed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense during the Bears 31-15 loss at Houlihan''s Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Mandatory Credit: Scott Halleran /Allsport" width="757" height="519" /> Rick Mirer is mobbed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defense during the Bears 31-15 loss| Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Seattle Seahawks took Mirer out of the University of Notre Dame with the No. 2 overall pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, and the Indiana native was being tabbed as the next Joe Montana by several scouts and coaches. And as it turned out, the only similarity Mirer had to Montana was that they both played quarterback for Notre Dame.

After Mirer played four largely disappointing seasons (he posted a 20-31 record in 51 starts) in Seattle, the Seahawks somehow suckered the Chicago Bears into giving them a first round draft pick in exchange for the once-promising quarterback and a fourth round pick. Mirer would go on to start only three games for the Bears, and the Seahawks would use the pick the acquired in the trade to select All-Pro cornerback Shawn Springs.

<h2>10. Washington Redskins trade up to get Robert Griffin III</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RGIII-NFL-Draft_Al-Bello_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Washington Redskins selected former Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III with the second overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. " width="757" height="522" /> Robert Griffin III | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

The Washington Redskins were able to grab quarterback Robert Griffin III with the second pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, but they paid a steep price in the process. In order to move up from No. 6 to No. 2, the Redskins sent the St. Louis Rams three first-round picks and a second-rounder. But the Skins needed a franchise quarterback, and at the time RGIII looked like he could be the guy.

In his first season under center, the former Baylor quarterback proved to be well worth the risk, throwing for 20 touchdowns, leading the Redskins to an NFC East title, making the Pro Bowl, and winning the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

Since that point, though, Griffin has struggled to adjust to the speed of the NFL, suffered multiple injuries, and lost his job with the Redskins to Kirk Cousins. We likely haven't seen the last of Griffin in the NFL, however, as he will have a legitimate chance to revive his career <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-the-addition-of-robert-griffin-iii-means-for-the-browns.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with the Cleveland Browns</a>.

<h2>9. Houston Oilers give away Steve Largent</h2>
[caption id="attachment_655500" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-655500" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Seattle-Seahawks-Steve-Largent.jpg" alt="Seattle Seahawks Steve Largent speaks on stage after the Seahawks defeated the Green Bay Packers in the 2015 NFC Championship game at CenturyLink Field on January 18, 2015 in Seattle, Washington.

For some strange reason, the Houston Oilers were never truly sold on Largent. They selected him in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft, and actually planned on releasing the future Hall of Famer before he even played a down of football for them during the regular season.

The Oilers would trade Largent to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for an eighth-round draft pick in what would ultimately go down as one of the worst NFL trades of all time. As history would have it, Largent would go on to be named All-Pro seven times, earn seven Pro Bowl selections, lead the league in receiving yards twice, catch 819 passes for 13,089 and 100 touchdowns, and get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>8. Mike Ditka loves Ricky Williams way too much</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ricky-Williams_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ricky Williams" width="758" height="505" /> Ricky Williams probably wasn't worth eight draft picks. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka loved running back Ricky Williams. He loved the former Heisman Trophy winner out of Texas so much so that he gave the Washington Redskins eight draft picks for the chance to select him in the 1999 draft. And as history would have it, that move didn’t exactly work out well for Ditka and the Saints.

They finished the season in last place in the NFC South with a 3-13 record, and Ditka was canned at the end of the year. Williams was eventually traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2002. This just goes to show that trading that many picks for one player is usually not good for business. Unless, of course, you work for <a href="http://blog.nola.com/saintsbeat/2009/04/wedding_photo_of_mike_ditka_an.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN Magazine</a>.

<h2>7. Atlanta Falcons send Brett Favre to the Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_624617" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-624617" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brett-Favre_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty ImagesQuarterback Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers during the first round playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin on January 9, 2004.

(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)" width="757" height="519" /> That's the look we imagine Favre had when he learned he was being shipped out of Atlanta |Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

This trade is a perfect example of how hindsight is always 20/20. While it is clear that the Atlanta Falcons were high on Favre’s football ability (they drafted him 33rd overall in the 1991 NFL Draft), the fact that they traded him after just one season is also very indicative of what kind of future they felt he had in the National Football League.

Years after his one-year stint in Atlanta, we all learned (<a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/03/18/glanvilles-eye-opening-explanation-of-trading-favre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks to an interview with former Falcons head coach Jerry Glanville</a>) that Favre battled substance abuse issues early in his career, and according to Glanville, his sobriety struggles were the reason the Falcons shipped him to Green Bay.

Still, this trade will forever go down as a terrible deal for the Falcons. They gave the Packers a franchise quarterback who would lead them to a Super Bowl title and go on to break nearly every major NFL passing record over the course of his career in exchange for one first round draft pick.

<h2>6. The San Diego Chargers strike out on Ryan Leaf</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ryan-Leaf_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Second overall pick Ryan Leaf shows off his jersey after being selected by the San Diego Chargers in the first round of the 1998 NFL Draft at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, New York.

The San Diego Chargers gave the Arizona Cardinals two first-round picks, a second-round pick, Eric Metcalf, and Patrick Sapp in order to move up to the second pick in the 1998 draft. The Chargers were perfectly content to select whichever quarterback the Indianapolis Colts passed on.

The Colts took Peyton Manning and San Diego was more than happy to land Ryan Leaf. Unfortunately, one of these two passers went on to have a Hall of Fame-caliber career, and the other turned out to be a major bust. It's safe to assume that the Chargers are wishing they could take a mulligan on that one.

<h2>5. Green Bay Packers hit the panic button</h2>

In 1974, after struggling to a 3-3 record to start the season, Green Bay Packers head coach Dan Devine felt that his team needed to make a change at the quarterback position in order to compete for a Super Bowl title that year. He responded by trading away five draft picks – two first rounders, two second rounders, and one third rounder – to acquire John Hadl, who was 34-years-old at the time of the trade, from the Los Angeles Rams.

This trade turned out to be one of the most lopsided deals in NFL history. In his one and a half seasons with the Packers, Hadl posted a 7-12 record while throwing six touchdown passes and 21 interceptions in 19 starts.

<h2>4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers trade Steve Young to the San Francisco 49ers</h2>

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had no time to wait for Steve Young to develop as a quarterback, so in 1997 they shipped him off to San Francisco for second- and fourth-round draft picks. Big mistake. We guess (and hope) that the Bucs learned a valuable lesson with this trade: Patience is a virtue.

Young eventually replaced the legendary Joe Montana under center and lead the Niners to a Super Bowl title in 1994. If you’re looking for any more proof that this deal didn’t work out for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, you can find it in in Canton, Ohio at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Young has had a bust there since 2005.

<h2>3. Los Angeles Rams waste Jerome Bettis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672492" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="size-full wp-image-672492" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jerome-Bettis-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="12 Sep 1993: Running back Jerome Bettis of the Los Angeles Rams moves the ball during a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California.

The Rams used the No. 10 overall pick in the 1993 draft to select Bettis out of Notre Dame, and for reason that remain a mystery to us, they gave up on “The Bus” after three seasons. In his three years with the Rams, Bettis rushed for a total of 3,091 yards and 13 touchdowns. The highlight of his stint with the Rams was his rookie year where he won the 1993 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award after rushing for 1,429 yards and seven touchdowns.

Following Bettis’ third season in the league, the Rams made the decision to move Bettis to fullback – which was a direct result of them drafting Lawrence Phillips, who is one of the biggest busts in NFL history, with the No. 6 pick in the 1996 NFL Draft. Shortly after making that head-scratching decision, the Rams changed course and decided to trade Bettis and a third round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for a second and a fourth-round pick. All Bettis did with the Steelers was rush for 10,571 yards and 78 touchdowns, and win a Super Bowl title. When it was all said and done, that was enough for him to earn induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>2. The Baltimore Colts trade John Elway to the Denver Broncos</h2>

John Elway made it perfectly clear that he had no intention of playing quarterback for the Baltimore Colts. Yet they still selected him with the first overall pick in the 1983 draft. The Colts would then quickly learn that Elway was not messing around. In the end, Baltimore was forced to deal him to the Denver Broncos for Chris Hinton, Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick.

Elway spent his entire 16-year career with the Broncos and led them to back-to-back Super Bowls titles as a player in 1997 and 1998, and he would later build a Super Bowl-winning team as the franchise's General Manager in 2015-16. Needless to say, the Hall of Fame quarterback has certainly left a lasting mark on the city of Denver.

<h2>1. The Vikings give Dallas a dynasty for Herschel Walker</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ty6Y2q-vm0I?rel=0"></iframe>

When Jimmy Johnson took over the Dallas Cowboys in 1989, he set out to rebuild the team in his image. Of course, to do so required sacrifice. In this case, that meant trading away superstar running back Herschel Walker, who had just rushed for 1,514 yards the season before.

The Cowboys traded Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for a king’s ransom of five players in eight draft picks. Dallas turned one of those draft picks into Emmitt Smith and wound up using another on Darren Woodson. And just like that, the Cowboys were well on their way towards crafting the NFL dynasty that would win three Super Bowls in the '90s.

		<description><![CDATA[The Houston Texans made a mistake by signing Brock Osweiler to a $72 million contract. Here's why they should move on from the 26-year-old quarterback.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_719170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Adam-Glanzman_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Houston Texans Need to Pull the Plug on Brock Osweiler" width="757" height="505" /> Brock Osweiler is fool's gold for the Houston Texans | Adam Glanzman/Getty Images[/caption]

The Houston Texans have been in the market for a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-starting-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">franchise quarterback</a> for several years. In fact, outside of a few solid seasons from veteran journeyman Matt Schaub, we can argue that the Texans have never actually had a legitimate game-changing quarterback in their 14-year existence as a franchise in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>. They made it painfully clear just how desperate they are to solve their problems at the position this past offseason.

In one of the biggest surprises of the free-agency period, the Texans <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-contracts-today.html/" target="_blank">lured 25-year-old Brock Osweiler away</a> from the Denver Broncos, signing him to a four-year, $72 million contract including $37 million in guaranteed money. And after one season, it looks like Houston paid top dollar for nothing more than fool's gold. With that said, the Texans have nobody to blame but themselves.

(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Brock Osweiler was upset about being replaced by Peyton Manning | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

When Osweiler hit free agency, he came off of a four-year run as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-peyton-manning.html/" target="_blank">Peyton Manning's understudy</a> in Denver. During that time he started a whopping (sarcasm) seven games -- all relieving Manning during the 2015 season. He compiled a 5-2 record (although credit for one of those wins <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000614597/article/peyton-manning-comes-to-rescue-for-denver-broncos" target="_blank">should go to Manning</a>) while throwing for 1,967 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions, which was good for a quarterback rating of 86.4. When it comes down to it, his overall performance was solid, but nowhere near spectacular.

Let's first consider Osweiler's reason for leaving the Broncos. <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/john-elway-surprised-brock-osweiler-got-bent-out-of-shape-about-benching/" target="_blank">Reports surfaced</a>, which were later confirmed by Broncos General Manager John Elway, that Osweiler was "bent out of shape" over being pulled from a game in favor of Manning, an NFL legend, during Week 17 of the 2015 season. Our first reaction to this news: "Who in the hell does this guy think he is? He was replaced by Peyton freaking Manning, not Geno Smith." That instance alone should have been a major red flag and signified to the Texans that Osweiler doesn't possess the maturity to effectively lead an NFL franchise.

Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

To be fair, Osweiler did turn in a couple of clutch performances during his stint as the starter in Denver. And there is no way the Broncos would have won the Super Bowl 50 title without his contributions. But at the same time, nothing about the 6-foot-7, 240-pounder's overall body of work suggests he is worth such a massive contract during free agency. If you ask us, the Broncos did nothing more than show loyalty and thank him for his role in their Super Bowl 50 triumph when they offered him a contract extension last offseason.

The former Arizona State signal caller has displayed a strong arm, but his throwing accuracy remains average at best, and his release continues to be long and slow. His pocket awareness and footwork look more like that of a rookie than a fifth-year pro who made $21 million this year; his ability to process information and read defenses makes us wonder what he's done in the film room since entering the NFL in 2012. It should really come as no surprise that all of these issues came to the forefront in Osweiler's first season with the Texans.

If Osweiler's on-field struggles aren't enough, there is also an <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/houston-texans-brock-osweiler-bill-obrien-disagreement-spat-team-meeting-tension-101616" target="_blank">ongoing rift</a> between he and Houston head coach Bill O'Brien. This shouldn't shock you considering the fact that Osweiler signed with the Texans <a href="http://broncoswire.usatoday.com/2016/03/30/brock-osweiler-was-signed-by-the-texans-without-ever-meeting-with-bill-obrien/" target="_blank">without having a sit-down meeting</a> or phone conversation with O'Brien <span class="s1">-- </span>a bone-headed move by all parties involved. The situation hit a boiling point when O'Brien benched Osweiler in favor of Tom Savage in Week 16.

Now, rumors indicate that the Texans may part ways with their head coach this offseason. We fully attribute this to O'Brien's tumultuous relationship with Osweiler.

Now to Osweiler's actual on-field performance in 2016. Here is a rundown of his total regular<span class="s1">-season </span>statistics in his first year with the Texans:
<ul>
 	<li>15 starts</li>
 	<li>8-6 record</li>
 	<li>59% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,957 passing yards</li>
 	<li>15 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>16 interceptions</li>
 	<li>6 fumbles lost</li>
 	<li>72.2 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>

Shea/Getty Image" width="757" height="529" /> Brian Hoyer was actually better than Brock Osweiler has been for the Texans | Thomas B. Shea/Getty Image[/caption]

Now, let's compare Osweiler's 2016 numbers to Brian Hoyer's 2015 stats. Hoyer started nine games for the Texans last year and made a total of just over $5 million for the entire season.
<ul>
 	<li>9 starts</li>
 	<li>5-4 record</li>
 	<li>60.7% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,606 passing yards</li>
 	<li>19 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>7 interceptions</li>
 	<li>91.4 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
As you can see, not only did the Texans fail to improve at quarterback in 2016, but they actually regressed substantially. When <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/elway-on-osweiler-a-lot-of-times-deals-you-dont-make-are-the-best-ones/" target="_blank">asked about Osweiler's play</a>, Elway said, "A lot of times those deals you don't make are the best ones."

[caption id="attachment_719168" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719168" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="The Houston Texans Need to Pull the Plug on Brock Osweiler" width="757" height="505" /> Brock Osweiler has been terrible in his first season with the Houston Texans | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

To be blunt, Osweiler was flat-out terrible in 2016. Out of all the quarterbacks with enough pass attempts to qualify, Osweiler ranks 29th in quarterback rating. The <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating" target="_blank">only player below him</a> -- Ryan Fitzpatrick -- was benched by the Jets.

Keep in mind that Osweiler did this with one of the better groups of wide receivers in the league. He had a solid offensive line and a top-10 rushing attack to fall back on. In a Week 7 matchup against his former team, Osweiler made it clear he isn't cut out to be the face of an NFL franchise.

In his first trip back to Denver since leaving the Broncos high and dry last March, Osweiler turned in one of the worst performances by a starting quarterback in NFL history. He finished the night with an average of 3.2 yards per pass attempt, which ranks as the <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLResearch/status/790766379313995777" target="_blank">third-lowest single-game total in NFL history</a> by a player with 40 or more pass attempts. More importantly, he looked like a confused and scared fish out of water for the entire game.

Granted, the Broncos have a great defense. However, any player with a championship-caliber competitive drive would never let his former team embarrass him during a prime-time game the way that Osweiler did. Following Denver's 27-9 win, Osweiler's former teammates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/sports/football/brock-osweiler-houston-texans-denver-broncos-quarterback.html?_r=0" target="_blank">didn't hold back their feelings</a> toward him either.

Chris Harris Jr. said, "It's not all about money in life. He had a great situation, great team here, better receivers, to me. So I think he already knows he made the wrong choice." Aqib Talib added, "If you look at it overall, he [General Manager John Elway] saved a bunch of money. And Trev [Trevor Siemian] is a great quarterback, man. He's better than Brock in my eyes. So it's a win-win situation." We simply can't argue with Harris or Talib's assessments.

We can adequately sum up Osweiler's time with the Texans with the following play:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/86VmhE7c3nM"></iframe>

<a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/texans-fans-raise-money-to-buy-out-osweilers-contract-broncos-fans-poke-fun-at-them" target="_blank">All joking aside</a>, the Texans won a division title in 2016, despite Osweiler's immense struggles. Luckily, they played in the weakest division in the National Football League, and they otherwise had a playoff-caliber roster. Osweiler is on track to finish as one of the worst quarterbacks in the league. So the Texans' chances at making any serious noise in the postseason were minimal in the playoffs.

At this point, the Texans have few reasons <span class="s2">-- </span>other than their <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/houston-texans/brock-osweiler-9867/" target="_blank">financial commitments</a> (they are basically tied to Osweiler for at least one more year) <span class="s2">--</span> to not think about going in a different direction at the quarterback position. They can still save their team if General Manager Rick Smith and owner Bob McNair (O'Brien gets a pass since he wasn't consulted in the signing) admit they made a monumental $72 million mistake in signing Osweiler last March.

The former second-round pick simply does not have the "it" factor that makes other quarterbacks great. It is becoming more and more clear that he does not have the respect nor the trust of his teammates and coaches. To be honest, their performance at the position couldn't get much worse than it was during the 2016 season. For the sake of their franchise, it's time for the Texans to pull the plug on the Brock Osweiler experiment.

		<description><![CDATA[Jim Harbaugh left the NFL for the the University of Michigan. Who else has successfully made the transition from the pro level to college?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_737230" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-737230 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Jim-Harbaugh_SF.jpg" alt="Thearon W.

It’s been assumed that, for college football coaches, the end-game has always been to coach in the NFL. But, for former San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, it’s “been there, done that," as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jim-harbaughs-recruiting-crazy-genius.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he gave up the Bay Area to become the head coach of the University of Michigan</a>.

It was surprising to many that Harbaugh would return to college coaching after already experiencing success at San Diego and Stanford University (not to mention the excellence he’d shown at the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/HarbJi0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pro level</a>). But, he is a Michigan alum, and the thought of coaching at his alma mater was too enticing for Harbaugh. He has done great things everywhere he’s coached, and that tradition continued upon his return, turning around a Michigan program that hasn’t been competitive in years.

If he continues on his current trajectory of success, he’ll join a list of coaches who have maintained success after returning to the collegiate level, and here are the best of those who have accomplished this task.

<h2>Honorable Mention: Dennis Erickson</h2>

<a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/dennis-erickson-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dennis Erickson</a> is the ultimate “journeyman" coach. While he has spent the majority of his coaching career in the NCAA, including winning two titles with the University of Miami (Fla.), Erickson also managed to have two <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/EricDe0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head coaching stints</a> in the NFL (1995-1998 with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seattle Seahawks</a> and 2003-2004 with the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco 49ers</a>). But, given that he has returned to coach in the NCAA three times (twice after spending time in the NFL, and once coming out of retirement), his love of the game clearly draws him to the college ranks.

There might not be a more heralded coach at the University of Florida than Steve Spurrier. In his 12 seasons running the program, Spurrier amassed nine 10-win seasons, including a National Championship in 1995, and a .817 winning percentage.

Still, in 2002, the Washington Redskins came calling, and Spurrier decided to take his talents to the pro level. However, his time in the NFL only lasted <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/SpurSt0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two seasons</a>, and he was right back to coaching in college in 2005, choosing to run the University of South Carolina program until he decided to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-coaches-who-could-replace-steve-spurrier-at-south-carolina.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retire early in the 2015 season</a>.

Unfortunately for Bobby Petrino, whenever his name is mentioned, it is often associated with <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2014/1/9/5288648/bobby-petrino-louisville-scandal-timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scandal</a>. A disappointing fact given that he has been a pretty dominant college football coach. He has run the show at Louisville, Arkansas, and Western Kentucky, and has been successful at all three programs. The same cannot, however, be said about his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/PetrBo0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time in the NFL</a>.

In 2007, Petrino <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3150783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up and left</a> the Atlanta Falcons after only 13 games in charge. He has been a college coach ever since, where he continues to win. Clearly, he is better suited for college ranks.

<h2>3. Lou Holtz</h2>

NFL Record: 3-10, .231 Pct.
College Record: 249-132-7; .651 Pct.

Lou Holtz is an absolute coaching legend. He will always be remembered, and has been <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3580512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">honored</a>, for his time coaching the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. It was during his tenure here that he captured the 1988 National Championship. But, before that happened, Holtz tried his hand in the NFL, coaching the New York Jets in 1976. Needless to say, with a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/HoltLo0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-10 record</a>, it did not go well. No matter. His legacy is still intact as one of the greatest college football coaches to ever live.

<h2>2. Pete Carroll</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703294" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703294 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Trojans-Helmet-Winslow-Townson-Getty-images.jpg" alt="Winslow Townson/Getty Images" width="757" height="493" /> Pete Carroll | Winslow Townson/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL Record: 87-66, .569 Pct.
College Record: 97-19, .836 Pct. (adjusted to 83-19 by NCAA)

Pete Carroll had two <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/CarrPe0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL gigs</a> before he ever found himself as a head coach in the college ranks. His record between the two jobs was admirable, at 33-31. However, they failed in comparison to what he accomplished when he took over the University of Southern California program in 2001. The best way to describe his stint would be sheer domination.

Let’s look at the <a href="http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/carroll_pete00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">numbers</a> from 2001-2009: 91 wins (reduced to 83 because of <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/ncf/news/story?id=5272615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCAA sanctions</a>), seven seasons with at least 10 wins, seven career Bowl Wins, and AP National Championships in 2003 and 2004. This list could go on and on, but the point is: This man did wonders as a college coach. And, he’s not too shabby in the NFL, having built the Seattle Seahawks into a dominant powerhouse with a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000322899/article/seattle-seahawks-stomp-broncos-for-super-bowl-win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Bowl win</a> and a return to football's biggest stage in 2015.

<h2>1. Nick Saban</h2>
[caption id="attachment_740982" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-740982 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Saban-Trophy-640x427.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="506" /> Nick Saban | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL Record: 15-17, .469 Pct.
College Record: 191-60-1, .760 Pct. (adjusted to 186-60-1 by NCAA)

Nick Saban is currently in a league of his own. When he coached LSU from 2000-2004, all he did was win 48 games, amass a .750 winning percentage, and take home a National Championship in 2003. So, in 2005, he decided to become the head coach of the Miami Dolphins. However, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/coaches/SabaNi0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL wasn’t as kind to Saban</a>. He left after two seasons with a combined record of 15-17.

In 2007, he returned to college and took over the University of Alabama football program. It’s been here that he has set the new standard for college football. He’s won three national championships, including three in a six-year span, and has Alabama in the first two ever <a href="http://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">College Football Playoffs</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Matthew-Stafford_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Quarterback Matthew Stafford passing against the San Diego Chargers in 2015 | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

When the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Football League</a> Players Association and owners agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in 2011, things around the league changed. While the game remained the same, there were many financial differences — mainly how the profits from advertisements, etc., were going to be allocated. But one other financial change occurred: the rookie wage scale.

Before the CBA took place in 2011, rookie wages were somewhat ridiculous. Both 21- and 22-year-old players were getting record-setting contracts — contracts that not even some of the best veterans in the league were getting. Owners didn’t like this, but they were forced to pay because their prized, youthful players would just hold out until they did.

Consider this: The then-St. Louis Rams drafted quarterback Sam Bradford in 2010 and he signed a six-year, $76 million contract. Since then, he has accomplished very little. In 2012, the Indianapolis Colts drafted Andrew Luck with the first overall pick. Luck signed a four-year, $22.5 million contract. That’s a difference of a little more than $7 million per year.

In order to make rookie wages a little more reasonable, owners and the players association created a rookie wage limit. In other words, each team gets a certain amount of money they can spend on signing their rookies and undrafted free agents. No more, no less.

A lot of the time, this has resulted in young players getting the league minimum (just look at third-round pick Russell Wilson’s initial four-year, $2.99 million contract). While this 2016 batch of rookies will assuredly not come remotely close to some of the pre-2011 rookie contracts, here are the 10 biggest rookie contracts -- in total, not annually -- in history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Aaron Curry, Seattle Seahawks: $60 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V7PM2M5k8VU?rel=0"></iframe>

Aaron Curry, a linebacker out of Wake Forest, signed this six-year deal in 2009. Despite the impressively large contract, he never really panned out (one of many instances likely leading to the league’s new rookie wage scale). He retired from the NFL in 2012 — he didn’t even last the entire six years on his initial contract — having recorded <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/aaroncurry/79842/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">203 combined tackles and just 5.5 sacks</a>. As a whole, Curry was a complete bust.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. JaMarcus Russell, Oakland Raiders: $61 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZubYpplmzVk?rel=0"></iframe>

JaMarcus Russell was drafted out of LSU with a lot of hype, evidenced by the Raiders taking him with the first overall pick in the 2007 draft. But similar to Curry, he accomplished diddly-squat. After three seasons in Oakland (and $32 million later), he was cut. Russell <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RussJa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started in 25 games over a three-year stint with the Raiders</a>, where he threw for 4,083 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 23 interceptions.

To top Russell’s struggles and inconsistencies, he also held out after the draft. While he still would’ve received a big contract as the top overall pick, his holdout got him even more money. Russell is considered to be one of the biggest flops in draft history, and despite his apparent attempt to make a comeback this season, he just didn’t have what it took to make it as a top quarterback — or any kind of quarterback, for that matter — in the NFL.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Jason Smith, St. Louis Rams: $61 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BEbz0RW5hVc?rel=0"></iframe>

If there’s one trend characterizing the majority of this list, it’s players who got large contracts and failed to deliver –again, a big reason for the new limits on rookie contracts. Jason Smith is no different. He was a big, strong offensive tackle out of Baylor, taken with the second overall pick in 2009. Unlike the players before him, though, Smith suffered from injuries, which started with a concussion in 2010. His tenure with the Rams ended after being traded in 2012 to the New York Jets.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Reggie Bush, New Orleans Saints: $62 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EVEHhQ5wTC8?rel=0"></iframe>

Reggie Bush had everything coming out of USC: athleticism, a Heisman Trophy, and the skills to perform in the NFL. While he certainly didn’t turn into the likes of Adrian Peterson, he’s had a good run at the professional level. Unfortunately, while 2015 marked his 10th season in the league, Bush only managed to get on the field for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BushRe00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five games with the San Francisco 49ers</a>.

Despite rushing for just 5,493 yards in his 10 years as a pro, Bush has also accumulated 3,508 receiving yards on 470 receptions and 53 total touchdowns. Needless to say, Bush is a dual-threat tailback, and what he lacks in his ability to pound the ball between the tackles, he makes up for with his versatility and good hands.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Gerald McCoy, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: $63 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pTnUPeuitq4?rel=0"></iframe>

With the third overall selection in 2010, Tampa Bay took Gerald McCoy, a defensive tackle out of Oklahoma. Both Ndamukong Suh and McCoy were selected within the top five that year, and both have since earned their big salaries. McCoy is a complete wrecking ball in the middle of the defense: he manhandles opposing lineman and completely disrupts teams’ offensive attacks. Not only has McCoy been named to the Pro Bowl four times (2012–15), he was also named <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McCoGe99.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All-Pro for a 2013 performance</a> that saw him finish with 9 sacks and 35 tackles.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions: $64 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WRj85xMsRIY?rel=0"></iframe>

Just as McCoy panned out on this list, Johnson has done so, too — maybe even more so. “Megatron,” as he’s nicknamed, has been one of the best wide receivers in the league since his first season while recently calling it a career with a total of 11,619 receiving yards and 83 touchdown receptions. While not everyone agrees, we think Johnson has mored than <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earned a place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Ndamukong Suh, Detroit Lions: $68 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WLW8sbevJlU?rel=0"></iframe>

Ndamukong Suh’s a unique addition to this list — while he has certainly earned his high salary, he also has a reputation, mostly based on his <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/detroit-bad-boys-ndamukong-suh-ejected-after-stomping-on-opponent?urn=nfl,wp12457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stomp in the 2011 Thanksgiving game</a>, for being a dirty player. Either way, Suh’s performance on the field (assuming he isn’t taking foolish penalties), has been top notch. Similar to McCoy, Suh is a force to be reckoned with in the trenches. Not only did he earn the<em> Associated Press</em> Defensive Rookie of the Year award, but he was also named to the Pro Bowl in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014. His performances in 2010, 2013, and 2014 were good enough to earn him a first-team All-Pro selection.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons: $70 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ufCwBzskI0I?rel=0"></iframe>

Matt Ryan was selected with the third overall pick in 2008 and received a whopping six-year, $70 million deal. At the time, this was a record-setting contract – something that hasn’t been too disappointing for Atlanta’s front office. To start, in 2008, Ryan earned the<em> Associated Press</em> Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Although he has yet to win a Super Bowl with the Falcons, he’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RyanMa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completed 64.3% of his passes for his career</a> and been named to the Pro Bowl in 2010, 2012, and 2014.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Matt Stafford, Detroit Lions: $72 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/2GCXSVkji3E?rel=0"></iframe>

The Lions were truly a victim of the lack of a salary restriction for rookies. Quarterback Matt Stafford is the third Detroit player on this list, and all three occurred between 2007 and 2010. This was partially due to how bad the Lions were — they regularly had top-five picks — but also due to poor foresight from Detroit’s front office.

But the truth is, Stafford hasn’t been a flop. Although he only played in three games during his sophomore-year campaign, Stafford hasn't missed a game since, and has <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrown over 4,200 yards in each of the last five seasons</a>. As far as the starting quarterback position is concerned, trust us, the Lions could do a whole lot worse.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Sam Bradford, St. Louis Rams: $76 million</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f5QY6YQxXnc?rel=0"></iframe>

Drafted in 2010 by St. Louis, "Sammy Sleeves" signed the last rookie deal of its kind. Not only did he become the highest-paid rookie ever, but the extremity of his contract likely had a strong effect on the collective bargaining agreement a year later. However, Bradford hasn’t lived up the expectations set forth upon his arrival. Not by a long shot.

He's torn his ACL twice, never had a winning season, and seems to believe he is above a little quarterback competition. His stint with the Rams never panned out, and it is only a matter of time before the same thing happens in Philadelphia. While he's not the same sort of bust that JaMarcus Russell was, he hasn't exactly been a franchise QB. And it's safe to say that he never will be.

		<description><![CDATA[The New England Patriots have a fairly lengthy history of bending the NFL's rules. Here's a look at the 4 biggest scandals in Patriots history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_761570" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761570" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/GettyImages-462690471.jpg" alt="Tom Brady of the New England Patriots yells to his teammates." width="757" height="509" /> Tom Brady of the New England Patriots yells to his teammates. | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Less than a week after the NFL accused the New England Patriots of bending the league formation rules, a scandalous controversy struck the team once again. This time, the scandal revolved around the Patriots <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-sports-scandals-of-2016.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using deflated footballs</a>.

At first thought, one may presume that deflated footballs would be a disadvantage. In reality, slightly deflated footballs are easier to throw and catch. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">Patriots</a>’ Deflategate scandal -- which consumed much of the NFL offseason and even extended into the first month of regular-season play with a four game suspension for Tom Brady -- was, to say the least, a bit of a reach. The team clearly didn’t need any illegal help in beating the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game and ultimately <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-makes-history-ranking-all-his-super-bowl-appearances.html/">winning the Super Bowl</a>.

The Patriots have a fairly lengthy history of bending NFL rules. Here’s a look at the four biggest scandals in New England Patriots history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Deflategate</h2>
[caption id="attachment_706681" align="aligncenter" width="759"]<img class="wp-image-706681" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tom-Brady-and-Bill-Belichick-e1415806241502.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Bill Belichick discuss the game." width="759" height="505" /> Tom Brady and Bill Belichick discuss the game. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

This is simply the latest in a long line of accusations against the Patriots. The NFL accused the New England of using slightly deflated footballs in their AFC Championship Game rout of the Indianapolis Colts.

The <a title="NFL Inflation Rules" href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/01/19/report-nfl-looking-into-whether-patriots-deflated-footballs-in-afc-title-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL’s rulebook states</a> that the footballs used in games must be inflated to 12.5<span class="s1">–</span>13.5 pounds per square inch of air. Each team is required to provide officials with 12 balls that are subject to testing prior to the game. Slightly deflated footballs are easier to throw and catch, especially in the rainy and windy conditions like the Patriots faced in the AFC Championship game. Would the air pressure of the footballs have altered the results of the game? Absolutely not.

In the end, the NFL <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pats-tom-brady-and-deflategate.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fined the Patriots $1 million</a>, suspended Tom Brady for four games, and stripped the team of their first<span class="s1">-</span>round draft pick in the upcoming draft. While Brady appealed the ruling, he ultimately <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-drafted-ahead-tom-brady.html/">served the NFL's suspension</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. “Deception”</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748446" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-748446" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady gathers the offense." width="757" height="533" /> Tom Brady gathers the offense. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

“Deception” happened almost exactly a week prior to Deflategate. In this scandal, the Patriots actually did nothing wrong; they simply used the rules of the game <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/these-nfl-teams-have-the-easiest-schedules-in-2017.html/">to their advantage</a>. Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh claimed his team was <a title="Patriots Substitutions are Deceptive" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000456365/article/john-harbaugh-pats-substitutions-deceptive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not given enough time</a> to establish which players were eligible and which were ineligible receivers. Was the tactic deceiving? Yes. Was it illegal? No. At least, not at the time; the formation is now illegal.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Spygate</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745011" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745011" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Brady-Belichick.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Bill Belichick discuss strategy." width="757" height="561" /> Tom Brady and Bill Belichick discuss strategy. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

This was far and away the worst scandal in Patriots history. In a way it tarnished the team’s legacy as one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-new-england-patriots-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfl.html/">best dynasties in NFL history</a>. In a game against the New York Jets in 2007, New England was caught videotaping the Jets’ play-call signals. After a thorough investigation, the league determined that this was a <a title="NFL Spygate" href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/12/they-are-cheaters-spygate-the-nfl-scandal-that-started-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">common practice</a> for the Patriots from 2002<span class="s1">–</span>07, which was during the peak of their success.

Commissioner Roger Goodell responded by fining the Patriots $250,000, taking away a first-round draft choice, and <a title="Bill Belichick Spygate Fine" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3018338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fining head coach</a> Bill Belichick $500,000. On a side note, Josh McDaniels, a Belichick disciple, was caught <a title="Spygate II" href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/josh-mcdaniels-spygate-2-denver-broncos-112910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filming the practices</a> of the San Francisco 49ers while he was the head coach of the Denver Broncos. The apple apparently doesn’t fall very far from the tree in New England.

<h2>4. The Snowplow Game</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748449" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-748449" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pats-Helmet-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="A New England helmet rests on the field." width="757" height="504" /> A New England helmet rests on the field. | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

This scandal doesn’t actually involve Bill Belichick. Way back in 1982, the Miami Dolphins were in Foxborough to take on the Patriots on a snowy December day. In a game that was scoreless heading into the fourth quarter, a <a title="The Snowplow Game" href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/12/happy-anniversary-to-nfls-infamous-snowplow-game/1#.VL6U51othUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial field goal</a> decided the outcome.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL</a> saw several legendary players hang up their cleats and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-retires-a-look-back-at-his-18-year-nfl-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retire from the game of football</a> in 2016. While saying goodbye to some of the biggest names in the sport is something football fans experience <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-nfl-offseason-mistakes.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every offseason</a>, last year marked one of the biggest mass exoduses of future Hall of Famers in recent memory. We decided that the time was right to rank the 12 biggest retirements of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-worst-free-agency-contracts-of-the-2016-offseason.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2016 offseason</a>.

A handful of retired NFL players -- tight end Heath Miller, offensive tackle Eugene Monroe, linebackers Jon Beason and Jerod Mayo, running back Jarryd Hayne, and wide receiver Ricardo Lockette -- who walked away from careers as NFL players just missed our cut, which speaks volumes to the caliber of player we included in our rankings. With that being said, here is a look at our rankings of the 12 biggest NFL retirements of the 2016 offseason.
<h2>12. Greg Jennings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673516" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673516" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Greg-Jennings_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Greg Jennings officially announced his retirement from the NFL in 2016. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

After a standout 10-year NFL career, Greg Jennings <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/17138866/greg-jennings-retires-nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced his retirement</a>. He was at his best with the Green Bay Packers from 2006<span class="s1">–</span>12, when he caught 425 passes for 6,537 yards, and 53 touchdowns, and earned trips to two Pro Bowls. He was also a key piece on Green Bay’s Super Bowl XLV-winning team in 2010. Jennings finished his career playing with the Minnesota Vikings (2013–14) and the Miami Dolphins (2015). In total, he had 571 receptions for 8,291 yards and 64 touchdowns.

<h2>11. Percy Harvin</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673514" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673514" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Percy-Harvin_Elsa_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Injuries forced Percy Harvin to retire after only seven NFL seasons. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Percy Harvin was easily one of the most explosive and versatile players the league has ever seen, but he struggled to stay healthy for his entire seven-year NFL career. Injuries ultimately ended his career, but when he was on the field, Harvin was a flat-out playmaker. In total, Harvin posted 9,086 all-purpose yards and 32 touchdowns. He won a Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks in 2013, and he was the NFL Rookie of the Year in 2009.

<h2>10. Charles Tillman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673511" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673511" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Charles-Tillman_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images-2-1024x656.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="485" /> Charles "Peanut" Tillman retired in 2016 after 13 NFL seasons. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

After 13 NFL seasons (12 with the Chicago Bears and one with the Carolina Panthers), Charles “Peanut” Tillman retired this offseason. He'll go down as arguably the best cornerback in Bears franchise history. During his time in Chicago, he earned two Pro Bowl and one All-Pro selections and helped the team reach Super Bowl XLI.

However, Tillman will forever be remembered for his ability to create turnovers by punching the ball out of opposing players’ hands using the "Peanut Punch." After helping the Panthers reach Super Bowl 50 in 2015, Tillman <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160722/sports/160729541/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed a one-day contract to retire</a> as a member of the Bears.

<h2>9. D’Brickashaw Ferguson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673502" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673502" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/D-Ferguson_Al-Bello_Getty-Images-1-1024x699.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="517" /> D'Brickashaw Ferguson retired after a 10-year career with the New York Jets. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

The New York Jets took D'Brickashaw Ferguson with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, and the former Virginia Cavalier would go on to play his entire 10-year professional career in the Big Apple, earning three Pro Bowl selections along the way. He was one of the few consistent performers on the Jets’ offense over the last decade, as he started in each and every one of the 160 regular-season games he was active for in his 10 seasons.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Matt Hasselbeck</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Matt-Hasselbeck_G.-N.-Lowrance_Getty-Images-1024x684.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="506" /> Matt Hasselbeck retired in 2016 after 17 NFL seasons. | G. N. Lowrance/Getty Images[/caption]

Many people forgot that Matt Hasselbeck was once one of the top quarterbacks in the league given that he spent the final four seasons of his professional career backing up Andrew Luck with the Indianapolis Colts. He was at his best during his 10 seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, where he was selected to three Pro Bowls and led the team to an appearance in Super Bowl XL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Justin Tuck</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673498" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673498" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Justin-Tuck_Al-Bello_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> With two Super Bowl rings in hand, Justin Tuck retired from the NFL. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Justin Tuck may not have posted gaudy statistics (66.5 career sacks is nothing to scoff at) during his 11-year NFL career, but that doesn’t change the fact that he was one of the premier defensive players in the league for most of the last decade. He earned All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors in both 2008 and 2010, and was an integral part of two Super Bowl championship teams with the New York Giants.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Logan Mankins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673497" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-673497" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Logan-Mankins_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-785x1024.jpg" alt="12 Biggest NFL Retirements of 2016" width="500" height="652" /> Logan Mankins retired in 2016 after 11 NFL seasons. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Given the position he played (offensive guard), Mankins flew under the radar for the bulk of his 11-year NFL career and never fully received the recognition he deserved. He was arguably the best guard in the league for most of his career, as evident by his seven Pro Bowl and six All-Pro selections. Unfortunately he never won a Super Bowl during his nine seasons with the New England Patriots.

<h2>5. Jared Allen</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673495" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673495" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jared-Allen_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images-1024x793.jpg" alt="NFL: 12 Biggest Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="586" /> Defensive end Jared Allen retired with the ninth-most sacks in NFL history. | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

Jared Allen entered the NFL as a fourth-round draft pick out of Idaho State University. He went on to become one of the best pass rushers the league has ever seen. In his 12 NFL seasons, Allen racked up 136 total sacks, which is tied for the ninth most all time, and was selected to five Pro Bowls and four All-Pro teams. Needless to say, Allen will soon have a bronze bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<h2>4. Marshawn Lynch</h2>
[caption id="attachment_572907" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572907" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Marshawn-Lynch_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-1024x824.jpg" alt="NFL: 12 Biggest Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="609" /> Marshawn Lynch retired from the NFL with plenty of gas still left in his tank. | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

If you follow the NFL at all, you likely know that Lynch marches to the beat of a different drummer. Knowing that, it should come as no surprise that he chose to hang up his cleats even though he was still capable of being a highly effective NFL running back. On the flip side, it’s also easy to understand his decision-making process.

Lynch was one of the most physical running backs the league has ever seen. His bruising running style resulted in him taking a pounding over the course of his nine-year professional career. Couple that with the fact that he was wise with his money, and it makes sense that "Beast Mode" chose to move on.

It will be interesting to see if Lynch ultimately ends up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but if it were up to us, he would be inducted.

<em>Update (4/26/17<span class="s1">)</span>: Lynch officially <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/857207917854031872">came out of retirement</a>, with plans to join the Oakland Raiders in 2017.</em>

<h2>3. Calvin Johnson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_600449" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-600449" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Calvin-Johnson-Leon-Halip-Getty-Images-1024x674.jpg" alt="NFL: 12 Biggest Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="498" /> Calvin Johnson's decision to retire at 30 years old shocked the NFL world. | Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

When Calvin Johnson announced his decision to retire, he shocked just about everybody. He walked away from the game at just 30-years-old. Judging by the fact that he caught 88 passes for 1,214 yards and nine touchdowns in 2015, he was still capable of playing at a Pro Bowl level.

During his prime, Johnson was arguably the most dominant wide receiver the league has ever seen. At 6-foot-5 and 239 pounds with 4.3-second speed, Megatron required double coverage out of opposing defenses to even slow him down (and most of the time that wasn’t enough). As a result, there is a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spot waiting for Johnson</a> at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.

<h2>2. Charles Woodson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_673493" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-673493" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Charles-Woodson_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-2-1024x810.jpg" alt="NFL: 12 Biggest Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="599" /> Charles Woodson hung up his cleats in 2016 following a brilliant NFL career. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Woodson was the No. 4 overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft <span class="s1">-- </span>the same draft class that produced Peyton Manning <span class="s1">--</span> following an outstanding career at the University of Michigan. (He capped off his college experience by winning the Heisman Trophy in 1997.) For as good as Woodson was in college, he may have been even better in the pros.

The Ohio native won one Super Bowl title. He participated in nine Pro Bowls and eight All-Pro teams, and he won the 2009 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. Statistically speaking, Woodson walked away from the game as the only player in NFL history with 50 interceptions (he totaled 65) and 20 sacks for his career. He also scored a whopping 13 defensive touchdowns. All said, Woodson will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest defensive backs in NFL history.

<h2>1. Peyton Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_602732" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-602732" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Peyton-Manning-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 12 Biggest Retirements of 2016" width="757" height="540" /> Peyton Manning retired after leading the Denver Broncos to the Super Bowl 50 title. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The NFL simply will never be the same without <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-favorite-teams.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peyton Manning</a>. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 draft revolutionized the quarterback position. He dazzled football fans for 17 seasons and picked apart opposing defenses unlike any quarterback the game has ever seen.

When it was all said and done, Manning retired as a two-time Super Bowl champion. He is a five-time NFL MVP, a 14-time Pro Bowler, and a 10-time All-Pro. Furthermore, he holds nearly every major NFL career passing record. Most widely consider him to be one of the top three quarterbacks in NFL history. And we know he'll join the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_707887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707887" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Peyton-Manning-500th-TD-640x426.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning celebrates with his coach as he walks off the field." width="757" height="503" /> Peyton Manning's career demands respect. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

It was a first quarter touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas against the Arizona Cardinals that made Peyton Manning <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of only two players in NFL history to eclipse 500 career passing touchdowns</a>. He went on to put up video game-esque numbers throughout the rest of the game, and by the end of the fourth quarter, he had thrown for a single-game career high of 479 yards with an average of 15.5 yards per pass attempt, had completed 66% of his passes, totaled four touchdown passes with two interceptions, and had a quarterback rating of 110.2. Officially announcing his retirement last year, Manning had countless astonishing statistical performances throughout the course of his <a title="Peyton Manning Records" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/4-records-peyton-manning-might-break-in-2014.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-setting NFL career</a>. So, how did his performance stack up against some of the other great performances of his career?

First, we’ll start by saying that narrowing down the top statistical performances of Peyton Manning’s career is no simple task. In doing so, we examined his completion percentage, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, quarterback rating, yards per passing attempt and, to a small extent, the magnitude of the win. With that being said, here is a look at 15 of the top statistical performances, in chronological order, of Peyton Manning’s NFL career.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>September 25, 2000 — Jacksonville Jaguars at Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707893" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707893 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Peyton-Manning-Colts-640x486.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="573" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Manning lit up the Jaguars to the tune of 440 yards and four touchdowns in this 43-14 win for the Colts. He completed 63.9% of his passes for 12.2 yards per pass attempt and a 143.3 quarterback rating.
<h2>October 22, 2000 — New England Patriots at Indianapolis Colts</h2>
Manning was nearly perfect in this 30-23 win for the Colts. He completed 80% of his passes for 268 yards and 13.4 yards per pass attempt. For the game, Manning had three touchdown passes and a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3.
<h2>November 10, 2002 – Indianapolis Colts at Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
This is another game in which Manning finished the day with a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3. He completed 78% of his passes for 319 yards, averaged 13.87 yards per pass attempt, and threw three touchdown passes in the Colts’ 35-13 win.
<h2>September 28, 2003 — Indianapolis Colts at New Orleans Saints</h2>
Manning was nearly perfect again in this Sunday Night Football matchup against his father Archie’s former team that the Colts won 55-21. He again had a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3 while completing 80% of his passes for 12.56 yards per attempt. The five-time MVP threw six touchdown passes, three of them to Marvin Harrison, and had 314 yards through the air in this game.
<h2>November 25, 2004 — Indianapolis Colt at Detroit Lions</h2>
Manning was thoroughly dominant in this game. He completed 82% of his passes for 236 yards and six touchdowns. His quarterback rating was 141.4 and he averaged 8.43 yards per pass attempt.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>January 4, 2004 — Denver Broncos at Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707894" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707894 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Peyton-Manning-Colts-Super-Bowl-640x448.jpg" alt="Donald Miralle/Getty Images" width="757" height="528" /> Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

This was the first of several dominating performances Manning had as a member of the Colts, his old team, against the Broncos, his current team. This 41-10 Wild Card Playoff win was, up to this point, statistically the best playoff performance in Manning’s career. He had a perfect quarterback rating of 158.3, completed 84.6% of his passes for 14.5 yards per pass attempt, and finished with 377 yards and five touchdown passes.
<h2>January 11, 2004 — Indianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
Manning had two of his best performances in the playoffs in back-to-back weeks. He led the Colts to a 38-31 win against the Chiefs by completing 73.3% of his passes for 304 yards and three touchdowns. His quarterback rating was 138.7 and he averaged 10.13 yards per pass attempt.
<h2>January 9, 2005 — Denver Broncos at Indianapolis Colts</h2>
Manning and the Colts again humiliated his current team 49-24 in this wild-card playoff game. He completed 81.8% of his passes averaging 13.88 yards per pass attempt. The 13-time Pro Bowl selection finished with 458 yards, four touchdown passes to one interception, and had a 145.7 quarterback rating.
<h2>October 29, 2006 — Indianapolis Colts at Denver Broncos</h2>
As you can see, Manning played some of his best football as a member of the Indianapolis Colts against the Denver Broncos. In this game, a 34-31 win for the Colts, Manning completed 82.1% of his passes for 345 yards and three touchdown passes. He averaged 8.85 yards per pass attempt and finished with a 129.2 quarterback rating.
<h2>January 24, 2010 — New York Jets at Indianapolis Colts</h2>
Manning was nearly unstoppable in this 30-17 AFC Championship win over the New York Jets. He threw for 377 yards and three touchdowns while completing 66.7% of his pass attempts. His quarterback rating was 123.6 and he averaged 9.67 yards per pass attempt.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>September 5, 2013 — Baltimore Ravens at Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707897" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707897 size-medium" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Peyton-Manning-Post-Game-640x447.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="527" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Manning and the Broncos sent a message in this season-opening 49-27 win. The Broncos were out for revenge following an early playoff exit at the hands of the Ravens the year before. Manning threw for a record seven touchdown passes to go with 462 yards and a 141.1 quarterback rating. He completed 64.3% of his passes for an average of 11.0 yards per pass attempt.
<h2>September 29, 2013 — Philadelphia Eagles at Denver Broncos</h2>
This was another one of Manning’s stellar performances during his 2013 MVP-winning season. He had his way with the Eagles defense completing 82.4% of his passes for 327 yards and four touchdowns. He had an impressive quarterback rating of 146.0 and averaged 9.62 yards per pass attempt.
November 10, 2013 — Denver Broncos at San Diego Chargers

Manning and the Broncos had the lead in this game from start to finish en route to winning 28-20. Manning completed 69.4% of his passes for 9.17 yards per attempt and a 135.2 quarterback rating. For the game, he totaled 330 yards passing with four touchdown passes.
<h2>January 19, 2014 — New England Patriots at Denver Broncos</h2>
Manning and the Broncos silenced a lot of critics in this 26-16 AFC Championship win over the Patriots. The 10-time All-Pro quarterback completed 74.4% of his passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. He had a quarterback rating of 118.4 and averaged 9.30 yards per pass attempt for the day.
<h2>October 19, 2014 - San Francisco 49ers at Denver Broncos</h2>
In this game, Manning broke Brett Favre's NFL record for most career touchdown passes when he connected with Demaryius Thomas for the 509th scoring strike of his legendary career. By the end of the game, Manning had completed 22 out of 26 pass attempts for 318 yards, four touchdowns, and a whopping 12.23 yards per attempt.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_709314" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709314" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tom-Brady-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady pumps his fist after throwing a touchdown pass | Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> Tom Brady never ceases to amaze | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

In spite of all the craziness that accompanied the 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">NFL</a> season, if there's one thing we've learned (or rather, relearned over and over again), it's that the New England Patriots are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-new-england-patriots-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfl.html/">the best</a>. At the heart of it all, there's one man who continues to, even at the ripe old of 39, light the world on fire. During the final week of the regular season, the great <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a> just so happened to do it again.

As the Patriots clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a resounding 35-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, Gisele's husband was busy making moves of his own, climbing to the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-moves-past-dan-marino-for-fourth-most-passing-yards-in-nfl-history/">No. 4 spot on the league's all-time passing list</a>. In a career filled with crowning achievements (which now includes winning a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-makes-history-ranking-all-his-super-bowl-appearances.html/">QB-record five Super Bowl titles</a>), this is just another example of why Brady is simply <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/">one of a kind</a>.

Of course, common sense says that Brady's probably too old to ever reach No. 1 on this particular list. And yet, who knows; this wouldn't be the first time the future Hall of Famer defied the odds. To see how his numbers stack up against some of the other <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">all-time great QBs</a>, here's a look at the 10 players with the most career passing yards in NFL history.

<h2>10. Ben Roethlisberger</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587360" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587360" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ben-Roethlisberger_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x434.jpg" alt="Ben Roethlisberger looks for a target | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="513" /> Ben Roethlisberger is a star in Pittsburgh | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 46,814 (and counting)

The Pittsburgh Steelers hit a home run when they drafted <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/">Ben Roethlisberger</a> with the No. 11 pick in the 2004 draft. After a 2016 campaign that saw him throw for 3,814 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions, the former Miami (OH) product and two-time Super Bowl champ attended his fifth Pro Bowl and now has 46,814 passing yards for his career. As long as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/disliked-nfl-players-today.html/">Big Ben</a> can remain healthy, it's only a matter of time before he climbs higher up the passing ladder.

<h2>9. Fran Tarkenton</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-jmCovYwkkU"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 47,003

Hall of Famer Frank Tarkenton could do it all on the football field. Dubbed "The Scrambler," the nine-time Pro Bowl kept defenses honest with an uncanny ability to evade them with his legs, while also consistently torching them with his arm. For his career, 18 combined seasons with the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, Tarkenton threw 342 touchdown passes and amassed 47,003 passing yards, good for No. 9 on the all-time list. In the modern game, where the athletic and mobile quarterback is king, today's youthful gunslingers can thank Tarkenton for paving the way.

<h2>8. Eli Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_610094" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-610094" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Eli-Manning_Elsa_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NewYork Giants QB Eli Manning celebrates a touchdown | Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Time to give some love to Eli Manning | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 48,214 (and counting)

His older brother may garner most of the praise, but Eli Manning definitely deserves love as well. Since entering the league in 2004, he's thrown for 48,214 passing yards (No. 8 all time), made four trips to the Pro Bowl, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">outdueled Brady</a> and the Patriots <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-new-york-giants-of-all-time.html/">in two Super Bowl appearances</a>. That's already a pretty solid career if you ask us.

<h2>7. Warren Moon</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Warren-Moon-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images-625x500.jpg" alt="Warren Moon is celebrated as an amazing QB | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="757" height="606" /> Warren Moon went to his fair share of Pro Bowls | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 49,325

Warren Moon's greatness cannot be understated. In 17 NFL seasons, the Hall of Famer made nine Pro Bowls, led the league in passing twice (1990 and 1991), and finished with 49,325 career passing yards. Like some other legit quarterbacks, we won't hold it against Moon that he was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-quarterbacks-who-have-never-won-a-super-bowl.html/">never able to win a Super Bowl</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_559073" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-559073 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/John-Elway_Elsa_Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="John Elway looks at the field as he manages the Denver Broncos | Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> John Elway can do it all | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 51,475

Prior to becoming one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-5-best-general-managers-in-the-nfl.html/">top general managers in the business</a>, John Elway was a half-decent player himself. OK, so maybe he was a bit better than that. In 16 NFL seasons, the Denver Broncos great won two Super Bowls, made nine Pro Bowls, earned an MVP award in 1987, and threw for 51,475 career passing yards.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Dan Marino</h2>
[caption id="attachment_528640" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-528640 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dan-Marino_Dolphins.jpg" alt="Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino gets ready to throw a pass | Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> Dan Marino was one of the best quarterbacks ever | RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 61,361

In a Hall of Fame career that saw <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/5-famous-nfl-players-who-lost-their-fortunes.html/">Dan Marino</a> make nine Pro Bowls and earn First-Team All-Pro honors three times, people tend to focus on the fact that he never won the Super Bowl. However, we think it’s more important to acknowledge the accomplishments of this <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-miami-dolphins-ever.html/">Miami Dolphins legend</a>. With <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MariDa00.htm">61,361 career passing yards</a>, Marino is No. 5 on the all-time list. Lombardi Trophy or not, we'll always consider this guy to be one of the best to play the position.

<h2>4. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_731093" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-731093" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tom-Brady-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Tom Brady wins a game and cheers | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Tom Brady continues to make his mark on the game | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 61,582 (and counting)

The New England Patriots drafted <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/">Tom Brady</a> in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, and it's safe to say the organization doesn't regret that decision. In 17 seasons, he has established himself as one of the greatest -- if not <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/">the greatest</a> -- quarterbacks in NFL history and shows no signs of slowing down. Brady has won 183 regular-season games, made 12 Pro Bowls (including 2016), won four Super Bowls, earned two MVP awards, and recently moved into fourth place on the all-time passing list with 61,582 career passing yards. It's good to be No. 12.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Drew Brees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_667479" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-667479" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Drew-Brees_Jamie-Sabau_Getty-Images-640x463.jpg" alt="Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints throws a first quarter pass | Jamie Sabau/Getty Images" width="757" height="548" /> Drew Brees is a future Hall of Famer | Jamie Sabau/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 66,111 (and counting)

Thanks to his latest 5,000-yard passing season (the fifth of his career), Drew Brees continues his assault on the NFL's passing list. Not only has the nine-time Pro Bowler now led the league in passing an astounding seven times, but his current total of 66,111 passing yards gives him a commanding hold on the No. 3 spot all time. If you ask us, Brees still <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/drew-brees-rank-nfl-history.html/">doesn't get enough credit</a> for his remarkable run.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Brett Favre</h2>
[caption id="attachment_837954" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-837954" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Brett-Favre_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brett Favre looks for a receiver | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="496" /> Brett Favre could sling the pigskin | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 71,838

Few quarterbacks in NFL history ever played the game like Brett Favre even though he no longer holds the top spot on the list. Whether he let it fly with the Green Bay Packers or showed off his cannon as a member of the Minnesota Vikings, Favre always played the game <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-oldest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">with such love and passion</a>, making him a true joy to watch. He is a legend, a Hall of Famer, and with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FavrBr00.htm">71,838 career passing yards</a>, No. 2 on the all-time list. Not bad.

<h2>1. Peyton Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_599739" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-599739" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Peyton-Manning_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning motions that he is No. 1 | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Peyton Manning is No. 1 | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career passing yards</span>: 71,940

Following a satisfying victory in Super Bowl 50, the remarkable Peyton Manning joined the long list of greats who chose to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-athletes-retire-champions.html/">walk away from the game as champions</a>. While the sport will definitely miss him, Peyton left a lasting legacy that we won't soon forgot; one that includes 14 Pro Bowl appearances, two Super Bowl titles, five MVP awards, and 71,940 career passing yards <span class="s1">-- </span>the most the game has ever seen. Yeah, we'd say that's pretty good.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quarterback is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">most important position</a> on the football field. NFL teams continuously invest early draft picks and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">hand out massive signing bonuses</a> to quarterbacks who, as the saying goes, couldn’t play dead in a Western.

With the huge investments that NFL teams make in their scouting departments, it’s hard to imagine that they will let a starting-caliber quarterback slip through the cracks and go undrafted, but every so often, an undrafted quarterback will surprise everyone and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-landing-spots-for-tony-romo.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">become an impact player</a> in the NFL. Here is a look at the top five undrafted quarterbacks in NFL history.
<h2>5. Dave Krieg</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728988 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dave-Krieg.jpg" alt="George Rose/Getty Images" width="757" height="1134" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>58.5% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>38,147 yards</li>
 	<li>261 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>199 interceptions</li>
 	<li>81.5 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>98 regular season wins</li>
 	<li>5 playoff wins</li>
</ul>
Krieg went undrafted out of Milton College in 1980. He went on to have a 19-year NFL career in which he made three Pro Bowls and was inducted into the Seattle Seahawks’ Ring of Honor. He spent 12 seasons in Seattle and led the Seahawks to the playoffs four times. After leaving Seattle, he had stints with the Kansas City Chiefs (two playoff appearances), Detroit Lions (one playoff appearance), Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears, and Tennessee Titans.

<h2>4.  Jeff Garcia</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728989 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jeff-Garcia.jpg" alt="Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images" width="757" height="512" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>61.6% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>25,537 yards</li>
 	<li>161 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>83 interceptions</li>
 	<li>87.5 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>58 regular season wins</li>
 	<li>2 playoff wins</li>
</ul>
Garcia went undrafted out of San Jose State in 1994 due to concerns over his size. After receiving very little NFL interest, he went North of the American border and played five seasons for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Garcia had a highly successful run in the CFL, winning multiple individual awards and a Grey Cup in his five seasons with Calgary, which lead to his signing with the San Francisco 49ers to be Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young’s backup.

Following Young’s retirement in following the 1999 season, Garcia won the starting job in San Francisco and played well enough to earn a trip to his first Pro Bowl. He went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL – five in San Francisco, one in Cleveland, one in Detroit, two in Philadelphia, two in Tampa Bay, and one in Houston – and was selected to four Pro Bowl rosters.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Tony Romo</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674861 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tony-Romo-Greg-Flume-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Greg Flume/Getty Images" width="757" height="500" /> Greg Flume/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>65.3% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>34,154 yards</li>
 	<li>247 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>117 interceptions</li>
 	<li>82.75 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>78 regular season wins</li>
 	<li>2 playoff wins</li>
</ul>
Romo surprisingly went undrafted out of Eastern Illinois in 2003. He received heavy interest from several teams, but ultimately signed with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent. He went on to break several Cowboys’ passing records and make three Pro Bowl rosters since taking over as the team’s starter in 2006.

The biggest knock on Romo in his 11 NFL seasons is the fact that he has struggled mightily in crucial situations and big games. The Cowboys released him after the 2016 season, so Romo's future is still up in the air. He still has a chance to erase his “choke-artist” stigma, and he'll likely end up with Hall of Fame-caliber statistics.

<h2>2. Warren Moon</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728990 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Warren-Moon.jpg" alt="Mike Coppola/Getty Images" width="757" height="973" /> Mike Coppola/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>58.4% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>49,325 yards</li>
 	<li>291 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>233 interceptions</li>
 	<li>80.9 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>102 regular season wins</li>
 	<li>3 playoff wins</li>
</ul>
Despite a highly successful college career at Washington, Moon went undrafted in 1978. After going undrafted and unsigned, he took his talents north of the border and played six seasons for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. Moon had a phenomenal run in Canada winning multiple MVP awards and five Grey Cup championships.

He decided to make the move to the NFL in 1984 and signed with the Houston Oilers. He spent 10 years with the Oilers, three years with the Minnesota Vikings, two years with the Seattle Seahawks, and two years with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was selected to nine Pro Bowls and the 1990 All-Pro team and set multiple passing records in his career.

Following his retirement, he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he had his jersey number retired by the Tennessee Titans (the former Houston Oilers).

<h2>1. Kurt Warner</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728991 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Kurt-Warner.jpg" alt="Jeff Gross/Getty Images" width="757" height="570" /> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

<em>Career Stats:</em>
<ul>
 	<li>65.5% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>32,344 yards</li>
 	<li>208 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>128 interceptions</li>
 	<li>93.7 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>66 regular season wins</li>
 	<li>9 playoff wins</li>
</ul>
Warner’s road the NFL has been <a title="Kurt Warner's NFL Journey" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1190204-kurt-warners-grocery-store-checker-to-nfl-mvp-story-a-tale-of-perseverance" target="_blank">well-documented</a>. He went undrafted out of Northern Iowa in 1994, and had a brief training camp stint with the Green Bay Packers that same year. After receiving no other NFL interest, Warner played in the Arena Football League for the Iowa Barnstormers from 1995-1997 and worked part-time bagging groceries. He tore up the AFL, and earned another NFL chance with the St. Louis Rams in 1998.

Warner made the Rams roster as the third-string quarterback in 1998, and was elevated to backup in 1999. An injury to starter Trent Green opened the door for Warner, and Warner rewarded the Rams with one of the best seasons by a quarterback in NFL history. He won the NFL MVP award and led the Rams to a Super Bowl title in his first year as a starter.

After a wildly successful run in St. Louis, Warner spent a year with the New York Giants, and then finished his career with the Arizona Cardinals. In his career, he won three NFC titles, made four Pro Bowls and two All-Pro teams and set numerous passing records along the way. Warner was a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, although he did not make it into Canton.

The evolution of the New England Patriot quarterback has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-5-new-england-patriots-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mirrored the performance of the franchise</a> from that of a perennial cellar-dweller toward one of the most <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-52.html/">respected dynasties</a> in the history of sports. You could say that the Patriot quarterback was first tasked with simply limiting turnovers and managing the game, before ultimately being called upon to make plays and carry the franchise upon his back. By extension, each of the three greatest quarterbacks in Pats history represents a different era in the team’s “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cities-multiple-sports-championships-single-year.html/">worst to first</a>" progression.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Tony Eason</h2>
[caption id="attachment_844776" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-844776 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Tony-Eason-Tony-Duffy-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="LOS ANGELES - 1986: Quarterback Tony Eason #11 of the New England Patriots rolls out under pressure during a 1986 NFL game against the Los Angeles Rams at LA Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.

The New England Patriots selected Tony Eason out of Illinois with the 15th overall pick out of the famed 1983 Draft, which also included John Elway (1), Todd Blackledge (7), Jim Kelly (14), Ken O’Brien (24), and Dan Marino (27). Marino, after falling late into the first round, quickly emerged to showcase his talents as the greatest pure passer in the game.  Meanwhile, Tony Eason was filling in as a solid, if unspectacular starter for the New England Patriots.

A pure game manager, Eason often handed off to a committee of running backs who would gash defenses for chunks of yardage behind Hall-of-Fame guard John Hannah. After establishing the run, Tony Eason would then go play-action, before hooking up with Irving Fryar over the top.

In 1984, one year after Mario took the Dolphins to the Super Bowl,  Eason did complete 60% of his passes for 3,228 yards and 23 touchdowns against only eight interceptions. This performance laid the groundwork for an improbable 1985 run, when New England won three straight playoff games on the road, and  to top it all off Eason outplayed Marino in Miami, in putting up three touchdowns to win the AFC Championship.

The 1985 Patriots, however, ran into the ultimate buzzsaw in the Chicago Bears, often referenced as one of the greatest football team of all time. In that game, Eason went 0-for-6, coughed up a fumble, and spent the evening running for his life. Then, the team benched him as he watched the 46-10 Super Bowl XX blowout come to an end.

<h2>2. Drew Bledsoe</h2>
[caption id="attachment_844806" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-844806 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Drew-Bledsoe-Jed-Jacobsohn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NEW ORLEANS - JANUARY 29: Quarterback Drew Bledsoe #11 of the New England Patriots speaks with ESPN's Stuart Scott during Super Bowl XXXVI Media Day on January 29, 2002 at the Super Dome in New Orleans, Louisiana. " width="757" height="506" /> Drew Bledsoe speaks to reporters | Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1993, the Pats took Drew Bledsoe with the first overall pick in the draft,  displaying their hope that this decorated junior out of Washington State would ultimately emerge as the franchise savior. At the time, Drew Bledsoe simply looked the part, a 6-foot-5, 240 pound quarterback with a rocket arm that also managed to say just the right things to fawning media and fans. Until then, the moribund Patriots had reached the pinnacle of their nadir, having served as cannon fodder to the ’85 Bears and losing Super Bowl XX.

After the draft, Drew Bledsoe, Bill Parcells, and Robert Kraft immediately went to work and began to earn respect for the franchise. The Patriots were 10-6 by Bledsoe’s second season, after working to limit turnovers, play lockdown defense, win special teams battles, and run the football. Drew Bledsoe, against this backdrop, picked his spots to go over the top to Terry Glenn, hit Ben Coates working the soft zone, or toss out a flare pass to Curtis Martin releasing in the flat. In 1994, Drew Bledsoe lit up defenses for a league-high 4,555 passing yards.

Like Tony Eason before him, Drew Bledsoe also led the Patriots through an improbable Super Bowl run (this time it was Super Bowl XXXI), before being blown out of the Big Game by Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. In 2001, Bledsoe was all set to start the Patriots on the march towards the playoffs again, before taking a vicious sideline hit in Week Two that knocked him out of the game. That turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to the franchise.

<h2>1. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_753534" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-753534" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Tom-Brady_Super-Bowl.jpg" alt="GLENDALE, AZ - FEBRUARY 01: Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots celebrates with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX at University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1, 2015 in Glendale, Arizona. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)" width="757" height="510" /> Could Tom Brady go down as the greatest QB of all time? | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Forced into the action after Bledsoe went down, Tom Brady, a former sixth round draft pick, was tasked with simply managing the game for the playoff-bound Patriots. In true rags-to-riches form, of course, Brady would go on to lead to Patriots to a 20-17 Super Bowl XXXVI win over the high-octane St. Louis Rams. Tom Brady, after watching Adam Vinatieri’s game-winning kick, proceeded to head-butt his teammates and shake his head at the improbable win amid swirling confetti.

As he gained maturity, Brady rapidly emerged as the leading man for his generation. In 2007, Tom Brady teamed up with the likes of Randy Moss and Wes Welker, to torch defenses for 69% passing, 4,806 passing yards, and a then record 50 touchdowns, en route to ripping off a 16-0 regular season record (2007 Patriots lost Super Bowl XLII to NY Giants). Incredibly, that statistical outburst is mostly a footnote beneath a career resume that lists out four Lombardi trophies and three Super Bowl MVP awards.

In 2015, Brady took a knee just in front of his own goal line, to close out his fourth Super Bowl title with the Patriots, entering himself into an exclusive club that includes names like Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana, as well as submitting his name into contention for the title of ‘<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-best-quarterbacks-in-the-league-today.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best NFL Quarterback of All Time.</a>’  Tom Brady, in setting the gold standard, has seen to it that any season that does not result in a Super Bowl ticker tape parade is dismissed as a total failure.

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a look at 5 current NBA players who have the athletic ability to play football in the NFL.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_722147" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722147 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jimmy-Graham-Dunk.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="555" /> Sean Gardner/Getty Images[/caption]

The list of college basketball players with limited football experience taking their athletic talents to the football gridiron seems to grow every year. It started with Tony Gonzalez, who was a two-sport star in college, and has continued with current All-Pro caliber tight ends Antonio Gates, Jimmy Graham, and Julius Thomas.

When an avid football fan watches an NBA game, it’s undoubtedly hard for them not to imagine some of the amazing athletes of the NBA in an NFL uniform.<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dunks-in-the-history-of-the-nba-slam-dunk-contest.html/" target="_blank"> Many professional basketball players possess a rare combination of size, speed, agility, and body control</a> that is, for lack of a better word, freakish. Recently, former University of Miami basketball player Erik Swoope decided to hang up his high tops, lace up a pair of cleats, and attempted to reinvent himself as a tight end in the NFL, and NBA staple Nate Robinson has made  waves by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-nba-free-agent-nate-robinson-intends-to-try-out-nfl-20160311-story.html" target="_blank">saying he'll try out for any NFL teams this offseason</a>. Here, then, is a look at five NBA players who could make the transition to playing in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Glen Davis, power forward, free agent</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722148" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722148 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Glen-Davis.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="861" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 9 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 290 pounds</li>
</ul>
Through nine NBA seasons, Glen Davis averaged a modest 8.7 points and 4.7 rebounds for his career. Had Davis chosen the football route when he was a blue-chip recruit in both football and basketball as a high school senior, we could be talking about a perennial All-Pro left offensive tackle instead of a NBA role player. With Davis’s size, strength, body control, length, and agility, he could easily neutralize the best pass rushers in the NFL today.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>LeBron James, small forward, Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722149" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722149 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LeBron-James.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="509" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 8 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 250 pounds</li>
</ul>
LeBron James’s football potential has been in the limelight ever since video of him as a <a title="LeBron James Football Highlights" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX_diVyt2XE" target="_blank">wide receiver in high school</a> went viral a few years back. As probably the most gifted athlete in the NBA in terms overall size, speed, and strength, James could almost surely make a living in the NFL as either a tight end or wide receiver. Imagine a player with Rob Gronkowski’s size and Dez Bryant’s speed and agility. That may be an over-exaggeration, but it’s hard to imagine any defender in the NFL being able to cover King James.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>John Wall, point guard, Washington Wizards</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-722150 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/John-Wall.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="487" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 4 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 195 pounds</li>
</ul>
John Wall is arguably the fastest player in the entire NBA, which means the guy can flat-out fly. Throw in the fact that he is 6-foot-4 with long arms and you have the makings of another Randy Moss-type of wide receiver.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Andre Iguodala, shooting guard, Golden State Warriors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_722151" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722151 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Andre-Iguodala.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="948" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 6 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 215 pounds</li>
</ul>
Andre Iguodala is athletic enough and big enough to guard four positions in the NBA. He also happens to be one of the most explosive, slashing athletes in the league, as well. He has the body to be either a wide receiver or tight end in the NFL, and a lot like LeBron, there would be very few players currently in the NFL that would have the ability to cover Iguodala on a consistent basis.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>Kenneth Faried, power forward, Denver Nuggets</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_722152" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-722152 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Kenneth-Faried.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li>Height: 6 feet, 8 inches</li>
 	<li>Weight: 228 pounds</li>
</ul>
Kenneth Faried is an absolute freak of nature. He has the type of size and athletic ability that would translate well to several positions in the NFL. Watching him play basketball, one can’t help but think about what kind of defensive end or linebacker he would make, but you also cannot deny that his speed, length, and leaping ability would come in handy offensively in the red zone. If Faried were to take part in the NFL Combine, even if it was just for fun, he would have scouts and coaches salivating at his football potential.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_688377" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-688377" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tom-Brady-Randy-Moss-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady rests on the bench." width="757" height="538" /> Tom Brady turns good wide receivers into great wide receivers. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is (supposed to be) entering the twilight of his career. His status as a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-tom-brady-looks-29-at-39.html/">39-year-old franchise superstar</a> puts him on the verge of the geriatric stage in the NFL. Don’t tell that to TB12 though, because he was still putting up monster numbers at the end of the 2016 season. Equally as important, his team is winning at a tremendous pace (can you say <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-makes-history-ranking-all-his-super-bowl-appearances.html/">five rings</a>?). Brady allegedly wants to play into <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25348959/tom-brady-says-he-has-10-years-left-wants-to-dominate-nfl-until-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his late 40s</a>. While that seems farfetched, we don't see any signs of him slowing down yet.

It’s been said many times that No. 12 hasn’t been dealt the most dominant hand of offensive teammates throughout <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">his 15-year career</a>. Some people speculate just how much crazier Brady’s statistics would be if he had the luxury of throwing to Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne, Jerry Rice, and Terrell Owens rather than the likes of David Patten, David Givens, Jabar Gaffney, and Donte’ Stallworth.

While we believe the sentiment is exaggerated, we understand the argument. After all, when you look at the NFL’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_career.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all-time reception leaders</a>, only two guys who played with Brady during their careers land near the top of the list. I<span class="s1">n honor of Brady's four touchdowns to four different receivers in New England's 2016 win over the Buffalo Bills, </span>let’s look at the five best wide receivers Brady has ever had in his career.

<em>Note: We stick strictly to wide receivers for this list. Therefore, we won't include guys like Rob Gronkowski.</em>

<h2>5. Julian Edelman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_893884" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-893884" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Julian-Edelman_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Julian Edelman celebrates a touchdown." width="757" height="505" /> Julian Edelman celebrates a touchdown. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics (regular season)</span>: 399 receptions, 4,152 receiving yards, 10.4 yards per reception, 23 receiving touchdowns in 99 games

Honestly No. 5 through No. 3 on this list were a toss-up in terms of order, but we stick Julian Edelman at fifth. Before 2013, Edelman would've landed nowhere near the top of this list. However, No. 11 rapidly ascended over the past few seasons. He is one of two <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-wide-receiver-duos-in-the-nfl-today.html/">truly dominant receiving options</a>, along with Gronk, who Brady has today.

Edelman’s 327 receptions come on 482 targets. While we don't know exactly how many of those came from Brady’s arm, we can say that almost all of them did. The former college quarterback is primarily used as a slot receiver, picking up chunk yardage on third downs frequently. But Edelman is actually fifth on Brady’s list of most touchdowns thrown to (with 21). The shifty wide out is just four TD hookups with Brady away from passing No. 4 on that list, a feat he should easily <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-new-england-patriots-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfl.html/">accomplish in 2017</a>.

<h2>4. Deion Branch</h2>
[caption id="attachment_918185" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-918185" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Deion-Branch-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Deion Branch holds the football as tight as he can. " width="757" height="483" /> Deion Branch holds the football as tight as he can. | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics (regular season)</span>: 518 receptions, 6,644 receiving yards, 12.8 yards per reception, 39 receiving touchdowns in 140 games

Deion Branch is another undersized wide receiver on this list. He's most well-known for his historic performance in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-makes-history-ranking-all-his-super-bowl-appearances.html/">Pats’ Super Bowl XXXIX victory</a> over the Philadelphia Eagles. On the world’s biggest stage, Branch hauled in 11 receptions (on 12 targets) for 133 yards, earning the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-super-bowl-mvps-of-the-last-25-years.html/">game’s MVP award</a>. Quite frankly, if not for Branch’s unbelievable effort, Brady almost certainly would have won this contest’s MVP too, giving him the honor in all four of his Super Bowl wins, instead of “just" three of them.

But Branch was far from a one-trick pony during his 11 years in the league. Securing his 518 career receptions on 883 targets, Branch demonstrated intense reliability, especially <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-bill-belichick-sent-packing.html/">during his first tenure in New England</a>. Of his 39 career TD receptions, 24 of them came from the arm of Brady, which puts him in fourth place on No. 12’s all-time touchdown receivers list.

<h2>3. Troy Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_918186" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-918186" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Troy-Brown-Doug-Benc-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady and Troy Brown talk as they walk off the field." width="757" height="521" /> Tom Brady and Troy Brown had a special relationship on the field. | Doug Benc/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics (regular season)</span>: 557 receptions, 6,366 receiving yards, 11.4 yards per reception, 31 receiving touchdowns in 192 games

If only Troy Brown were five years younger, we could have seen he and Brady in sync for years on end. Unfortunately, Brown was already in his ninth season by the time Brady took over the reins of the Patriots franchise, but for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-who-left-the-league-way-too-soon.html/">relatively short time</a> that they were together, this duo was terrific.

Brown did play all the way through the 2006 season (plus appearing in one game in 2007). During the early stages of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-greatest-5-new-england-patriots-of-all-time.html/">Brady’s amazing career</a>, No. 80 was certainly among his favorite targets. More or less than half of Brown’s career receptions probably came from Brady’s predecessor, Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady and this wide receiver built a solid repertoire during their six seasons together. In fact, 15 of Brown’s 31 career TD receptions came from No. 12, a figure that puts the receiver inside the top 10 of the quarterback’s top touchdown receivers.

<h2>2. Wes Welker</h2>
[caption id="attachment_694528" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-694528" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Wes-Welker-Jeff-Zelevansky-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Wide receiver Wes Welker speaks to the media during a press conference. " width="757" height="490" /> Wes Welker speaks to the media during a press conference. | Jeff Zelevamsly/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics (regular season)</span>: 900 receptions, 9,905 receiving yards, 11.0 yards per reception, 50 receiving touchdowns in 173 games

Before there was Edelman, there was Wes Welker. As automatic as they come, this <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-new-england-patriots-of-all-time.html/">undrafted player’s career skyrocketed</a> under Brady’s wing after three mediocre seasons to start his career in Miami. Edelman still has a ways to go to match what Welker accomplished with Brady, but the similarities between the two slot receivers are uncanny.

Edelman is actually listed as three inches taller than Welker. However, neither classify as big wide outs whatsoever. Welker was easily Brady’s most consistent target during their six seasons together and 34 of his TD catches came from No. 12. That gives the Texas Tech product the third most touchdown receptions from TB12.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Randy Moss</h2>
[caption id="attachment_857492" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-857492" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Randy-Moss-Miami-Dolphins-v-New-England-Patriots-otS6QkBxp5Ql.jpg" alt="Randy Moss makes a break for it." width="757" height="525" /> Randy Moss makes a break for it. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Career statistics (regular season)</span>: 982 receptions, 15,292 receiving yards, 15.6 yards per reception, 156 receiving touchdowns in 218 games

Randy Moss absolutely blows the competition out of the water on this one. “The Freak" is not only Brady’s greatest wide receiver ever, but one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-stars-who-you-wont-believe-got-cut.html/">greatest of all-time</a>, too. Moss had it all — speed, length, and unmatched athleticism. Unlike some of the other receivers on this list, Moss was not Brady’s first option on third and short. This guy was all about the long ball, as he and Brady hooked up many, many times for Hail-Mary-esque touchdown bombs during their three-plus seasons together.

When considering who ranks at the top of this list, all you have to look at is the 2007 season. The nearly perfect Patriots had arguably the best offense in NFL history, and Brady to Moss was the team’s most dangerous weapon. Of Brady’s record 50 TD passes that year, 23 of them went to Moss. In all, this duo connected an astounding 34 times for touchdowns during their careers, a mark that puts Moss in second on Brady’s list (a distant second behind Gronk).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_612149" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-612149" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Johnny-Manziel_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x442.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="523" /> Johnny Manziel's brief NFL career was disastrous. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Football League</a> employs some of the most gifted athletes on the planet. There are guys with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/12-fastest-40-yard-dashes-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-class speed</a>, agility, strength, and jumping abilities; guys who can throw or kick a football 80-plus yards; and guys who make 60-yard field goals look easy.

In actuality, every player who has found a place on an NFL roster possesses a skill set that is matched by <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Probability-of-going-pro-methodology_Update2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">far less than 1% of the general public</a>. As a result, we found that putting together a list of the worst players in NFL history is extremely difficult, and in a way, quite unfair. Still, we came up with a group of six players who negatively stood out from their peers to comprise our list of the worst NFL players in history.

Before we go on, we wanted to clarify and establish a few ground rules we used in our selection process. First off, we only considered inactive players from the Super Bowl era who had enough credited seasons to be eligible to collect retirement benefits from the league (guys like Johnny Manziel don't qualify). This helped weed out the worst NFL players who only played in a couple games, or those who had careers that only lasted one or two seasons.

Secondly, we did our best to exclude players who had their careers derailed by injuries. Lastly, we chose to only consider "skill position" players (you’re welcome, Tony Mandarich) because of the unavoidable subjectivity that comes with evaluating offensive and defensive linemen. With that being said, here is a look at the six worst NFL players in history.

<h2>1. JaMarcus Russell, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_648279" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-648279" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JaMarcus-Russell_Nick-Laham_Getty-Images-640x441.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="521" /> JaMarcus Russell will forever live in infamy as one of the worst players in NFL history. | Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>52.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>4,083 passing yards</li>
 	<li>18 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>23 interceptions</li>
 	<li>65.2 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>7-18 regular season record</li>
</ul>
Not only is JaMarcus Russell one of the worst NFL players ever, he is also arguably the worst draft pick in league history. As the Oakland Raiders' No. 1 overall selection in the 2007 NFL Draft, the former LSU Tiger’s first NFL contract included a whopping $31.5 million in guaranteed money.

After Russell’s disastrous three-year stint in Oakland, it’s safe to say that the Raiders got practically nothing in return. The simple truth of the matter is that Russell’s NFL struggles can be attributed to one thing: an atrocious work ethic.

He continuously showed up to team activities overweight and out of shape; he refused to put in the necessary time studying film and scouting reports; and he deservedly earned a reputation for being the last guy to show up to work and the first guy to go home at the end of the day. All of this showed on the field.

Despite having every physical trait that a coach could ask for in a quarterback -- including one of the strongest arms in the history of the game – Russell will now forever live in infamy as one of the worst NFL players we've ever seen.

<h2>2. Ryan Leaf, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ryan-Leaf_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="503" /> Ryan Leaf is undoubtedly one of the worst draft picks in NFL history. | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>48.4% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>3,666 passing yards</li>
 	<li>14 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>36 interceptions</li>
 	<li>50 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>4-17 regular season record</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately Ryan Leaf will forever be linked and compared to Peyton Manning. The two signal callers were widely considered to be among the best quarterback prospects to ever come out of college when they entered the 1998 NFL Draft, but as history would have it, their careers couldn’t have been more different.

Manning, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-retires-a-look-back-at-his-18-year-nfl-career.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who recently retired</a>, is arguably the greatest player in league history, and Leaf’s career lasted for just four awful (mostly) seasons. The San Diego Chargers were the unfortunate franchise that ended up with Leaf, who many scouts adamantly believed was a better prospect than Manning, and the former Washington State Cougar went on to last just three seasons in San Diego.

During his time with the Chargers, Leaf was a trainwreck both on and off the field, and is hands down one of the worst NFL players of the Super Bowl era.

<h2>3. Charles Rogers, wide receiver</h2>
[caption id="attachment_648281" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-648281" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Charles-Rogers_Danny-Moloshok_Getty-Images-434x500.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="873" /> Charles Rogers never lived up to his potential in the NFL. | Danny Moloshok/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>36 receptions</li>
 	<li>440 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>12.2 yards per reception</li>
 	<li>4 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Long story short, Charles Rogers is easily one of the biggest wastes of talent in NFL history. After a record-breaking college career at Michigan State, the Detroit Lions selected Rogers with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, and needless to say, their selection turned out to be a colossal bust.

Rogers battled a couple of injuries during his time in Detroit and also had several personal issues off the field, but at the end of the day, he simply wasn’t effective when he was on the field. His work ethic was subpar (that’s being nice about it), he struggled with dropped passes, and he never was able to adjust to playing in an NFL offense.

With that being the case, Rogers has a place on the list of the worst NFL players of all time, instead of enjoying the fame and fortune that comes with NFL stardom.

<h2>4. Akili Smith, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_648283" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-648283" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Akili-Smith_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images-631x500.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="600" /> Akili Smith's NFL career was a monumental disappointment. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>46.6% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,212 passing yards</li>
 	<li>5 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>13 interceptions</li>
 	<li>52.8 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>3-14 regular season record</li>
</ul>
From the early '90s through the early 2000s, the Cincinnati Bengals were to the NFL what the Cleveland Browns are to today’s NFL. So, it should only make sense that during that time, the Bengals had one of the worst NFL players ever in Akili Smith under center.

The Bengals used the No. 3 overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft to select Smith out of the University of Oregon, and on paper, it looked as though they were getting a future Pro Bowler. In his final collegiate season, Smith took the college football world by storm, throwing for 32 touchdowns and only seven interceptions.

He then put on a show at the NFL Combine (in every test but the Wonderlic), but in the end, none of it translated to success at the professional level. Smith would ultimately start only 16 games in four NFL seasons, and will forever be remembered for his ability to turn the ball over at an alarmingly high rate.

<h2>5. Lawrence Phillips, running back</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lawrence-Phillips_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="1153" /> The story of Lawrence Phillips and his NFL career is sad and disappointing. | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>424 rushing attempts</li>
 	<li>1,453 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>3.4 yards per carry average</li>
 	<li>14 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>34 receptions</li>
 	<li>219 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>1 touchdown reception</li>
</ul>
The story of Lawrence Phillips’ NFL career is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/football-players-ruined-nfl-careers.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both sad and frustrating</a>. After leading the Nebraska Cornhuskers to the 1994 national championship, it looked as though Phillips was destined for NFL stardom. As it turned out, the 1994 college football season would be the last time anyone would see Phillips dominating his competition on a football field.

His off-field issues have been well documented over the last two decades. There is no doubting that they played a role in his massively disappointing NFL career.

But when you look at his career from purely a football standpoint, it is abundantly clear that he just wasn’t an effective running back at the pro level. He averaged a paltry 3.4 yards per carry in 35 career games and was out of the league before his 25th birthday.

<h2>6. Heath Shuler, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_648286" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-648286" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Heath-Shuler_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images-412x500.jpg" alt="6 Worst NFL Players of All Time" width="757" height="920" /> Heath Shuler was one of the biggest flops in NFL history. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>Career Statistics</u>:
<ul>
 	<li>49.2% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>3,691 passing yards</li>
 	<li>15 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>33 interceptions</li>
 	<li>54.3 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>8-14 regular season record</li>
</ul>
The Washington Redskins drafted Heath Shuler with the No. 3 overall pick in the 1994 NFL Draft, hoping that he could resurrect their struggling franchise. Seeing as how Shuler has a place on this list, it’s fairly obvious that the Redskins ended up immensely disappointed by their investment in the former University of Tennessee quarterback.

In 13 starts with the Redskins, Shuler threw 19 interceptions and posted a 54.3 quarterback rating. He was traded to the New Orleans Saints following the 1996 season, and in his lone season in the Big Easy, Shuler threw two touchdown passes and 14 interceptions in nine starts for a quarterback rating of 46.6.

This was the final time we saw him in an NFL uniform. On a positive note, despite having one of the worst careers in NFL history, Shuler has been <a href="http://www.redskins.com/news-and-events/blog/article-1/Former-Redskins-QB-Heath-Shuler-Reflects-On-Life-In-Politics/993fcb00-c288-4b3c-b395-789213443a4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">highly successful</a> in his post-football life.

		<description><![CDATA[Many great Hall of Fame-caliber NFL players left the league last season. Which greats in NFL history chose the same path?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_717096" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-717096 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jake-Locker.jpg" alt="Jake Locker became one of the NFL players who left the league way too soon." width="757" height="504" /> Jake Locker became one of the NFL players who left the league way too soon. | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

Even if he was never going to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next World's Greatest Quarterback</a>, no one really saw Jake Locker's retirement coming. After being drafted eighth overall in the 2011 draft, the oft-injured Locker decided that it was in his best interest to retire. In a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000477807/article/jake-locker-announces-retirement-from-nfl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released in March of 2015, the QB discussed why this was the right play:
<blockquote>Football has always played a pivotal role in my life and I love the game, but I no longer have the burning desire necessary to play the game for a living; to continue to do so would be unfair to the next organization with whom I would eventually sign. I realize this decision is surprising to many, but I know in my heart that it is the right decision and I look forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests.</blockquote>
Apparently, the early retirement movement was just getting started. Later in the free agency season, 27-year-old free agent linebacker <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoriJa99.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Worilds</a> decided that he was <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12459034/linebacker-jason-worilds-retire-free-agent-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ready for the next stage of his life</a>. This decision was especially surprising considering that the former <a href="http://www.steelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pittsburgh Steeler</a> was set to become one of the more coveted free agents in 2015.

However, like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/whats-wrong-with-the-san-francisco-49ers.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Willis before them</a>, both Locker and Worilds believed that early retirement is in their best interest. And they are not the first players in the history of the sport to come to that conclusion. Here are the five greatest NFL players to retire early from the league.

<h2>1. Troy Aikman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709594" align="aligncenter" width="597"]<img class="wp-image-709594 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Troy-Aikman-341x500.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="875" /> Vince Bucci/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age of retirement</span>: 34</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AikmTr00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Troy Aikman</a> certainly had a Hall of Fame career. In his 12 seasons in the NFL, Aikman threw for 32,942 yards, 165 touchdowns, and finished with a 61.5 career completion percentage. He was also selected to six Pro Bowls and won <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/results/superbowl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three Super Bowls</a> as the quarterback of the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallas Cowboys</a> that built a dynasty in the 1990s.

There was nothing significantly wrong with Aikman’s career, except for the fact that he wasn’t able to play more seasons. At 34, continual back issues had a major role in his decision to hang up his helmet. If that wasn’t the case, who’s to say that Aikman wouldn’t have had a few more good seasons in him?

<h2>2. Bo Jackson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675300" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675300 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Bo-Jackson-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age of retirement</span>: 28</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Raiders</a> running back <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackBo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bo Jackson</a> had the goods. This guy was a physical specimen unlike the world had ever seen before; it was as if he were manufactured in a lab. Jackson was big and strong and insanely fast, and he had the potential to be one of the greats. By the time of his retirement in 1990, Jackson’s career average in yards per carry was a ridiculous 5.4, and he was only 28 years old.

Suffice it to say, Bo’s NFL career never reached the level of success that he experienced at <a href="http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/aub-m-footbl-body.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auburn</a>, where he was a two-time All-American and the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JackBo00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heisman Trophy winner in 1985</a>. If it wasn’t for a freak hip injury, there’s no telling what kind of damage Bo could’ve done in the National Football League. Unfortunately, that may be the one thing that Bo will never know.

<h2>3. Gayle Sayers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_770586" align="aligncenter" width="547"]<img class="wp-image-770586 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Gayle-Sayers-350x500.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="781" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age of retirement</span>: 28</li>
</ul>
Running back <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SayeGa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gale Sayers</a> was only able to play in the NFL from 1965 to 1971, but he still managed to prove just how special a player he was. He led the National Football League in rushing in both 1966 and 1969, and was selected to four Pro Bowls while also being named a first-team All-Pro five times. Sayers was so skilled that he was put on the <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/history/2010/1/17/nfls-all-decade-team-of-the-1960s---offense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL All-Decade Team for the 1960s</a>. Unfortunately, injuries forced this <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Bear</a> to call it a career at only 28 years old. Regardless, Sayers still managed to get inducted into the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/1977-ballot.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977</a>.

<h2>4. Barry Sanders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684769" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684769 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51635375.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="586" /> Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age of retirement</span>: 30</li>
</ul>
They broke the mold when they created <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SandBa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Sanders</a>. The <a href="http://www.detroitlions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detroit Lions</a> running back was so smooth and so sharp on the football field. Not only could he make you miss with his quick cuts and shifty movement, but when he put on the burners, he was simply uncatchable. Sanders may have decided to retire at the age of 30, but in his professional career he still made 10 Pro Bowls, was a six-time first-team All-Pro, and led the NFL in rushing four times. There have been a lot imitators since this superstar left the league, but in the end, there will only ever be one Barry Sanders.

<h2>5. Jim Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710118" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710118 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jimbrown-498x500.png" alt="" width="757" height="760" /> Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Age of retirement</span>: 29</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowJi00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Brown</a> was a force for the <a href="http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleveland Browns</a> from 1957 to 1965 and an absolute nightmare for anyone who was tasked with stopping him. In his nine-year career, Brown led the league in rushing eight times, made nine Pro Bowls, and was an eight-time first-team All-Pro. He would end his career when he was 29 years old with 12,312 rushing yard and 126 total touchdowns — Canton would come calling his name in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/1971-ballot.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1971</a>.

In the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a>, a team can only do so much when it comes to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-highest-salary-cap-space-2017.html/" target="_blank">circumventing the league's salary cap</a>. Unlike other professional sports leagues where willing teams are allowed to pay a luxury tax for having a total payroll that exceeds their respective salary cap, NFL teams are subject to fines, a loss of draft picks, and voided contracts for violating the league’s strict salary cap rules.

As a result, teams are constantly forced to restructure contracts and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-offseason-cuts-2017.html/">make the difficult decision of releasing</a> some of their most popular players to ensure that they remain in good salary cap standing. We have a pretty good idea of which teams will be up tight against the salary cap for the forthcoming season. With that being said, these 10 teams face serious salary cap issues in 2017.

<h2><!--nextpage-->1. Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663085" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663085" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Andy-Reid_Justin-Edmonds_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andy Reid watches his team from the sideline." width="757" height="505" /> The Chiefs have literally no money to spend this offseason. | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $166,978,353</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $21,647</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $1,882,210</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $7,020,634</li>
</ul>
Simply put: The Chiefs have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/which-team-has-the-toughest-2017-nfl-schedule.html/">a lot of work to do</a> this offseason to improve their current salary cap situation. They recently signed All-Pro safety Eric Berry to a massive contract extension <span class="s1">-- </span>a wise move in our eyes. However, now they have a mere $21,647 (before draft pick contracts are factored in) in cap space to work with this offseason.

The Chiefs do have a couple simple options that could instantly (and considerably) improve their cap standing. First, they will likely have to decline the 2017 option for backup quarterback Nick Foles. After that, they could restructure the contracts for quarterback Alex Smith (they could also cut Smith <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/you-wont-believe-where-vegas-thinks-tony-romo-will-play-2017.html/">if they land Tony Romo</a>), punter Dustin Colquitt, and wide receiver Jeremy Maclin.

It bears pointing out that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-stadiums.html/">Kansas City</a> must plan accordingly for contract extensions for outside linebacker Dee Ford and cornerback Marcus Peters. They will have to move quickly on their potential contract restructures if they hope to re-sign defensive tackle Dontari Poe.

<h2>2. Los Angeles Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_723153" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-723153" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Philip-Rivers-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="philip Rivers does agree with a refs' call." width="757" height="534" /> The Chargers will have a difficult time rebuilding with their salary cap situation. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $161,156,150</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $5,843,850</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $187,669</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $7,635,278</li>
</ul>
The Chargers' rebuilding job won't be easy given their current salary cap situation. They could help themselves out quite a bit by getting long-term deals done with outside linebacker Melvin Ingram and offensive guard D.J. Fluker, and looking into contract restructures for cornerback Brandon Flowers and offensive guard Orlando Franklin. Because as it stands now, the Chargers are projected to be almost $2 million over the salary cap when we factor in their rookie pool of money.

<h2>3. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743305" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743305" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dak-Prescott-Ezekiel-Elliott_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-1024x652.jpg" alt="Dak prescott and Ezekiel Elliott walk off the field together." width="757" height="482" /> The Cowboys won't have much money to work with this offseason. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $162,578,085</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $4,421,915</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $3,051,856</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $5,318,786</li>
</ul>
At some point this offseason the Cowboys will gain $5.1 million in cap space when they trade or release quarterback Tony Romo. Ridding themselves of Romo’s contract will definitely help, but it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jerry-jones-will-ruin-dallas-cowboys-season.html/">still won’t be enough</a> for America’s Team to have the cap space to adequately address their team needs this offseason. On top of that, the team will likely lose key 2016 contributors <span class="s1">-- </span>wide receiver Terrance Williams, offensive guard Ronald Leary, and cornerbacks Morris Claiborne and Brandon Carr <span class="s1">-- </span>during free agency.

We fully expect the Cowboys <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-potential-landing-spots-for-jamaal-charles.html/">to be aggressive</a> when it comes to contract restructures in the coming days. Candidates for new deals include tight end Jason Witten, linebacker Sean Lee, right tackle Doug Free, and kicker Dan Bailey.

<h2>4. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_697208" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-697208" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wentz-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images-1024x719.jpg" alt="Carson Wentz looks for a target in the backfield." width="757" height="532" /> The Eagles still have some salary cap work to do this offseason. | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $158,931,524</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $8,068,476</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $7,305,933</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $6,843,181</li>
</ul>
The Eagles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-contenders.html/">took a massive step</a> toward fixing their salary cap issues by trading quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings just before the 2016 season kicked off. That move alone wasn't enough, though.

As it stands, they are currently in good salary<span class="s1">-</span>cap standing, and would continue to be when all of their projected draft pick contracts are factored in. However, if the Eagles are going to spend any money during free agency (we believe they will go after wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Terrelle Pryor), they still have some work to do on the salary cap front.

To free up additional cap space, the Eagles could restructure the contracts for guys like defensive end Connor Barwin (also a candidate to get cut), quarterback Chase Daniel, offensive tackle Jason Peters, and outside linebacker Brandon Graham. It won’t be easy, but the Eagles’ 2017 salary cap situation is definitely salvageable.

<h2>5. Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_567568" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-567568" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bruce-Arians-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Bruce Arians yells to his players on the field." width="757" height="505" /> The Cardinals will have some tough decisions to make this offseason. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $147,711,035</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $19,288,965</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $440,461</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $6,848,817</li>
</ul>
The Cardinals currently have enough available salary cap space to have a comfortable offseason. That said, they do not have enough cap room to re-sign their top two impending free agents (defensive lineman Calais Campbell and safety Tony Jefferson), all of their draft picks, and their second-tier impending free agents (tight end Jermaine Gresham, linebacker Kevin Minter, and safety D.J. Swearinger).

At the end of the day, the Cardinals will likely be forced to <a href="http://cardswire.usatoday.com/2017/03/06/cardinals-likely-to-focus-on-re-signing-te-jermaine-gresham-s-d-j-swearinger/" target="_blank">part ways with both Campbell and Jefferson</a>. They will be very limited when it comes to pursuing free-agent talent this offseason.

<h2>6. Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663093" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663093" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Joe-Flacco_Jared-Wickerham_Getty-Images-2-1024x699.jpg" alt="Joe Flacco warms up before a game." width="757" height="517" /> Joe Flacco's contract has put the Ravens in a bind. | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $152,745,675</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $14,254,345</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $5,399,264</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $6,128,388</li>
</ul>
The Ravens have been up tight against the salary cap ever since <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-contracts-today.html/">re-signing quarterback Joe Flacco</a> to a massive contract extension following their Super Bowl victory in 2013. This trend will continue into the 2017 season after Flacco signed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-who-were-massively-overpaid-in-2016.html/">another huge contract extension</a> this March.

To be fair, the Ravens’ cap issues aren’t entirely due to them <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">overpaying for an average quarterback</a>, and they also aren’t beyond repair. They can easily create some cap space by restructuring the contracts for outside linebacker Elvis Dumervil, cornerback Ladarius Webb, and tight end Dennis Pitta.

They do also have to make a decision on the future of veteran wide receiver Mike Wallace. The 30-year-old speedster is a great fit in their offense, but would carry a cap hit of $8 million if the Ravens exercised his 2017 team option. In our eyes, the best move here would be to extend Wallace’s contract and lower his cap numbers.

While we don’t see them being able to create enough cap space to make necessary moves to reclaim a place as one of the top Super Bowl contenders in the AFC, we are confident that with Ozzie Newsome at the helm, the Ravens will be in solid cap shape by the end of the 2017 offseason.

<h2>7. Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Adam-Glanzman_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Brock Osweiler waves before a play." width="757" height="505" /> The Texans made a Texas-sized mistake in signing Brock Osweiler. | Adam Glanzman/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $143,355,802</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $23,644,198</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $59,710</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $5,462,811</li>
</ul>
After years of building their team through the NFL Draft, the Houston Texans went on a free agent spending spree last offseason. As a direct result, they have their work cut out for them from a salary cap perspective in 2017. Their highest profile signing from last year, quarterback Brock Osweiler, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-biggest-disappointmets-of-2016.html/">has been a complete bust</a>. With the structure of his contract, the Texans are stuck with Osweiler and his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-contracts-today.html/">$19 million cap hit</a> for at least one more season -- even if he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/houston-texans-need-to-pull-plug-on-brock-osweiler.html/">never sees the field</a> in 2017.

They currently have enough cap space to make a legitimate offer to their top impending free agent, cornerback A.J. Bouye. But if the Texans overpay for Bouye, they will run the risk of putting themselves in a position where they will be unable to re-sign guys like wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and outside linebacker Jadeveon Clowney, who will both command massive second contracts.

There are only a handful of viable options for contract restructures (linebacker Brian Cushing, offensive tackle Duane Brown, and cornerbacks Jonathan Joseph and Kareem Jackson) for the Texans, which means Houston will likely have to part ways with one or more notable veterans if they want to make a splash during free agency this offseason.

<h2>8. Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660656" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660656" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Matt-Ryan_Chris-Graythen_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Matt Ryan fist pumps after a touchdown pass." width="757" height="505" /> The Falcons won't have much money to spend this offseason. | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $143,120,700</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $23,879,300</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $2,977,670</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $4,645,585</li>
</ul>
The Falcons are currently in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-atlanta-falcons-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfc.html/">decent salary cap shape</a>. Unfortunately, this will change as they start to sign their young talent to hefty contract extensions. They are <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000790576/article/report-desmond-trufant-falcons-talks-heating-up" target="_blank">currently working on a deal</a> for cornerback Desmond Trufant. Based on the going market rate for young, elite cornerbacks, the reigning NFC Champions will likely end up giving Trufant a five-year contract that pays him $12<span class="s1">–</span>$15 million per year with $30 million in guaranteed money.

After Trufant, the Falcons eventually must think about locking up running backs Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman, left tackle Jake Matthews, wide receiver Taylor Gabriel, defensive tackle Ra’Shede Hageman, and outside linebacker Vic Beasley. Beyond that, Atlanta also must work on what will likely be a record-breaking contract extension for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-atlanta-falcons-of-all-time.html/">2016 NFL MVP Matt Ryan</a>. Needless to say, General Manager Thomas Dmitroff will have to find creative ways to keep the Falcons’ salary cap in good standing.

<h2>9. New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742595" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-742595" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Odell-Beckham-Jr.-Al-Bello-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Odell Beckham Jr. celebrates." width="757" height="505" /> Odell Beckham Jr. is a special talent. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $2,899,441</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $5,507,011</li>
</ul>
The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/new-york-giants/">New York Giants</a> have a lot of salary cap work to do if they plan on being active during free agency this offseason. Fortunately for the G-Men, though, they are only a couple of key players away from being legitimate Super Bowl contenders.

They can free up quite a bit of cap space by working out a long-term deal with defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul. He is scheduled to play the 2017 season on the team’s franchise tag (carrying a cap hit of $16.934 million). Then, the Giants could restructure the contracts for offensive guard Justin Pugh (worthy of a long-term extension) and cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.

More importantly, the Giants also have massive contract extensions looming for wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and safety Landon Collins. Both are proven All-Pro-caliber players, and they need to plan accordingly.

<h2>10. Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682363" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682363" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Tyrod-Taylor_Brett-Carlsen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Tyrod Taylor walks off the field." width="757" height="505" /> The Bills have a decision to make on Tyrod Taylor. | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Total</u>: $146,872,830</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Salary Cap Space</u>: $20,127,170</li>
 	<li><u>2017 Dead Money</u>: $1,457,611</li>
 	<li><u>Projected Rookie Salary Cap Hit</u>: $6,315,953</li>
</ul>
If the Bills move on from quarterback Tyrod Taylor (a foolish move in our opinion), they will have a better salary cap situation; declining Taylor’s team option would free up just over $13 million in cap space. At the same time, without Taylor (or another proven veteran with a similar price tag), the Bills will instantly be destined for a top-five pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.

If the Bills want to re-sign cornerback Stephon Gilmore, they must hand over a five-year deal paying nearly $15 million per season. If that proves to be the case, Gilmore’s next contract will eat up a significant chunk of their available cap space. All said, Buffalo’s salary cap situation will keep them from making the necessary moves they need to make to contend for a playoff spot in 2017.

Vintage <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-green-bay-packers-of-all-time.html/">Green Bay Packer lore</a> is packed with images of the frozen tundra, Vince Lombardi at the board, and Paul Hornung running to daylight behind a wall of blockers on the power sweep. Central to this story, of course, is the fact that the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/cities-that-have-the-biggest-nfl-fans.html/">Packers</a> have benefited from spectacular quarterback play, in driving this venerable franchise to and through the modern era. In due time, the following three greatest quarterbacks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-stadiums.html/">in Packer history</a> will each be lionized with bronzed busts in Canton.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Bart Starr</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1leMrGVglQ"></iframe>
Bart Starr helped lay the groundwork for the first Packer Dynasty, and set in motion an ongoing reverence of the franchise that continues today. Starr quarterbacked the Packers to five NFL titles in seven years, between 1961 and 1967. This run did include a three-peat, when the Packers won one NFL title, before dominating the first two Super Bowls, by a combined 68-24 score.

Bart Starr went 9-1 as a postseason performer, after completing 61% of his pass attempts for 1,753 yards and 15 touchdowns, against only three interceptions. In 1967, Starr paced the Packers for two touchdowns through the air against the Cowboys, in frigid conditions, before setting up at the goalline. Bart Starr called his own number, and dove into the end zone, to close out the Ice Bowl and NFL Championship win. Also of note: The normally reserved and stoic Lombardi often offered up high praise for Starr, painting a picture of a coach describing a trusted decision maker.

<h2>2. Aaron Rodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_760863" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-760863" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaron-Rodgers_QB.jpg" alt="at Ford Field on November 28, 2013 in Detroit, Michigan." width="757" height="505" /> Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

Part of Aaron Rodgers’s legend will always be the snub. It’s hard to imagine now, but no Division I program wanted Rodgers out of high school in Northern California — in 2002, Jeff Tedford recruited Rodgers to Cal-Berkeley away from Butte College after visiting the small school to scout another prospect. Aaron Rodgers immediately lit up the Pac 10 competition for 5,469 yards and 43 touchdowns over the course of two years, at Cal. The legend was born, right?

Not quite. Rodgers was left on the 2005 draft board for the Packers to pick up at 24, after the hometown San Francisco 49’ers selected Alex Smith, with the first overall pick. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blrmdIfXPwI" target="_blank">In an E:60 documentary</a>, Rodgers described his draft day slide and interminable Green Room wait as “embarrassing.” After joining Green Bay, Rodgers backed up Brett Favre, for three years — a relationship summarized with a scoff, <a href="http://www.newsy.com/videos/green-bay-forgives-favre-inducted-into-packers-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank">as Favre famously stated</a> that “my contract does not say I have to get Aaron Rodgers ready to play.”<!--nextpage-->

In 2008, Rodgers was finally handed the keys to the franchise, after Favre retired, unretired, and publicly demanded his old job back, in front of adoring fans. Against this turmoil, Rodgers completed 64 percent of his passes, good for 4,038 yards and 28 touchdowns, through his first season as a starter. His individual numbers belied the fact that The Pack went 6-10 that year, and  ultimately Rodgers was still squarely in the shade of Favre’s formidable shadow, especially when the grizzled vet returned home to torch his former team as the quarterback of the hated Minnesota Vikings.

Rodgers has already admitted that Green Bay did not actually become his team and town, until 2010, when he led the Packers through an improbable Super Bowl run. That year the team finished 10-6, earned a Wild Card berth, and won three straight road playoff games before squaring off against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. Bringing the Lombardi Trophy home, Rodgers also claimed MVP honors after going over the top for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the Big Game.

<h2>1. Brett Favre</h2>
[caption id="attachment_835100" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-835100 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Brett-Favre-Mike-Stobe-Getty-Images-e1438952506854.jpg" alt="NEW YORK - AUGUST 08: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Brett Favre pose for a photo during a press conference to Welcome Brett Favre to New York at City Hall on August 8, 2008 in New York City.

Brett Favre will be forever immortalized as a Green Bay Packer, despite spending stints in Atlanta, New York, and Minnesota. The ultimate NFL iron man, Favre would grind through 20 NFL seasons and an improbable streak of 297 consecutive starts. In 2010, Brett Favre retired at 41 with ownership of every significant passing record on the books.

Brett Favre aired out the football for 5,377 completions, 61,655 yards, and 442 touchdowns with the Packers. In his prime, Favre led the NFL in total yards and touchdowns on several occasions. An unabashed gunslinger, Favre would often spin out of pressure behind the line of scrimmage, gather himself, set his feet, and take a shot downfield. After inevitably completing the big play, the larger than life Favre would whirl around, slap high fives, and pat each player on the behind.<!--nextpage-->

Brett Favre made Green Bay football relevant again, leading the team to back-to-back Super Bowl appearances in 1996 and 1997, serving as reigning league MVP in the process. To kick off Super Bowl XXXI, Favre dropped a 54-yard bomb to Andre Rison on just the second play of the game and, later that evening, Favre went for the jugular again, going over the top to Antonio Freeman, for 81 yards. Emerging victorious, Favre hoisted his Packer helmet into the air and sprinted down the field to meet his teammates and celebrate at the back of the end zone.

		<description><![CDATA[J.J. Watt and the Houston Texans looked like they were finally going to take the leap. Then, last season, they lapsed into obscurity.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="787"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/JJ-Watt_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="J.J. Watt" width="787" height="582" /> J.J. Watt may be well on his way to becoming yesterday's news | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

It's easy to forget now, but just about this time last year, J.J. Watt and the Houston Texans were poised to take the AFC South and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-houston-texans-are-absolutely-a-playoff-team-now.html/">make a real postseason run</a>. Watt closed out the 2015<span class="s1">–</span>16 regular season with 17.5 quarterback takedowns. He reigned supreme as the league’s Sack King for the second time in his career. It was somewhat obvious that he was well-equipped to become the NFL’s newest Golden Boy -- a player who wreaked havoc like Lawrence Taylor, pitched product like Peyton Manning, and still somehow found time to line up as tight end, too.

The wheels fell off last September, however; the Texans announced that Watt needed his second back surgery in three months and would be out for the entire season. Still, the reaction to this news was relatively muted; nobody seemed to really care. J.J. Watt fell off his pedestal and out of favor. We now have a problem in Houston, for these five following reasons.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Overexposure</h2>
[caption id="attachment_512667" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-512667" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/JJ-Watt_.jpg" alt="J.J. Watt" width="757" height="484" /> Watt is learning the hard way that NFL stardom can be difficult to maintain | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2011, J.J. Watt first arrived in the Lone Star State, where his salt of the earth Wisconsin values immediately endeared him to the local fans and Texas ranch culture. As a rookie, Watt became known for his unstoppable, high-powered motor: ignoring injuries and offensive linemen alike to go after the ball carrier at all costs. Off the field, he gained a reputation for living and breathing football, to the point where he readily admitted that he would rather lift weights and watch film than <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/southwest/story/jj-watt-is-single-and-it-is-all-because-of-football-100714">commit to a serious girlfriend</a>.

By his second year, in 2012, Watt was racking up 20.5 sacks for the season en route to claiming his first out of three Defensive Player of the Year Awards. The other two DPOY awards came back-to-back, between 2014 and 2015, when Watt went for a combined 38 sacks over those two years. In 2014, Watt scored two return touchdowns, off one fumble recovery and one interception, when he rumbled more than 80 yards to paydirt, as a 300-pound man.

In 2014, Watt became the wealthiest defensive player ever in the history of the NFL, after signing his six-year, $100 million contract with the Houston Texans. The endorsement deals came rolling in shortly thereafter, with Watt pitching product everywhere, from Papa John's pizza to State Farm insurance. Like Peyton Manning before him, the clean cut J.J. Watt had become so good, for so long, that he became boring, and too corporate. Manning went so far as to hawk Budweiser after winning his last Super Bowl, and was rightfully ripped for ruining the moment.

<h2>4. How 'bout 'dem Cowboys?</h2>
[caption id="attachment_721241" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721241" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ezekiel-Elliott-Dak-Prescott_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott" width="757" height="505" /> Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott were franchise-changing draft picks | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

The city of Houston has a familiar role for its professional football team: an oft-ignored sideshow to the Dallas Cowboys. In the late 1970s it was Earl Campbell that repeatedly rammed himself into stacked fronts at the line of scrimmage for the Houston Oilers, while a nimble Tony Dorsett skirted untouched, out around the edge for the Cowboys.

While the Cowboys would routinely make playoff and Super Bowl appearances -- including three victories on the NFL's biggest stage in four years during the '90s, and a cast of characters that included Jerry Jones, Jimmy Johnson, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin, Larry Allen, Charles Haley, and Deion Sanders --  the Houston Oilers were little more than a run-and-shoot gimmick, mostly known for giving up a 32-point playoff lead in Buffalo to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-backup-nfl-quarterbacks.html/">back-up quarterback Frank Reich</a>.

Ultimately,the Oilers would wind up moving to Tennessee in 1997 and being rechristened the Titans. While football would return to Houston in 2002, NFL fans have remained largely preoccupied with the latest drama coming out of Dallas, despite the fact that J.J. Watt and the Texans won the AFC South and made the postseason in 2011, 2012, and 2015.

Last season,the Cowboys raced out to an improbable 11-1 mark and became the first team to clinch a playoff berth behind <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/candidates-nfl-offensive-rookie-year.html/">hotshot rookies Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott</a>. The Texans, meanwhile, stumbled out the gates to a mediocre 6-6 and a first round exit, all but an afterthought when compared against America’s team up I-45.

<h2>3. Von Miller and Khalil Mack</h2>
[caption id="attachment_603327" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-603327" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Von-Miller_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL" width="757" height="505" /> Nothing brings praise like a dominant performance on the NFL's biggest stage | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Defense wins championships. Just ask reigning league MVP Cam Newton, who went a miserable 18-for-41 for 265 yards, while also throwing one interception, losing two fumbles, and taking six sacks in Super Bowl 50. Battered, Newton refused to address the media after the 24-10 blowout that saw Denver's Von Miller take home Super Bowl MVP honors, after dominating the line of scrimmage for 2.5 sacks, 5 tackles, and 2 forced fumbles. While Denver's defense was historically dominant, they were covering for a pair of decidedly sub par quarterbacks: Peyton Manning and new Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler. Miller, who emerged as the heart-and-soul of the stingiest defense in the league, signed a six-year, $114.5 million contract, in his own right, displacing J.J. Watt as the highest paid defensive player in the league.

Now, Khalil Mack is balling out in Oakland, as the next defensive force to take the league by storm. In 2015, Mack racked up 15 sacks and was the first player to ever go first team All-Pro at two positions, at defensive end and linebacker. The 2016 Raiders are young, gathered behind a hot shot young quarterback, and quickly growing their profile from a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-sleeper-teams-next-season.html/">sleeper team</a> into that of a legitimate Super Bowl contender. Above all else the NFL is a “what have you done for me lately” league, and Khalil Mack could surpass both J.J. Watt and Von Miller if the Raiders were to put together a deep postseason run in the near future, while the Broncos and the Texans are left to watch sitting at home.

<h2>2. Injuries</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594729" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594729" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/J.J.-Watt-Bob-Levey-Getty-Images-640x384.jpg" alt="J.J. Watt with head down on the football field" width="757" height="454" /> J.J. Watt on the football field | Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]

In September, the Houston Texans announced that J.J. Watt was set to undergo season-ending surgery. At that time, Watt had played in only three games last season and recorded 1.5 sacks, before complaining of lower back pain through a 27-0 blowout loss to the New England Patriots. Apparently, the offseason procedure to repair Watt’s herniated disk had failed.

At best, J.J. Watt will rehabilitate himself over the spring and summer, and be back to wreaking havoc through 2017. Meanwhile, Jadeveon Clowney and Whitney Mercilus can gain even more reps and experience as edge rushers. In 2015, Mercilus did tally up 12 sacks in his own right, and a healthy Texas D has already proven that it can dominate, if it can get <em>anything</em> out of former first overall pick Jadeveon Clowney.

Still, professional sports are littered with the remains of injured players, who were never quite the same. As a cautionary tale, J.J. Watt can look right across his own front seven at Clowney, who many have already ripped as an injury-prone bust, after tearing up his knee, spraining his foot, and tweaking his wrist, to the point where he can barely stay on the field. Expect Houston coaches and executives to use J.J. Watt as a decoy and renegotiate his contract for pennies on the dollar, if he fails to make a complete recovery from his bad back. Business is business.

<h2>1. Disappointing Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719167" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719167" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-2-640x427.jpg" alt="DENVER, CO - OCTOBER 24: Quarterback Brock Osweiler #17 of the Houston Texans during the game against the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on October 24, 2016 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images)" width="757" height="505" /> Quarterback Brock Osweiler  during the game against the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on October 24, 2016  | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

J.J Watt is often (unfairly) compared directly against Lawrence Taylor. In 1986, Lawrence Taylor came up with 20.5 sacks, and was the first and only defensive player to bring home the league MVP award. That year, the Giants went 14-2, and won Super Bowl XXI, after ripping through the postseason by a combined 105-23 score. Four years later, LT was again in on the action, when Scott Norwood and the Buffalo Bills went wide right, and the Giants claimed Super Bowl XXV.

For the sake of comparison, J.J. Watt and the Houston Texans have never advanced past the Divisional Playoffs, despite taking the AFC South crown in 2011, 2012, and 2015. In 2015, the Texans were shut out and embarrassed at home 30-0 in the Wild Card round, by a Kansas City club that had won 11 straight games at that point. Apparently, it was shoddy quarterback play out of the likes of Brian Hoyer, T.J. Yates, and Ryan Mallett that was holding J.J. Watt back from championship glory.

In response, the Texans rolled the dice and signed Brock Osweiler to a four-year, $72 million contract. Instead of getting their man at franchise quarterback, Osweiler looked every bit the part of a backup, in leading the league with 13 picks through 12 games before being humiliated against New England. Brock Osweiler is woefully shaky in the pocket, and rarely takes shots downfield. Opposing defenses have packed it in, and made life miserable for DeAndre Hopkins and the Texans offense.

J.J. Watt, instead of going down as one of the all-time greats, will be dismissed as a mere footnote in history if the Texans do not get their quarterback situation in order and start winning games late into January. It is Super Bowl or bust, from here on out.

		<description><![CDATA[With the emergence of Dak Prescott, Tony Romo has become expendable for the Dallas Cowboys. Here's the 8 most likely landing spots for Romo in 2017.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_710807" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710807" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tony-Romo-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sad season for Tony Romo so far | Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Dak Prescott makes Tony Romo expendable for the Dallas Cowboys | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

With every passing week of his rookie season, Dallas Cowboys rookie quarterback Dak Prescott <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jerry-jones-ruin-dallas-cowboys-season.html/" target="_blank">seemed to get better and better</a>. While having a rookie fourth-round draft pick, who made a paltry $833,393 (signing bonus included) in 2016, emerge as one of the best young signal callers in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> is undoubtedly a great thing for "America's Team," it also <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/you-wont-believe-where-vegas-thinks-tony-romo-will-play-2017.html/">signifies the end</a> of the Tony Romo era in Dallas.

When you consider Romo's lengthy injury history, his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/" target="_blank">bloated contract</a> (his scheduled cap hit for 2017 is $24.9 million), and his diminishing physical ability, then it's clear that the Cowboys had a hard time justifying keeping Romo on their roster going forward -- even if the 36-year-old is one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dallas-cowboys-players-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">best players in franchise history</a>. Knowing this, we compiled a list of the most likely landing spots for Romo in 2017.

[Editor's note 4/4/2017: It appears Romo is <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/04/04/report-tony-romo-plans-to-retire-from-football-go-into-broadcasting/">headed to the broadcast booth</a>, rather than another NFL team]<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_726735" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-726735" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dak-and-Romo-Wesley-Hitt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tony Romo laughs with Dak Prescott on the sideline." width="757" height="534" /> Tony Romo (R) supports Dak Prescott | Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]

You won't find teams like the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers on our list even though they both clearly have a need at the quarterback position in addition to having the salary cap space to make Romo a very healthy contract offer. With the four-time Pro Bowler's status as an established veteran on the last leg of his career, we just don't see any way that he would have interest in signing with the Browns or 49ers, who are each in the midst of massive rebuilding projects.

With that being the case, both franchises will more than likely <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-starting-quarterbacks.html/">go with a young quarterback</a>. With that said, these are seven most likely landing spots (in no particular order) for Romo in 2017.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_657141" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-657141" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ryan-Fitzpatrick_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-2-1024x709.jpg" alt="Tony Romo could replace Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has been a turnover machine in 2016 | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="524" /> Ryan Fitzpatrick is a turnover machine in 2016 | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/">New York Jets</a>' 2016 season was a flat out disaster. As a result, they will likely make wholesale changes in 2017. The first adjustment will likely include a changing of the guard at quarterback. Incumbent Ryan Fitzpatrick, whose time with the Jets is over, was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-starting-quarterbacks.html/">inconsistent and turned the ball over</a> at an alarming rate in 2016. Beyond Fitzpatrick, the Jets have a trio of young quarterbacks, but none of them have given any indication that they can be the long-term answer for the Gang Green.

When they are healthy and playing well, this team is talented enough to contend in the AFC. With a solid group of targets for a quarterback, this situation would appeal to an established veteran like Romo.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_576966" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-576966" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Carson-Palmer_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x670.jpg" alt="Tony Romo could replace Carson Palmer, who had faced injuries this season | Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="495" /> Carson Palmer struggles to remain healthy | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

If Carson Palmer could stay healthy and play up to his potential on a consistent basis, the Cardinals would have one of the more stable quarterback positions in the league. But the reality of the situation is that you <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-wish-season-never-happened.html/">cannot count on Palmer</a> to remain injury-free and play at an All-Pro level every week.

While Romo carries similar baggage to Palmer, the four-time Pro Bowler may be worth taking a chance on. For Romo, the Cardinals offer a roster already built to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-super-bowl-51-matchups.html/">compete for a Super Bowl title</a> right now, with one of the best groups of wide receivers in the league. Let's not forget, a similar move (adding <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-undrafted-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">Kurt Warner</a> at the end of his career) paid huge dividends for the Cardinals a few years back.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710880" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710880" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ryan-Tannehill-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images-1024x743.jpg" alt="Tony Romo could replace Ryan Tannehill, who has not been performing in Miami | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="549" /> Ryan Tannehill has not performed well in Miami | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite his late season success in 2016, we just don't buy the notion that Ryan Tannehill is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-paycut-2017.html/">going to develop</a> into the franchise quarterback the Dolphins have been searching for since Dan Marino retired. While we still believe Miami will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jay-cutler-potential-landing-spots.html/" target="_blank">make a play for Jay Cutler</a> if he becomes available next offseason, we'd be shocked if they did not at least entertain the idea of adding Romo for the 2017 season.

The Dolphins have an extremely talented roster. With better, more consistent, quarterback play they could <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-already-counting-season.html/">turn the corner</a> and become contenders in the AFC.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_732832" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-732832" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Trevor-Siemian_Jonathan-Bachman_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The jury is still out on Trevor Siemian | Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images[/caption]

Shortly after the Cowboys announced that Dak Prescott would be their full-time starting for the foreseeable future, reports surfaced that Romo had his sights set on continuing his NFL career with Denver Broncos. And when you look at the situation in Denver, it's easy to see why the Broncos are an appealing destination for an established veteran such as Romo.

The Broncos have two premier wide receivers (Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas); an elite defense; and a track record of finding success with veteran quarterbacks. For this scenario to come to fruition, though, two things would have to happen. First, Denver would have to be convinced that Trevor Siemian and/or Paxton Lynch cannot lead them to another Super Bowl title. Second, Dallas would have to release Romo (there is no way the Broncos would trade for Romo's contract as is).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709400" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709400" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jay-Cutler_Steve-Dykes_Getty-Images-1024x720.jpg" alt="Steve Dykes/Getty Images" width="757" height="532" /> The Jay Cutler era in Chicago will soon be coming to an end | Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

It's only a matter of time until the Bears officially put an end to the Jay Cutler era in Chicago. While we fully expect them to take a signal caller early in the 2017 NFL Draft, adding a veteran that is a true professional (such as Romo) to serve as a stop gap until their quarterback of the future is ready to take over could be an appealing option for the Bears. That said, playing behind Chicago's lackluster offensive line may not be something that appeals to the Cowboys' injury prone backup.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Houston Texans</h2>

Outside of the Broncos, this has to be the most appealing potential landing spot for Romo. The Texans play in a weak division, which would offer Romo an easy path to the postseason; they have a defense that is borderline elite; they have a good (not great) offensive line; they have a talented group of pass-catchers; and they have one of the better rushing attacks in the NFL. If Romo can re-capture his Pro Bowl caliber play with Houston, the Texans would be bona fide Super Bowl contenders.

<h2>7. Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676873" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676873" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Andy-Reid_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1-1024x712.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Andy Reid has a tough decision to make this offseason | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

As we mentioned when discussing potential landing spots for Jimmy Garoppolo, the Chiefs have a tough decision to make this offseason when it comes to the future of their quarterback position. It's looking more and more like their incumbent, Alex Smith, has reached his peak and taken the team as far as he ever will.

If the Chiefs decide to shake things up, adding Romo would make perfect sense given that their roster is built to win now. And let's be honest, if Romo proves to be his old self, the soon-to-be 37-year-old would be an upgrade over Smith.

<h2>8. Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682363" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682363" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Tyrod-Taylor_Brett-Carlsen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Brett Carlsen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Tony Romo could be in play for the Bills if they move on from Tyrod Taylor | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

If the Bills opt to move on from Tyrod Taylor this offseason (which would be a mistake if you ask us), Romo could be in play for Buffalo. He would give a relatively young Bills team a strong veteran presence in their locker room, and would give them more time to develop either Cardale Jones or one of the talented (but raw) quarterbacks that are available in the 2017 NFL Draft. If Buffalo decides to continue on with Taylor, there is no chance they will add Romo.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_724644" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-724644 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Deion-Sanders-Monica-Davey-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="485" /> Monica Davey/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Cornerbacks live life on the edge, where one mistake can result in a perfectly executed deep bomb and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/stocks/10-quarterbacks-with-most-touchdowns-peyton-manning-watch.html/" target="_blank">six points for the opposition</a>. After giving up the big play, a tough corner suffers from amnesia, because he must erase the latest setback from memory and stay aggressive, and any cornerback who shows fear and cowers behind the protection of a soft zone will get torched repeatedly in pass coverage. A corner, however, can even up the score with a well-timed interception and touchdown run-back of his very own.

In run support, a cornerback is often the last line of defense on the outside. When locking up against the toss sweep, a defensive back can either rise to the occasion and make a form tackle at the line of scrimmage, or get trampled by a big back who may then turn the corner and rumble for 50 yards into daylight.

Due to the high-risk and high-reward nature of this position, a good cornerback is similar to a riverboat gambler who knows how to take calculated risks. The greatest NFL cornerbacks of all time each held serve at the point of attack, never got beat deep, and were rarely even challenged. For opposing quarterbacks, betting the house against these ten shutdown corners was almost always a losing bet.

<h2>10. Dick LeBeau</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713954" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713954 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/156680499-e1413832721780.jpg" alt="Joe Sargent/Getty Images)" width="757" height="551" /> Joe Sargent/Getty Images[/caption]

Fittingly, Dick LeBeau starred as one of the all time great ballhawks before he went on to settle into his role of a madman defensive coordinator. As a coordinator, LeBeau has gleefully dialed up the 3-4 zone blitz throughout his career to pressure opposing quarterbacks, wreak havoc, and force turnovers while he called the shots in both Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. As a player, Dick LeBeau teamed up to form one of the greatest secondary units of all time in Detroit — with fellow Hall of Famers “Night Train” Lane, Yale Lary, and Lem Barney manning the defensive backfield.

LeBeau, a one-time cut off the Cleveland Browns, intercepted 62 passes for 762 yards and 3 touchdowns over his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LeBeDi00.htm">14-year career</a>. As of 2014, LeBeau’s 62 interceptions were still good for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/def_int_career.htm">ninth of all time</a>. An Iron Man, LeBeau appeared in 171 consecutive games between 1959 and 1971.

<h2>9. Lester Hayes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713957" align="aligncenter" width="504"]<img class="wp-image-713957 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/243401-e1413832824399.jpg" alt="Ron Haase /Allsport" width="504" height="757" /> Ron Haase /Allsport[/caption]

Lester Hayes has been historically underrated, in fact he still remains shut out of the Hall of Fame. Why? To many, Hayes was a “Bad Boy” Raiders cheater who would cover himself in a sloppy mess of stickum from head to toe on game day. With stickum, Hayes was better able to make plays on the football and snag interceptions in coverage. Throughout his playing days, Hayes also suffered from a stuttering condition, which masked his all-around intelligence to reporters and fans alike.

Beneath the hate for the Oakland Raiders shield, legions of football scholars may admit that Lester Hayes was one of the greatest shutdown corners of all time. In man-to-man coverage, Hayes was a master of the bump-and-run, where he would hand fight with a receiver at the line of scrimmage before blanketing him throughout the field. In a Super Bowl XVIII victory over the Washington Redskins, Hayes held Art Monk to only one catch and completely lorded over the left side of the playing field in a textbook demonstration of proper technique.

With 13 interceptions, Lester Hayes took home the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_NFL_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award">1980 AP Defensive Player</a> of the Year Award. In 1981, the NFL installed the Lester Hayes rule, which banned stickum from the game. Despite the rule change, Hayes still added four consecutive Pro Bowl appearances to his resume between <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HayeLe00.htm">1981 and 1984.</a>

<h2>8. Mike Haynes</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713962 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/76259319-e1413833034434.jpg" alt="Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="757" height="533" /> Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes were a package deal at cornerback. Haynes and Hayes joined forces after a 1983 settlement awarded Mike Haynes to the Los Angeles Raiders from the New England Patriots. For many, the Mike Haynes acquisition proved to be the missing link between the Raiders and another victory parade following Super Bowl XVIII. As a Raider, Haynes earned a trip to the Pro Bowl each year from 1984 to 1986.

Prior to his move to L.A., Mike Haynes was even more dynamic as a Patriot. Haynes set the stage for his <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=90">Hall of Fame career</a>, when he was named as the 1976 Defensive Rookie of the Year. In 1976, Haynes picked off 8 passes to go alongside his 608 total yards and 2 touchdowns in the punt return game. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HaynMi01.htm">By his 1989 retirement</a>, Mike Haynes had put in 14 years of service and made 9 appearances in the Pro Bowl.

<h2>7. Ronnie Lott</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713964 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/143551746-e1413833133822.jpg" alt="Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for Nike" width="757" height="522" /> Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images for Nike[/caption]

Ronnie Lott, of course, may be best recognized for his toughness and bone-jarring hits from the safety position. In San Francisco, Lott actually lined up at left cornerback during his first five NFL seasons before moving over to safety. As a safety, Lott was an enforcer who took pleasure in de-cleating wide receivers and actually ordered his own pinky cut off to stay in the game. At corner, Lott was still a standout performer who was selected to four consecutive Pro Bowls between <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LottRo00.htm">1981 and 1984</a>.

Ronnie Lott was the complete football player. It’s because of No. 42 that the 49ers could prove on the field that they were more than just a finesse team. From the cornerback position, Lott would lock up in man-to-man coverage, intercept the football, make tackles at the line of scrimmage, and tee off against quarterbacks in blitz packages. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LottRo00.htm">In 1983,</a> Ronnie Lott wreaked havoc with 108 tackles, four interceptions, and one sack as a cornerback.

<h2>6. Willie Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713966" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713966 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/295500-e1413833273268.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons /Allsport" width="757" height="504" /> Andy Lyons /Allsport[/caption]

Willie Brown has been hailed as the father of bump-and-run coverage. In bump-and-run, Brown would get physical to jam a receiver at the line of scrimmage and disrupt the timing of a pass pattern. From there, he would swivel his hips and stay in the receiver’s back pocket across the field. As a master of the technique, Will Brown picked off 54 passes for two touchdowns during his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowWi01.htm">16-year career</a> with the AFL-NFL Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders. With the exception of 1966, Willie Brown made his league’s Pro Bowl team every year between 1964 and 1973.

Willie Brown’s signature moment arrived during <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=36">Super Bowl XI</a>. In Pasadena, he intercepted a Fran Tarkenton pass and raced 75 yards into the end zone for a score. Willie Brown’s interception helped seal the 32-14 Super Bowl win for his Oakland Raiders.

<h2>5. Darrell Green</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713972" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713972 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52032207-e1413833495651.jpg" alt="TIM ROBERTS/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="495" /> TIM ROBERTS/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2></h2>
Darrell Green was all about speed and longevity. As a rookie, he made a name for himself when he chased down Tony Dorsett from behind to make a tackle. The legend of Darrell Green grew even stronger throughout the course of his 20-year career. Despite his small 5’-foot-9 stature, Darrell Green’s body of work was the stuff of tall tales.

Apparently, Green was still being clocked at sub 4.5/40 speed <a href="http://www.hailredskins.com/vbforum/archive/index.php/t-50926.html">at the age of 50</a>. During his prime, he starred as the undisputed <a href="http://www.darrellgreen.com/promotional-center/bio/">League’s Fastest Man</a>, with four annual titles in the competition. In 1987, Green broke his ribs on a punt return, but still outran the Chicago Bears for six in the NFC Divisional playoff at Soldier Field.

<h2>4. Deion Sanders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713974" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713974 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52034767-e1413833672498.jpg" alt="JOHN RUTHROFF/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="594" /> JOHN RUTHROFF/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Deion Sanders was one of the all-time great athletes in sports history. <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/deion-sanders-533274#natural-athlete">As a schoolboy legend,</a> Deion performed at an all-state level in football, baseball, basketball, and track and field for North Fort Myers High School. At Florida State, Sanders shattered records in baseball, football, and track before going pro with the Atlanta Falcons and Braves. In all walks of life, Deion Sanders was pure “Prime Time” entertainment.

In Atlanta, Deion turned the sporting world on its head, with his Neon Deion persona, <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=302">bandanna doo-rag</a>, high-stepping, and pitter-patter end zone dance. The Atlanta Falcons were transformed from a running joke into a “Too Legit Too Quit” event, with Deion Sanders literally headlining his own personal rap video at cornerback, kick returner, and wide receiver.

After owning Atlanta, the Prime Time sweepstakes transformed into a full-fledged bidding war. In 1994, Sanders signed with the San Francisco 49ers, and snatched up six interceptions, one Defensive Player of the Year award, and one blowout Super Bowl win against the San Diego Chargers. That next season, Deion was off to Big D where he helped the Cowboys lay claim to another Lombardi Trophy as a hired gun to shut down former teammate Jerry Rice.

<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/148958-the-fastest-40-yard-dash-ever">With 4.2-40 speed</a>, Deion Sanders could simply toss the textbook on form tackling and pass coverage technique into the garbage. On the edge, Deion Sanders was a reluctant tackler who would often feign an attempt at a stop before diving out of bounds. In team meetings, Prime Time was above the intricacies of defensive formations and audibles. In response to a Jimmy Johnson overhead projector tongue lashing, Deion Sanders proposed his own simple strategy: “I got that guy.”

<h2>3. Mel Blount</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713975" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713975 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/91161819-e1413833845144.jpg" alt="George Rose/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

Ironically, cornerback Mel Blount may have been mostly responsible for today’s five-wide sets and video game-like numbers in the passing game. The “<a href="http://timesdelphic.com/2012/09/10/three-rules-that-changed-the-way-the-nfl-is-played">Mel Blount</a>” rule prohibited defensive backs from making contact and harassing a wide receiver who ran five yards past the line of scrimmage upon his release. Prior to the 1978 rule changes, Mel Blount had made a career out of mauling receivers out of their breaks and physically imposing his will in pass coverage for the Steel Curtain.

At a wiry 6’3″ and 205 pounds, Blount loved to get physical, mix things up in the secondary, and stick his nose into the action to make tackles. According to the <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=30">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, Blount never gave up a touchdown as a rookie. After his stellar rookie campaign, Blount took home 1975 NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors with 11 interceptions in 14 games. Mel Blount ultimately went on to retire as a four-time Super Bowl champion as a member of the 1970s Pittsburgh Steelers’ dynasty.

<h2>2. Dick “Night Train” Lane</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713977" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713977 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2806629-e1413833974303.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="497" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Dick “<a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=120">Night Train</a>” Lane was the classic Horatio Alger rags-to-riches bootstrap story. Ella Lane raised Dick Lane as his mother after finding him abandoned as an infant. As a young adult, Lane dropped out of junior college before serving four years in the United States Army. Upon return to civilian life, Lane took up employment as a factory worker in Los Angeles. Dissatisfied with his job, he wandered into the Los Angeles Rams training camp for a tryout at end or wide receiver. By the start of the season, Lane switched over to cornerback and was installed into the starting lineup.

Before his retirement, Night Train was to emerge as one of the greatest defenders of all time, whose celebrity status was further solidified through his marriage to Dinah Washington. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LaneDi00.htm">Over the span of 14 years</a> in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Detroit, Lane snagged 68 interceptions for 1,207 return yards. As of 2014, his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/def_int_career.htm">interception</a> and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/def_int_yds_career.htm">return yard</a> totals are still a respective fourth and sixth of all time.

As a 1952 rookie, Night Train snagged 14 interceptions in a 12-game season. In 2010, Lane’s single-season interception record still stood as an untouchable mark. Beyond the interceptions, he was aptly named for his head hunting, which was legal at the time. As a tackler, Lane’s trademark move was to grab an opponent by the neck and violently slam his head into the ground. Dick Lane often stunned his opponents as if they were just hit by a speeding train.

<h2>1. Rod Woodson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713978" align="aligncenter" width="751"]<img class="wp-image-713978 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/98518080-e1413834098342.jpg" alt="Dave Martin/Getty Images)" width="751" height="486" /> Dave Martin/Getty Images[/caption]

Rod Woodson was everywhere. In the passing game, he could shut down a top receiver in man-to-man coverage, lurk within the soft zone to break up passes, and molly wop backs who released into the flat. In the running game, Woodson loved to get physical and execute textbook form tackles out on the edge. With Dick LeBeau dialing up the blitz in Pittsburgh, No. 26 was called out often to harass the quarterback into mistakes. Immediately after forcing yet another three and out, Woodson would then report for special teams duty as a punt returner.

After a typical day at the office, Woodson would have led his team in tackles, forced two fumbles, sacked the quarterback, snapped off one interception, and taken a punt back to the house. A true stat sheet-stuffer, Rod Woodson retired with 71 picks, 1,483 interception return yards, 32 fumble recoveries, 1,050 tackles, and 17 total touchdowns. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodRo01.htm">Over his 17-year career</a> with the Steelers, 49ers, Ravens, and Raiders, Woodson claimed the 1993 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award, 11 trips to the Pro Bowl, and one Super Bowl ring. Rod Woodson got it done.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_769603" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-769603" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Randy-Moss-Craig-Lassig-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Randy Moss celebrates a touchdown with his Minnesota Vikings fans." width="757" height="478" /> Randy Moss celebrates a touchdown with his Minnesota Vikings fans. | Craig Lassig/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

The Minnesota Vikings may be the most tortured franchise in the NFL, if not all of sports. For their part, the Vikings went to four Super Bowls, after the 1969, 1973, 1974, and 1976 regular seasons. They won none of them. After that, the Vikings went on to lose three tight NFC Championships in 1987, 1998, and 2009, by a combined total of 13 points, after late fumbles, missed field goals, and maddening penalties stalled game-clinching drives (The Vikes also lost the 2000 NFC Championship 41-0 to New York Giants).

In 2014, Adrian Peterson, the face of the franchise, was shut down for nearly the entire season for his role in a domestic violence case. With Peterson’s time in Minnesota in doubt, he is still very much deserving of an honorable mention. Peterson, at 29, lacks the longevity and playoff battles of many other reputable Viking greats.

Viking history, then, has been written by scores of otherworldly athletes who failed to put everything together in the biggest of moments. As a group, the top five Minnesota Vikings may be somewhat underrated, largely due to their inability to win the Big One.

<h2>1. Fran Tarnkenton</h2>
[caption id="attachment_769655" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-769655" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tarkenton-Cindy-Ord-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Fran Tarnkenton gives his commentary." width="500" height="656" /> Fran Tarnkenton gives his commentary. | Cindy Ord/Getty Images[/caption]

Scramblin’ Fran was the premier dual-threat quarterback of his era that revolutionized the game of football. Fran Tarkenton, a mobile quarterback, would use his feet to extend a broken play behind the line of scrimmage before firing a bullet down the seam for a big gain. As a last resort, Tarkenton would take off and run to move the chains and pick up a critical first down. At a slight 6-foot-nothing and 190 pounds,  he often mused that he largely took to scrambling out of fear and to avoid injury.

Tarkenton, of course, will always be recognized for his two tours of duty in Minnesota, which spanned from 1961-1966, and 1972-1978. As a Viking, he <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TarkFr00.htm" target="_blank">racked up 33,098 yards and 239 touchdowns</a> through the air. On the ground, Scramblin’ Fran picked up 2,548 rushing yards and 22 rushing touchdowns in Minnesota. By his 1978 retirement, Fran Tarkenton owned every significant passing record, after 18 years as a Giant and Viking. To date, only Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, and Michael Vick have surpassed Fran Tarkenton in rushing yards at quarterback.

Fran Tarkenton did lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls in 1973, 1974, and 1976. In Super Bowl IX, The Steel Curtain blitzed Fran Tarkenton into throwing 3 interceptions and a mere 102 yards on a miserable 11 for 26 passing.

<h2>2. Randy Moss</h2>
[caption id="attachment_769660" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-769660" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Moss-Heather-Hall-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Randy Moss of the Minnesota Vikings soars into the end zone." width="757" height="607" /> Randy Moss of the Minnesota Vikings soars into the end zone. | Heather Hall/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In many circles, Randy Moss rivals Jerry Rice as the greatest wide receiver of all time. A true physical freak, Moss stood 6-foot-4, ran a 4.25 40-yard dash, and was a schoolboy legend who lettered in football, basketball, baseball, and track and field in West Virginia. In 1998, Randy Moss was <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MossRa00.htm" target="_blank">still available at the 25th pick</a>, owing largely to character concerns, when the Vikings nabbed him in one of the greatest NFL Draft steals of all time.

As a rookie, Moss immediately took the League by storm, hauling in 69 catches for 1,313 yards (19 yards per catch), and 17 touchdowns. Moss was especially dangerous over the top, where he would beat cornerbacks deep and leap over safeties for jump balls. The 1998 Vikings went 15-1, after scoring a then-record 556 points through the regular season, only to lose the NFC Championship 30-27 to the Atlanta Falcons, when the normally sure-footed Gary Anderson missed a 38-yard field goal, with two minutes on the clock in the fourth quarter. They would ultimately lose in overtime.

As a Viking, Randy Moss did make it back to the NFC Championship Game in 2000, only to be blown out 41-0 by the New York Giants. In all, Randy Moss had 587 catches for 9,316 yards and 92 touchdowns, in eight years of service in Minnesota. Despite never winning a ring, NFL fans will always appreciate Randy Moss for busting coverage and racing down the sidelines for six.

<h2>3. Cris Carter</h2>

Cris Carter was one of the greatest possession receivers of all time. In Minnesota, Carter was somewhat of a reclamation project, after drugs and alcohol nearly derailed his NFL career out of Philadelphia. But as a Viking, he managed to reign in his bad habits and re-dedicate himself to his career. Over time, Carter was hailed for his crisp route running, soft hands, and use of the sidelines.

Over the course of 12 years with the team, Carter would <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CartCr00.htm" target="_blank">haul in 1004 catches for 12,383 yards, and 110 receiving touchdowns</a>. In 1994, Cris Carter led the NFL, with 122 receptions. The following year, he also hauled in 122 catches, which were then second only to Herman Moore (123). That year, Carter lead the NFL in touchdown receptions with 17, and would capture the NFL touchdown reception single-season crown in 1997 and 1999.

Cris Carter, of course, was a part of the 15-1 Viking roster that torched defenses in 1998. As part of this group, he worked the underneath routes, while Randy Moss stretched defenses deep and Jake Reed settled into the soft zone out of the slot.

<h2>4. Randall McDaniel</h2>
[caption id="attachment_769729" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-769729" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Randall-McDaniel-Joe-Kohen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Hall of Fame Inductees Jan Stenerud, Randall McDaniel, Marlo Thomas, Phil Donahue, Bobby Bell, and Paul Krause attend the 2014 Legends For Charity Dinner." width="757" height="498" /> (L-R) NFL Hall of Fame Inductees Jan Stenerud, Randall McDaniel, Marlo Thomas, Phil Donahue, Bobby Bell, and Paul Krause attend the 2014 Legends For Charity Dinner. | Joe Kohen/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1998, Randall McDaniel anchored an offensive line unit that helped set the season scoring record at 556 points. Critical in both pocket protection and road grading huge holes for halfback Robert Smith to gash defenses, McDaniel was at his best out in space, where he would pull as the lead blocker on counter traps. But he was also devastating in the screen game, where he would go to work bowling over linebackers and diminutive defensive backs.

In short yardage situations, he was versatile enough to rotate into the backfield as a fullback. For Minnesota, McDaniel controlled the line of scrimmage between 1988 and 1999. A near-lock for the Pro Bowl, he made 11 trips to the game as a Viking.

<h2>5. Alan Page</h2>
[caption id="attachment_769743" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-769743" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Vikings-logo-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Minnesota Vikings logo" width="757" height="452" /> The Minnesota Vikings logo | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

Alan Page was the focal point of a Purple People Eater defensive line that included fellow Hall of Famer Carl Eller, alongside Jim Marshall and Gary Larsen. The Purple People Eaters especially crushed opponents in cold weather games outside at Bloomington Metropolitan Stadium throughout the 1970s. Coach Bud Grant relied upon the toughness of this four-man front — in conjunction with the swirling winds, ice, and bitter temperatures — to get the psychological edge upon his opponents in Minnesota. As part of this unit, Alan Page made four trips to the Super Bowl.

To pressure the quarterback, Page would often loop around the line, in a stunt to confuse blockers, and in 1971 he <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PageAl00.htm" target="_blank">took home League MVP honors</a> as the face of a stingy defense that gave up a mere 9.9 points per game. As a Viking, Page made nine consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl, eventually serving on the Minnesota Supreme Court after retiring from the NFL.]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_709334" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709334" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Steelers-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="PITTSBURGH, PA - OCTOBER 09: Ben Roethlisberger #7 of the Pittsburgh Steelers throws a fourth quarter pass while playing the New York Jets at Heinz Field on October 9, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The NFL has a ton of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-4-past-uniforms-that-need-to-make-a-comeback.html/?a=viewall">classic throwback uniforms</a>.from Philadelphia's Kelly Green to the powder blue of the L.A. Chargers, the list goes on and on. One team that should stick to the present day? The Pittsburgh Steelers, who brought out their bumblebee-inspired threads for the first time since the 2014 NFL season. We hated them then, and we hate them now, even if the team seems to perform well while they're wearing them -- back in 2014 the Steelers went 51-34 for a victory over the Colts and stomped the Jets 31-13 this year.

A win's a win, but it's a fact that old school jerseys for any team can be tough on a typical human being’s retinas. Inspired by the Steelers’ threads, here are six horrendous NFL throwback jerseys that we would love to never see worn again. Entries are listed in no particular order, basically because there’s no way to rank which design is the most awful. Let’s just say we have a six-way tie.

<h2>1. Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_709342" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-709342" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Antonio-Brown-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="PITTSBURGH, PA - OCTOBER 09: Antonio Brown #84 of the Pittsburgh Steelers tries to pump up the fans prior to a fourth quarter punt return while playing the New York Jets at Heinz Field on October 9, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

This is a look best described as an angry bumblebee fresh out of, well, wherever it's acceptable to wear knee length tan shorts. A 311 concert? While the Black and Yellow is an integral part of the Steelers aesthetic, we're not fans of the retro embrace. At least they won, so the (visual) insult came without any sort of injury.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716788" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716788 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/76968818-640x432.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="511" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

The Eagles busted out these sky blue-and-yellow uniforms in 2007 and promptly scored a season-best 56 points against the Lions. Okay, on second thought, maybe the team <em>should</em> bring this ugly design back more often. At Chip Kelly’s tempo, the Eagles’ offense could probably hit triple digits wearing the retro unis.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716791" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716791 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/107376731-640x482.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="570" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

The Packers have never lost in their throwback uniforms, a look that hearkens back to the team’s early days as the <a href="http://www.packers.com/history/packers-uniform-history.html" target="_blank">Acme Packers</a>. (Really? Acme? Who knew? Wile. E. Coyote <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5361804/wile-e-coyote-acme-lawsuit-technical-drawings-pentagram" target="_blank">would be</a> proud.) Apparently having any two parts of the ensemble actually match colors just wouldn’t work, as the combination of the dark brown helmet, tan pants, and navy blue jersey with yellow logo is forever seared into our brains.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716793" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716793 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/107344082-640x436.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="516" /> J. Meric/Getty Images[/caption]

From <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/tam/" target="_blank">1976 to 1996</a>, or, as you might better know it, the “Creamsicle era,” the Buccaneers were 100-223-1. In other words, we have no idea why a franchise would possibly want to remind itself year after year about a 20-year stretch when it only won 30% of its games <em>and</em> wore the ugliest jerseys in the NFL. (The old-school Bucs were best summed up by coach John McKay back in the expansion days: <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/06/16/john-mckay-will-enter-bucs-ring-of-honor/" target="_blank">When asked</a> about his team’s execution, he said, “I’m in favor of it.”). Well … let’s just say that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tampa-bay-bucs-uniforms-photos-2014-3" target="_blank">beauty is in the eye of the beholder</a>.

<h2>5. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716795" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-716795 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/91755882-640x420.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="497" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

The helmets are dull. The tops are bad. The pants are an ugly brown color. But the socks! Oh, the socks! Apparently the Broncos’ old-school uniforms have the same issue as the Steelers': They didn’t properly understand the concept of stripes <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2164030/Yes-stripes-DO-make-look-fat-Unless-theyre-narrow-black-horizontal-Confused-Heres-make-work-you.html" target="_blank">being slimming</a>. Others’ assessments of the notorious and hideous Denver apparel were even more harsh than ours: <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2009/10/10/broncos-breaking-out-throwback-throw-up-unis/" target="_blank">Pro Football Talk</a> used the term “excrement brown” to describe these “throw-up unis.”

<h2>6. New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_716798" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="wp-image-716798 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/125628029-640x445.jpg" alt="" width="758" height="527" /> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Have you noticed how many of the worst NFL jerseys include some form of yellow or gold? Coincidence? You be the judge. The same is true of these New York Jets throwbacks, which pay homage to the jerseys worn by the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/sports/football/jets-step-into-the-past-with-their-uniforms.html" target="_blank">Titans of New York</a>” in the ’60s. While we hate the look, the design, and really everything about these uniforms, we also propose that the Jets should have to wear them every game at least for the rest of this season. After all, with the team on a seven-game losing streak, they’re going to look ugly no matter what they wear. Might as well get their money’s worth out of this old Titans gear.]]></content:encoded>

			<title>10 Greatest NFL Tight Ends of All­ Time</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="wp-image-679843" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Antonio-Gates_Stephen-Dunn_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="&quot;Tight" />

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> tight end has ultimately emerged as the Jack­ of ­all trades, the Renaissance man. Within <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-top-5-quarterbacks-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">increasingly complex passing schemes</a>, the most productive NFL tight ends motion out of formations, run crisp routes, and catch the football with the grace of a wide receiver. In recent times, Antonio Gates and Tony Gonzalez both worked to solidify their names atop the "greatest NFL tight ends of all time" list. In 2007, the Dallas Cowboys' Jason Witten defined tight end grit, with his 53­-yard, helmet­-less catch and romp in Philadelphia.

As receivers, elite tight ends are match­up nightmares. In single coverage, the greatest NFL tight ends are too big and strong for defensive backs, but also too fast for linebackers. At the line of scrimmage, the craftiest tight ends may also pass protect for one count, before settling into the soft zone to make a play and move the chains. Of course, old­-school sports buffs will point out that a good tight end also keys the ground game. The greatest NFL tight ends hold the edge at the point of attack and free up space for running backs to burst into the clear.

Many football diehards of the John Madden camp long for the days of jumbo packages, two to three tight end sets, three yards, and a cloud of dust. The best NFL tight ends of all­ time will smack you upside the head at third and inches, and then turn around and beat deep coverage on the very next play. Here's a look at the 10 individuals who played their way onto this list.

<h2>10. Ben Coates</h2>
[caption id="attachment_485115" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-485115" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/343492.jpg" alt="Ben Coates (L) looks to make a play | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="497" /> Ben Coates (L) looks to make a play | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

A late bloomer, Ben Coates completed his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CoatBe00.htm" target="_blank">10-year NFL career</a> with 499 total receptions, 5,555 receiving yards, and 50 touchdowns. Upon his retirement, Coates's reception totals placed him fourth on the all-­time tight end list. In 2004, Coates set a then-single­-season record with 96 catches at tight end. In retrospect, few NFL observers would have ever believed that a 1991 fifth-round draft pick out of Livingstone College would emerge as a perennial Pro Bowl tight end and all­-time great.

Coates opened up his career at New England with a pedestrian 30 catches for 266 yards­ in two years of action. In 1993, Coates joined forces with Drew Bledsoe and Bill Parcells in Foxborough, Mass. The Tuna, having groomed smash mouth Mark Bavaro as a Giant, quickly installed Coates as part of his winning game plan.

In response, the man they called "Winter" became the ultimate security blanket for a young Drew Bledsoe. At 6-foot-5 and­ 245 pounds, Coates relied on his big body to clear space in the short zone, shield linebackers, and rack up catches. In 2000, the twilight of his career, Coates walked away with a Super Bowl trophy­ with the Baltimore Ravens.

<h2>9. Antonio Gates</h2>
<img class="wp-image-610593" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Antonio-Gates_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x470.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" width="757" height="556" />

Antonio Gates is a product of the basketball­-player­-turned­-tight­-end movement. His career is that of storybook legend; he showed up at a San Diego tryout ­without ever playing a snap of football for Kent State. In camp, Gates put his basketball skills to work and impressed scouts with his ability to box out in space and battle for deep bombs.

On the field, Gates plays as an extra wide receiver and is often motioned out of the formation to match ­up against cornerbacks. For a tight end, Gates is about the big play. In <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GateAn00.htm" target="_blank">his 14-year career</a>, Gates has averaged 12.5 yards per reception and caught 109 touchdowns. At this point he has 883 receptions and a total of 11,032 yards receiving. Is it any wonder quarterback Philip Rivers likes having him around?<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Ozzie Newsome</h2>
[caption id="attachment_553929" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-553929" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ozzie-Newsome_DAVID-MAXWELL_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ozzie Newsome poses next to his Hall of Fame bust | David Maxwell/Getty Images" width="757" height="592" /> Ozzie Newsome is a Hall of Famer | David Maxwell/Getty Images[/caption]

After Paul Brown and Art Modell, Ozzie Newsome is arguably the greatest contributor to the Cleveland Browns/Baltimore Ravens organization. After performing as one of the all­-time great NFL tight ends, he is now one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-5-best-general-managers-in-the-nfl.html/">most revered general managers</a> in the game of football.

During a career spanning from 1978 until 1990, The Wizard of Oz rivaled Kellen Winslow for the title of greatest pass-catching tight end of his era. He retired atop the NFL tight ends' receptions list ­with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewsOz00.htm" target="_blank">662 catches</a>. From tight end, Newsome finished second in the league in receptions in 1983 and 1984 ­with 89 catches both years.

<h2>7. Todd Christensen</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vo9hDiZi-c"></iframe>

As a former star BYU running back, Todd Christensen may be described as the precursor to the NFL H­-back, or tight end/fullback hybrid. In the '80s, Joe Gibbs and his Hogs popularized the H­-back, ­with Terry Orr, Clint Didier, and ultimately Chris Cooley filling this role. For a versatile attack, an H-back may either appear in the backfield or at the line of scrimmage as a lead blocker or pass-­catching receiver.

For his career, Christensen parlayed his ability to make quick cuts into <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ChriTo00.htm" target="_blank">461 catches and 5,872 receiving yards</a>. In fact, he actually led the NFL in receptions in '83 and '86 with 92 and 95 catches respectively. He went to five straight Pro Bowls between 1983 and 1987, and he also won two Super Bowls. As an offbeat intellectual, Christensen was one of the many characters cast to don the Silver and Black.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Dave Casper</h2>
<img class="wp-image-701891" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51682074-586x500.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Dave "The Ghost" Casper is best known for his quirky sideline antics and masked grin as an Oakland Raider. Behind his smiles, however, Casper served as a devastating blocker within the run-oriented schemes of Oakland and Houston. In terms of physicality, the former Notre Dame offensive tackle rivals Mark Bavaro for the belt as the game's greatest goon at tight end.

As a pass protector, Casper often dominated larger defensive ends and outside linebackers. In the running game, Casper plowed holes for the likes of both Mark van Eeghen and Earl Campbell at the point of attack. Beyond punishing defenses at the line, Casper also found time to get open. In the Raiders' vertical offense, Casper often worked the intermediate routes on curl and seam patterns. Casper finished his 11-year Hall of Fame career <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CaspDa00.htm" target="_blank">with 378 catches, 5,216 receiving yards</a>, and two Super Bowl rings.

<h2>5. Kellen Winslow</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZbSh1ZfR1c"></iframe>

One of the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-top-ten/09000d5d810a691f/Top-10-Gutsiest-Performances-Kellen-Winslow" target="_blank">most memorable scenes in all of sports</a>: when Kellen Winslow's teammates carried him off the field in Miami. In "The Epic in Miami," he turned in one of the greatest individual performances of all time, with 13 catches, 166 yards receiving, and one blocked field goal for a 41­-38 San Diego win over Miami.

Winslow revolutionized the modern passing game, as a member of the Air Coryell attack in San Diego. These '80s San Diego clubs featured a trio of Hall of Famers who teamed together Dan Fouts and Charlie Joiner alongside Winslow. In 1980, Winslow put together the greatest statistical season of all­ time for NFL tight ends when he amassed 89 catches for 1,290 yards.

At 6-foot-5 and 251 pounds, Winslow used his long strides to consistently burn opposing defenses for big plays. Still, his body of work is somewhat marred by a lack of Super Bowl titles and prime longevity. In 1987, at 30 years old, Winslow retired with a total of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WinsKe00.htm" target="_blank">541 catches and 6,741 receiving yards</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Shannon Sharpe</h2>
<img class="wp-image-701848" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51634276.jpg" alt="&quot;&lt;yoastmark" />

Shannon Sharpe was one of the few NFL athletes who could match big talk with big game. As a backdrop to his intense motor and smack talk, Sharpe also represents one of the greatest NFL rags­-to-riches stories of all time. According to Sharpe, on his Georgia upbringing, "We were so poor, a robber once broke into our house and we ended up robbing the robber."

In 1990, the Denver Broncos drafted Sharpe in the seventh round as a wide receiver. Shortly thereafter, coach Dan Reeves moved Sharpe over to tight end to serve as another weapon for John Elway. Through his insatiable hunger and work ethic, Sharpe steadily improved into the complete package of size and strength at the position.

His <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SharSh00.htm" target="_blank">14-year totals</a> of 815 catches for 10,060 yards and 62 touchdowns compare favorably to any man who has ever caught a football. As a winner, Sharpe laid claim to three Lombardi trophies after winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos and one title with the Baltimore Ravens.

In 2013, Tony Gonzalez hung up his NFL cleats as the owner of every significant record applicable to NFL tight ends. He closed out his 17-­year career having taken down 1,325 receptions <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GonzTo00.htm" target="_blank">for 15,127 yards and 111 touchdowns</a>. These numbers include individual seasons of 93, 102, 99, and 96 catches in 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2008, respectively.

In 2004, Gonzalez actually led the NFL in catches ­with 102 receptions for 1,258 yards as a member of the Kansas City Chiefs. His numbers, longevity, and consistency shaped him in the mold of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/peyton-manning/" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a>. Yes, Gonzalez had been so good for so long that his production became somewhat boring.

Despite operating as the focal point of defensive game plans, Gonzalez seemed to always be open ­through a combination of head fakes, feints, and shifts. Once open, he had the softest hands in the business, snagging anything thrown his way. He was also a willing blocker, despite his reputation as a finesse player. At tight end, Gonzalez would throw his weight around to pave the way for 1,000-­yard rushers in Priest Holmes, Larry Johnson, and Michael Turner.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Mike Ditka</h2>
<img class="wp-image-701898" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51634083.jpg" alt="&quot;Former" />

Mike Ditka means football. Before he was "Da Coach," Iron Mike simply ran over and through people for the Chicago Bears as a crew cut kid from Pennsylvania. Ditka changed the tight end game, proving that he could both maul people at the line of scrimmage and also emerge as a viable threat within the passing game.

As a rookie in 1961, Ditka hauled in 56 passes for 1,076 yards and 12 touchdowns over the course of a 14-­game regular season. For his career, Ditka caught 427 balls <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DitkMi00.htm" target="_blank">for 5,812 yards and 43 touchdowns</a>. In comparison, these numbers look pedestrian against today's high­-powered offenses. As a basis of comparison, Ditka finished as a top­-10 NFL pass catcher for four straight years between 1961 and 1964. This production is unprecedented for a tight end of any era.

<h2>1. John Mackey</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gL2gGdc6vQQ"></iframe>

Between 1963 and 1972, John Mackey added an element of speed to the Ditka formula of raw toughness. In fact, Mackey actually put in spot duty on special teams for the Baltimore Colts ­as a kick returner. A man among boys, Mackey destroyed the competition for 331 catches, 5,236 yards, and 38 touchdowns during his 10-­year career.

Perhaps most impressively was the fact that Mackey <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MackJo00.htm" target="_blank">averaged 15.8 yards per catch</a>, which would still trump the statistics of many speedster wide receivers. On November 20, 1966, Mackey caught a five-­yard-out pass in the flat. From there, vintage Mackey turned up field to juke, spin around, ran over, and glide past eight different Detroit Lions ­en route to a 64-­yard touchdown completion. The NFL Network defines this sequence as "the number one play in NFL history."

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_554262" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-554262 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Letroy-Guion-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="757" height="560" /> Green Bay Packers celebrate a victory. | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

You can't blame teams, players, and organizations for thinking ahead to what it's going to take to bring home a Super Bowl title. That's just the way it is. And while the game has become very offense-minded over the last decade with high-octane running and passing attacks, there’s still validity in the saying, “Offense wins games. Defense wins championships.”

The squad with the most balance is the one that usually comes out victorious. Throughout <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> history there have been plenty of defensive units that wreaked havoc on opposing quarterbacks, essentially winning titles for their teams. However, as far as we're concerned, only these seven particular groups managed to revolutionized the game.

<h2>7. 1960s Green Bay Packers</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPCDCoSD-Sg"></iframe>

Legendary head coach Vince Lombardi led one of the most intimidating defensive units in NFL history in the 1960s. In a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/1962.htm" target="_blank">dominant 1962 season</a>, the team yielded just 10.8 points per game, shut out three opponents, and limited opposing quarterbacks to a 43.5 rating. It had five Hall of Famers in defensive linemen Willie Davis and Henry Jordan, linebacker Ray Nitschke, cornerback Herb Adderley, and safety Willie Wood. The Packers defense of the ’60s won five championships, including the first two Super Bowls.

<h2>6. 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>

In 2002, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers did major damage to NFL offenses, led by Hall of Famer Warren Sapp and all-pros Derrick Brooks, John Lynch, and Ronde Barber. The Bucs became the second team to ever lead the NFL in total defense, points allowed, and interceptions. With a 12-4 record, the team annihilated the Oakland Raiders in Superbowl XXXVII by a score of 48-21. Safety Dexter Jackson was the MVP. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/tam/2002.htm" target="_blank">Throughout the ’02 season</a>, Tampa Bay held its opponent to 10 points or fewer nine times.

<h2>5. The Big Blue Wrecking Crew (New York Giants, '85-90)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHC15HYwJ5Q"></iframe>
Between 1985 and 1990, the New York Giants’ defensive unit was known as the “Big Blue Wrecking Crew,” headed by Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson. In the midst of their success, the Giants added all-pro defensive end Leornard Marshall, making the unit one of the most feared in NFL history. Coached by the legendary Bill Parcells, the Giants won two championships in that time span: <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nyg/1986.htm" target="_blank">Superbowl XXI in 1986</a> and XXV in 1990. The defensive coordinator was Bill Belichick, who would eventually go on to coach the New England Patriots to three Super Bowl titles in four years during the 2000s.

<h2>4. 2000 Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_532420" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-532420 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Baltimore-Ravens-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="515" /> Baltimore Ravens take the field. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

In the year 2000, the Baltimore Ravens put themselves on the map with a defense that included arguably two of the greatest players of all time at their positions: linebacker Ray Lewis and cornerback Rod Woodson. Despite a poor offense, this group, coached by Brian Billick and defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, still managed to finish the season with a 12-4 record. The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/2000.htm" target="_blank">Ravens did not allow an offensive TD in Super Bowl XXXV</a>, when they beat the explosive New York Giants, 34-7. Lewis was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year after recording 3.5 sacks, 137 tackles, and 2 interceptions.

<h2>3. The Purple People Eaters (Minnesota Vikings, '60s-'70s)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XodzlKMkuZM"></iframe>
Making reference to a 1958 pop song by Sheb Wooley, the defensive line of the Minnesota Vikings from the late 1960s to the late 1970s was called the “Purple People Eaters.” With nine-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Alan Page and six-time Pro Bowl defensive end Carl Eller among several others, the Vikes came up short on four trips to the championship game in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX, and XI. The unit’s best season was in 1971, when Page won league MVP and the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/min/1971.htm" target="_blank">team only gave up an average of 9.9 points per game</a>, holding quarterbacks to a 40.4 efficiency rating. With opposing passers running for their lives all season, the People Eaters’ motto was simple: “Meet at the quarterback.”

<h2>2. 1985 Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_532424" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-532424 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chicago-Bears-Defense-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="519" /> Chicago Bears celebrate a turnover. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan’s 46 scheme led the Chicago Bears of the mid 1980s to a Super Bowl championship in 1985. Featuring Hall of Fame linebacker Mike Singletary and defensive end Dan Hampton, they also had all-pros Steve McMichael, Richard Dent, Otis Wilson, Dave Duerson and Wilber Marshall. The group was given the name “Monsters of the Midway” because of its blitz-happy scheme that aimed to obliterate opposing quarterbacks. With head coach Mike Ditka at the helm, “Da Bears” finished the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1985.htm" target="_blank">'85 regular season with a 15-1 mark</a> and are considered by many to be the best single-season defense of all time.

<h2>1. The Steel Curtain (Pittsburgh Steelers, '70s)</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLcJkiFh5ec"></iframe>
The most ferocious, intimidating, and dominant defense in NFL history belongs to the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s, otherwise known as the “Steel Curtain.” With <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/" target="_blank">victories in Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV</a>, the Steelers were unstoppable, and nobody wanted to face them. Between 1973 and 1978, opposing quarterbacks had a pitiful 45 passer rating. The squad was lead by “Mean” Joe Greene, J.C. Greenwood, Dwight White, Ernie Holmes, and Jack Lambert. After a 1-4 start in 1976, the Steelers gave up only 28 points in the final nine games. Eight defensive players wound up making the Pro Bowl that season.

		<description><![CDATA[The greatest NFL safeties of all time always made their presences felt out on the gridiron, doing their best to put offensive coordinators out of work.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_743930" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743930 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ed-Reed-Rob-Carr-Getty-images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> The now-retired Ed Reed provided veteran leadership from the safety position | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL safeties are the the last line of defense,  enforcers who deliver punishment, force turnovers, and are charged with preventing the big play. At defensive back, every snap is a do or die scenario, where the safety man can either jump what appears to be a swing pass out in the flat for a loss, or get burnt deep on a wheel route for a 65-yard touch down.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-greatest-nfl-players-of-all-%c2%adtime.html/" target="_blank">all time greats</a> trusted their instincts to wreak havoc, trash opposing game plans, and put offensive coordinators out of work. In run support, elite safeties would chomp at the bit to go eight in the box, take on pulling guards, and destroy the ball carrier at the point of attack. These run stoppers didn’t mind getting down and dirty, and would often crash into the pile to deliver a timely forearm shiver, just before the whistle blew. In pass coverage, the greats patrolled the defensive backfield as center fielders that could either take an interception back to the house, or lay the smack down upon lightweight wide receivers. The greatest NFL safeties of all time always made their presences felt out on the gridiron.

<h2>10. Yale Lary</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743866" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743866 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lions-Helmet-Tom-Pidgeon-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="531" /> Tom Pidgeon/Getty Images[/caption]

In Detroit, Yale Lary anchored the greatest NFL secondary of all time. The 1960s Detroit Lions’ defensive backfield featured Lary alongside fellow Hall of Famers Dick “Night Train" Lane and Dick LeBeau. In coverage, Lary was a force, as he snagged 50 interceptions <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LaryYa00.htm" target="_blank">during his 13-year career</a>. Interestingly, Lary was also a skilled special teams player, who returned kicks and will also go down as one of the game’s greatest punters. Lary actually led the League in punting on three separate occasions — in 1959, 1961, and 1963. In 1963, Lary boomed kicks for a 49-yard per punt average. As a Detroit Lions’ stalwart, Yale Lary was to appear in nine Pro Bowls — between 1953 and 1964.

<h2>9. Willie Wood</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743869" align="aligncenter" width="759"]<img class="wp-image-743869 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lambeau-Field-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="759" height="505" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

At free safety, Willie Wood was the last line of defense behind the likes of fellow Hall of Famers Ray Nitschke, Herb Adderley, Willie Davis, and Henry Jordan on the Frozen Tundra. As a leader of this defensive unit, Wood was to win five NFL championships between 1961 and 1967. In terms of Green Bay mystique, Wood is best remembered for his Super Bowl I 50-yard interception run back against the Kansas City Chiefs. Wood’s pick changed the game and converted a 14-10 nip and tuck battle into a 35-10 Green Bay rout over the AFL Chiefs. Wood hung up his cleats in 1971, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoodWi00.htm" target="_blank">after hauling in 48 interceptions and making eight trips to the Pro Bowl</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Steve Atwater</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743871" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-743871 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Steve-Atwater-Jeff-Haynes-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="587" /> Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Steve Atwater was the greatest run-support safety of all time. Atwater effectively performed as the fifth linebacker, in Denver’s 3-4 defense. As a tackling machine, Atwater <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AtwaSt00.htm" target="_blank">compiled more than 120 tackles during his first five NFL seasons</a>. In his 1990 sophomore season, Atwater tallied an all-around 173 tackles, two forced fumbles, two interceptions, and one sack. As a winner, Atwater captained the 1998 Denver Broncos defense that witnessed a gritty John Elway go helicopter-airborne for first down yardage and a Super Bowl championship.

At a rangy 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds of muscle, Atwater laid the wood in the Mile High City. Atwater simply had no regard for human life and will forever be a staple of devastating hit highlight reels. In pass coverage, vintage Atwater often arrived with the football, before lifting a receiver off his feet and driving him into the ground, as if he were a ragdoll.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Emlen Tunnell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743887 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Giants-logo-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="493" /> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Emlen Tunnell was professional football’s original ball-hawk and the self-proclaimed “first black everything." In 1948, Tunnell broke the color barrier for the New York Giants. From there, Tunnell went on to become the first African American player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, in 1967.

<a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=217" target="_blank">According the Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, Tunnell dropped back as the “strut" in New York’s umbrella defenses. For modern-era fans, Tunnell effectively played the safety role in a dime defense. Nicknamed “offense on defense," Tunnell retired with a then record 79 interceptions (now 2nd of all-time), for 1,282 return yards and 4 touchdowns, in 14 years with the New York Giants and Green Bay Packers. As an all-around athlete, Tunnell also led the NFL in punt return yardage in 1951 and 1952.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Larry Wilson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743894" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-743894 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cardinals-logo-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="514" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Historically, Larry Wilson labored in relative obscurity for the moribund St. Louis Cardinals [editor’s note: not to be confused with the MLB team of the same name, the St. Louis Cardinals are now based in Arizona] franchise. Wilson was credited for his perfection of the safety blitz, where he would time his approach to the line of scrimmage alongside the snap count and simply tee off upon the opposing quarterback. In coverage, Wilson was also a force to be reckoned with throughout his 13-year career. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WilsLa00.htm" target="_blank">In 1966</a>, Wilson snagged 10 interceptions for 180 return yards and two touchdowns.

Certainly, Wilson never dreamed of a Hall of Fame career, as a 1960 seventh round pick out of the University of Utah. In training camp, Wilson was a disaster on the offensive side of the ball and at cornerback. Larry Wilson, of course, impressed his coaches when he would crash down into the pocket on the safety blitz to take his shots. With the safety blitz, a star was born.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Troy Polamalu</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743897" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743897 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Troy-Polomalu-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

Troy Polamalu is one of the most distinguished athletes to ever suit up and strap on a pair of shoulder pads. Contrary to his looks and soft-spoken demeanor, Troy Polamalu was a force. With a $1 million insurance policy on his flowing locks, Polamalu flew all over the field to run amok, rack up tackles, snatch interceptions, and inflict punishing hits.

As Superman, Polamalu was likely to go airborne at the line of scrimmage and drag down the opposing running back on fourth and inches. This former USC standout has mastered the art of the strip sack, where he times his blitz release perfectly, dips his shoulder past a lumbering tackle on the edge, and karate chops the football out of the quarterback’s hands from the blind side. Next, Polamalu is on the move for Steeler Nation, as he scoops the football off the grass and weaves in and out of traffic toward the end zone.

<h2>4. Ed Reed</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743907" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743907 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ed-Reed-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

On defense, Ed Reed was a playmaker that thought six on every possession. In Baltimore, Reed teamed up with Ray Lewis, the self-proclaimed God’s linebacker, to dominate the middle of the gridiron and win two Super Bowl titles. At free safety, Reed had mastered the art of the bait and switch to snag 64 interceptions <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/ReedEd00.htm" target="_blank">during his 12-year career</a>. In fact, Reed’s single-season interception totals have led the NFL on three separate occasions.

Vintage Reed hung back in the secondary after the snap, as if he were somewhat out of the action. At that point, the opposing quarterback would test Reed deep and let the ball fly on a post pattern. Immediately, Reed would be on the move to cover large tracts of turf and jump the route for a perfectly timed pick. From here, his Baltimore Ravens teammates would transition into offense — with Reed safely high-stepping behind a convoy of goons into the clear for six.

<h2>3. Paul Krause</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743911" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743911 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Paul-Krause-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="493" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Paul Krause served as the ultimate backstop for the 1970s Purple People Eaters at Minnesota. Nicknamed Centerfielder, Krause went on to snag 81 interceptions and break Emlen Tunnell’s longstanding record (79). Remarkably, the Centerfielder only missed two games over the course of his 16-year career.

As a Washington Redskins rookie, Krause battled his way into the starting lineup and made an immediate impact. During his first-year 1964 campaign, Paul Krause emerged as the NFL leader, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KrauPa00.htm" target="_blank">with 12 interceptions</a>. Although the Centerfielder took the League by storm in Washington, he was later traded to the Minnesota Vikings for a virtual pu pu platter of Marlin McKeever and one seventh round draft pick. Certainly, Krause was to have the last laugh, as he went on to appear in four Super Bowls and six Pro Bowls (8 total with Redskins and Vikings) at Minnesota.

<h2>2.  Ken Houston</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743918" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743918 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Oilers-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="510" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Ken Houston was the total package at safety. As a tackler, the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Houston always dealt a stinging blow at the point of attack. In pass coverage, this ball hawk often appeared at the right time and at the right place, as he racked up 49 interceptions during his 14-year career <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HousKe02.htm" target="_blank">with the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers</a>. Ken Houston simply had a nose for the ball — and the end zone.

Houston’s 1971 record of five touchdown returns (four interceptions and one touchdown) was to stand for 35 years, before the ridiculous Devin Hester was to take six kickoff and punt returns back to the house in 2006. As an all-around performer, Ken Houston was to close out his career having recovered 21 fumbles and scoring 12 touchdowns. Houston scored upon 9 interceptions, alongside one punt return, one fumble recovery, and one blocked field goal.

<h2>1. Ronnie Lott</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743920" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-743920 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ronnie-Lott-Andrew-H.-Walker-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="496" /> Andrew H. Walker, Getty Images[/caption]

Ronnie Lott was the greatest defensive back of all time. For the love of the game, Lott had the tip of his pinky finger amputated, so that he could make plays. Immediately after having the top of his finger sawed off, a reinvigorated Lott was right back out there to throttle people, rush the quarterback, and drop back into coverage to break up passes. On top of his toughness, Lott will always be celebrated for his otherworldly ability to anticipate, diagnose, and blow up offensive schemes through raw instinct.

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LottRo00.htm" target="_blank">At corner and both safety positions</a>, Lott tallied 63 interceptions, 5 touchdowns, and 17 fumble recoveries for the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Raiders, and New York Jets. Lott, of course, will always be remembered as a San Francisco Treat — with four Super Bowl trophies to go alongside his highlight reel of vicious hits across the middle. Wide receivers often went full alligator-arm before entering Lott’s zone, only to still see stars as they got knocked into the end of next week. No. 42 brought the pain.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_719170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Adam-Glanzman_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Brock Osweiler waves at the crowd." width="757" height="505" /> The Houston Texans dumped Brock Osweiler. | Adam Glanzman/Getty Images[/caption]

Football fans can always count on seeing multiple <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/underpaid-nfl-players-deserve-pay-raise.html/" target="_blank">big-name players</a> change teams <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-worst-free-agency-contracts-of-the-2016-offseason.html/" target="_blank">every offseason</a> in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>. This year, among others, we have already seen guys like defensive end Calais Campbell, cornerbacks A.J. Buoye and Stephon Gilmore, and wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson all take <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-potential-landing-spots-for-adrian-peterson.html/" target="_blank">their talents to new franchises</a> during the first few hours of the new league year.

A lot will likely happen over the next couple of months that will shape the 2017 NFL season. There will be trades, retirements, veteran players getting released in cost-cutting moves, and of course, the 2017 NFL Draft. Once teams have a better idea as to what they need to do to strengthen their rosters after the initial wave of free agency, the wheeling and dealing will begin. Here is a look at 25 big-name players who we believe could still change teams in 2017.

<h2>1. Adrian Peterson, RB, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675734" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675734" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adrian-Peterson_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Adrian Peterson could be playing his last season as a Minnesota Viking in 2016. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Adrian Peterson has spent his entire 10-year NFL career with the Vikings. Over that span the former Oklahoma Sooner has put together a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/adrian-peterson-career-stats.html/">Hall of Fame-caliber resume</a>. He's rushed for a 11,725 yards and 97 touchdowns on 2,412 carries, caught 240 passes for 1,944 yards and five touchdowns, been selected to seven Pro Bowls and seven All-Pro teams, won the 2007 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award and the 2012 NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year awards, and he has led the league in rushing yards three times and rushing touchdowns twice.

Despite his immense success, the Vikings declined to pick up his roster option earlier this offseason. At this point in time, Peterson has been <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/you-wont-believe-where-vegas-thinks-adrian-peterson-will-play-2017.html/" target="_blank">linked to several teams</a> -- most notably the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-potential-landing-spots-for-adrian-peterson.html/">Seattle Seahawks</a>, Oakland Raiders, Green Bay Packers, and New England Patriots.

<h2>2. Dont'a Hightower, linebacker, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_749035" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749035" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Donta-Hightower_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1024x814.jpg" alt="FOXBORO, MA - AUGUST 20: Dont'a Hightower #45 of the New England Patriots watches the action from the sidelines against the Philadelphia Eagles during a preseason game at Gillette Stadium on August 20, 2012 in Foxboro, Massachusetts. (Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)" width="757" height="602" /> The Pats surprisingly decided to let Dont'a Hightower test the market. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

It looks like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-the-highest-paid-players-in-super-bowl-51.html/">Dont'a Hightower</a> will soon join the lengthy list of big-name players <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-bill-belichick-sent-packing.html/" target="_blank">who Bill Belichick has sent packing</a>. The 26-year-old linebacker earned All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors and made several key plays during the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-best-nfl-players-in-super-bowl-51.html/">Patriots' Super Bowl 51 win</a> (he was a member of their Super Bowl XLIX-winning team as well), which makes Belichick's decision to not use their franchise tag or attempt to re-sign Hightower a real head-scratcher. Look for the former Alabama standout to land one of the richest contracts for a linebacker in NFL history this offseason.

<h2>3. Brandin Cooks, WR, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_564247" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-564247 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Brandin-Cooks_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Brandin Cooks is unhappy with his role in the Saints' offense. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

As of now, it looks like Brandin Cooks has played his last down of football for the Saints. The former Oregon State Beaver grew increasingly frustrated with his role in the New Orleans offense during the 2016 season, and appears to have made himself expendable for the Saints. New Orleans has fielded multiple trade offers, and it seems like only a matter of time until Cooks has a new employer.

<h2>4. Tony Romo, QB, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_726730" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-726730" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tony-Romo-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images-1024x717.jpg" alt="Tony Romo puts the Dallas Cowboys first | Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="800" height="560" /> Tony Romo lost his job to Dak Prescott. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

At this point, the fact that Tony Romo, who has already said farewell to Dallas <a href="http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2017/03/07/tony-romo-kids-strike-another-adorable-instagram-moment" target="_blank">via social media</a>, will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-tony-romo-landing-spots.html/" target="_blank">change teams in 2017</a> isn't really new news. The 36-year-old quarterback's playing future has been by far the biggest story of the 2017 offseason, and it appears as though he will eventually land with the Denver Broncos or Houston Texans.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Martellus Bennett, TE, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748238" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-748238" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Martellus-Bennett-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Martellus Bennett is done in New England. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Heading into the offseason it seemed like a forgone conclusion that Martellus Bennett would land a contract extension that would keep him in New England for the foreseeable future. Instead, Bill Belichick swung a trade with the Indianapolis Colts for another tight end, Dwayne Allen, which essentially ended Bennett's tenure with the Patriots after only one season. Expect to see Bennett land a hefty contract with another Super Bowl contender.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Colin Kaepernick, QB, San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621228" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Colin-Kaepernick_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Colin Kaepernick will likely be wearing a new uniform in 2016. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers have officially parted ways less than five years after the former Nevada standout quarterbacked them to an NFC title. Thanks in large part to his distracting behavior off the field, it's currently unclear how much of a market there will be for Kaepernick this offseason. When it's all said and done, though, we expect the 29-year-old to land a job somewhere as a backup.

<h2>7. Jay Cutler, QB, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_670499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-670499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jay-Cutler_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1024x725.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="536" /> We have likely seen the last of Jay Cutler in a Chicago Bears uniform. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The Bears ended months of speculation and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/wont-believe-vegas-thinks-jay-cutler-will-play-2017.html/">released Jay Cutler</a> shortly after the 2017 league year officially opened. He may be one of the most disappointing players in league history, but given his immense talent, Cutler should <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jay-cutler-potential-landing-spots.html/">find a new NFL home</a> in the near future.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Jamaal Charles, RB, Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_570283" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-570283" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jamaal-Charles-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images-1024x642.jpg" alt="Jamaal-Charles-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="475" /> Jamaal Charles is going to be a salary cap casualty. | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Chiefs cut Jamaal Charles earlier this offseason in what amounted to a cost-cutting move. Would the team have preferred to have the former Texas Longhorn finish his career in Kansas City? Probably. But the fact of the matter is Charles had a large salary cap number and has only played in eight games over the last two seasons.

Charles is reportedly nearing full strength, and is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-potential-landing-spots-for-jamaal-charles.html/" target="_blank">looking to continue his career</a> in 2017. With as explosive as he was during the prime of his career, the 30-year-old running back shouldn't have a hard time finding work this offseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Victor Cruz, WR, New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735962" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735962" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Victor-Cruz_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Victor Cruz will likely be wearing a new uniform next year. | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

With the emergence of Sterling Shepard, Victor Cruz’s role in the Giants offense continued to diminish in 2016. And then when you factor in his injury history combined with his scheduled salary cap hit of $9.4 million in 2017, it's easy to see why the Giants chose to cut the 2011 second-team All-Pro after six seasons.

Cruz has made it clear that he wants to continue playing, and will likely be able to latch on with another team in need of a veteran wide receiver in 2017.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Jason Peters, OT, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_544276" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-544276 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jason-Peters_Al-Bello_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Al Bello/Getty Images" width="757" height="975" /> Salary cap concerns could result in the Philadelphia Eagles parting ways with Jason Peters. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

The Eagles were unable to restructure Jason Peters' contract this offseason, but still chose to keep the six-time All-Pro in the fold going forward. While he will likely still play for Philadelphia in 2017, some teams around the league (the Denver Broncos immediately come to mind may be willing to make the Eagles a trade offer they simply cannot refuse.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>11. Sheldon Richardson, DE, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675751" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675751" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sheldon-Richardson_Elsa_Getty-Images-1024x676.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="500" /> The New York Jets may not have enough salary cap space to hold onto Sheldon Richardson. | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

If you look closely at what's going on with the Jets, it quickly becomes clear that trading Richardson makes a lot of sense. They already have depth at defensive end (Muhammad Wilkerson and Leonard Williams), and rather than forking over a huge second contract to Sheldon Richardson, who has had issues off the field, they could shop the 26-year-old and likely land a valuable draft pick, which would help expedite their rebuilding project.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>12. Vincent Jackson, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_689852" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-689852" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Vincent-Jackson-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Vincent Jackson is still making top dollar | Chris Graythen/Getty Images)" width="757" height="505" /> Vincent Jackson could be wearing a new uniform in 2016. | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

Vincent Jackson’s NFL future holds quite a bit of uncertainty. The 12-year veteran is currently an unrestricted free agent, and will be 34 years old when the 2017 season kicks off. Jackson has <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/18836620/vincent-jackson-tampa-bay-buccaneers-no-plans-retire" target="_blank">made it clear</a> that he wants to continue playing in 2017, but he will have to accept a role as a No. 2 or No. 3 wide receiver and a contract that is slightly above the league minimum.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>13. Mario Williams, DE, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735958" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mario-Williams_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images-1024x680.jpg" alt="Mario Williams won't be with the Miami Dolphins for much longer | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Mario Williams won't be with the Miami Dolphins for much longer. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

To put it mildly, the Dolphins' decision to add Mario Williams last offseason didn't exactly pan out. The 31-year-old defensive end has registered just 1.5 sacks and 13 total tackles in 13 games, and at times has looked completed unfocused and uninterested in playing football. The Dolphins recently cut Williams, and we expect him to land with a team that needs pass-rush help on an incentive-heavy contract.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>14. Darrelle Revis, CB, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_667472" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-667472" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Darrelle-Revis_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-2-1024x628.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="464" /> Darrelle Revis has clearly lost a step. | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Watching Darrelle Revis play in 2016 was sad. We (along with most football fans) had grown accustomed to seeing the 31-year-old shutting down the game’s best wide receivers, and essentially taking away half of the field for opposing offenses on a weekly basis. In 2016, Revis was a liability. The Jets <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-contracts-today.html/">released Revis</a> this offseason. If he can get his ongoing legal issues under control, he will likely land a job with another franchise if he is willing to move inside to safety.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>15. Josh Gordon, WR, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_549068" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-549068 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Josh-Gordon_Scott-Cunningham_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scott Cunningham/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Josh Gordon is done with the Cleveland Browns. | Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

When Josh Gordon checked himself into an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/suspended-nfl-players-2016-season.html/">inpatient rehab facility</a> in late September, he essentially ended his career with the Cleveland Browns. The 25-year-old wide receiver still has to be fully reinstated by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell before he can return to action. If he gets cleared to play, Gordon will surely receive a substantial amount of interest on the open market given his immense talent.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>16. Joe Haden, CB, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_551424" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-551424 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Joe-Haden_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Joe Haden could be on the move this offseason. | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

As evident by their pitiful 2016 record, the Browns are currently in full-fledged rebuilding mode. Knowing that their new front office places a high value on draft picks, we see the Browns trading Joe Haden, who, by the way, was rumored to be on the move as the 2016 trade deadline approached, to a contender this offseason in an effort to continue stockpiling valuable draft choices.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>17. Jonathan Stewart, RB, Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_575235" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-575235" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jonathan-Stewart_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Carolina Panthers could move on from Jonathan Stewart this offseason. | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

With every passing week in 2016, it appeared more and more like Jonathan Stewart hit the dreaded 30-year-old running back wall. He has once again been battling multiple nagging injuries in 2016. As a direct result, his production hasn’t exactly matched up with his contract. We expect the Panthers to release Stewart this offseason (probably around June 1), which would free him up to finish his career with another franchise.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>18. Joe Thomas, OT, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661205" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661205" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Thomas_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x686.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="507" /> Joe Thomas deserves to play for a winner. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

In our eyes, Joe Thomas deserves the chance to finish his Hall of Fame career playing for a team that has a chance to contend for a Super Bowl title. He was almost dealt to the Denver Broncos back in 2015, and his name came up again around the trade deadline this year. While Thomas has never publicly asked to be dealt, he simply cannot be enjoying what’s currently going on in Cleveland.

It does bear pointing out that the Browns have already spent big money on their offensive line, so they may no longer be willing to move Thomas. But at the end of the day, it’s time for the Browns to reward Thomas for his loyalty and consistency by sending him to a contender.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>19. Jimmy Garoppolo, QB, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663453" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663453" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jimmy-Garoppolo_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images-1-1024x708.jpg" alt="Maddie Meyer/Getty Images" width="757" height="523" /> Jimmy Garoppolo's stock is high. | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Anyone who follows the NFL knows that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">New England</a> head coach Bill Belichick <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-the-new-england-patriots-paid-the-best-team-in-the-nfl.html/">is a master</a> when it comes to making well-timed personnel moves. While Belichick would undoubtedly like to hold on to Jimmy Garoppolo as Tom Brady’s backup, the former Eastern Illinois quarterback’s stock may never get any higher than it is right now.

Garoppolo played extremely well during his two starts in place of Brady to open the season, and he still has one year left on his rookie contract. Given how desperate some teams are to improve at the quarterback position, the Pats could conceivably <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-potential-landing-spots-for-jimmy-garoppolo-in-2017.html/">trade the young signal caller</a> in exchange for multiple draft picks.

<h2>20. Ryan Clady, OT, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735967" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-735967" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ryan-Clady_Al-Bello_Getty-Images-781x1024.jpg" alt="Al Bello/Getty Images" width="500" height="655" /> Ryan Clady will have a short stay with the Jets. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

With Ryan Clady’s injury history (he finished the 2016 season on Injured Reserve), mediocre performance, and hefty 2017 salary cap number, it’s easy to see why the Jets cut ties with the four-time All-Pro this offseason. However, based on the remote possibility that he could potentially regain his once-dominant form, Clady will likely find another job if he can prove that he’s healthy.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>21. Dontari Poe, DT, Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743296" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dontari-Poe_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x700.jpg" width="757" height="517" /> The Chiefs don't have the cap space to keep Dontari Poe. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put: The Chiefs cannot afford to keep Dontari Poe in the mix. They wisely locked up All-Pro safety Eric Berry, and now Kansas City has to deal with the fact that Poe, a 2013 second-team All-Pro, will continue his career elsewhere. Given his versatility and freakish physical skill set, the 26-year-old defensive tackle should land a massive contract during free agency.

<h2>22. Terrelle Pryor, WR, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703104" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703104" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Terrelle-Pryor_Eric-Espada_Getty-Images-1024x825.jpg" width="757" height="610" /> Terrelle Pryor was one of the few bright spots for the Cleveland Browns in 2016. | Eric Espada/Getty Images[/caption]

There may not be a free agent out there with as much potential as Terrelle Pryor. In his first full season as a wide receiver, the former Ohio State quarterback looked unstoppable at times, and has the makings of a future perennial Pro Bowl wideout. Thanks to a lowball offer from the Browns, it looks as though Pryor will take his talents to a new city in 2017.

<h2>23. Eddie Lacy, RB, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644456" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644456" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Eddie-Lacy_Stacy-Revere_Getty-Images-1024x710.jpg" width="757" height="525" /> Eddie Lacy still has some gas left in his tank. | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

After an up and down four-year tenure with the Packers, it looks like Eddie Lacy is set to move on to another franchise. The 26-year-old tailback is a dominant runner when he's healthy and in shape, which hasn't been often during the last two seasons. The former Alabama standout has <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/03/09/eddie-lacys-free-agent-tour-includes-visit-to-packers/" target="_blank">already arranged visits</a> with the Seattle Seahawks and Minnesota Vikings, but has not completely ruled out a return to Green Bay.

<h2>24. Nick Mangold, C, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_507321" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-507321" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nick-Mangold1.jpg" width="757" height="1087" /> Nick Mangold is done with the Jets. | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Nick Mangold was one of several casualties of the Jets' 2017 offseason youth movement. The seven-time Pro Bowler (and likely future Hall of Famer) battled injuries in 2016, but still has enough left in the tank to help solidify another team's offensive line.

<h2>25. Chris Long, DE, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_774169" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-774169" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Chris-Long_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chris Long plans to move on from the Patriots. " width="757" height="505" /> Chris Long plans to move on from the Patriots. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Chris Long signed with the Patriots last offseason with one goal in mind: Winning a Super Bowl. He accomplished that goal, and <a href="http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2017/03/02/Chris-Long-bids-adieu-to-New-England-Patriots/6631488432313/" target="_blank">has since made it clear</a> that he is going to continue his career elsewhere. Long likely won't land a huge contract, but he will end up in a defensive scheme that is a better fit for his skillset.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_763224" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763224" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Danny-Shelton1.jpg" alt="Joe Robbins/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Danny Shelton is a massive human being | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the most commonly used clichés in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-slowest-nfl-combine-40-yard-dash-times-of-the-last-decade.html/" target="_blank">world of NFL scouting</a> is that “you can’t teach size.” NFL players are already some of the most massive human beings on the planet, so when a player is deemed to be large by NFL standards, there is a pretty good chance that the ground will shake with every step that player takes.

At the annual <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/what-are-the-highest-vertical-jumps-in-nfl-scouting-combine-history.html/" target="_blank">NFL Scouting Combine</a>, there is <a title="The NFL Combine is a Meat Market" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/combine-meat-market-little-disturbing-075700491--nfl.html" target="_blank">no way for players to hide anything from the scouts in attendance</a>. When they weigh-in, they wear nothing but a pair of <a title="NFL Draft Hopefuls Weigh-In at the Combine" href="http://blog.masslive.com/patriots/2015/02/nfl_draft_2015_fans_guide_to_t.html" target="_blank">skin-tight shorts</a>. When they do their testing, they again wear nothing but <a title="Under Armour Scores NFL Combine Apparel Deal" href="http://adage.com/article/special-report-marketer-alist-2012/armour-scores-big-stage-nfl-scouting-combine/238420/" target="_blank">skin-tight Under Armour apparel</a>. This gives the guys who will make the decisions on their draft status an excellent idea of their frame and their physique; <a title="Scouts Evaluate Prospects' Frames and Physiques" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/nfl-draft-scout/24980468/senior-bowl-auburns-sammie-coates-steals-show-at-south-weigh-in" target="_blank">both are traits</a> that some scouts feel are very indicative of long-term growth potential in the NFL.

Every year, there is a player that takes home the proverbial prize for being the largest player who attended that year’s Combine. In 2015, <a title="Danny Shelton NFL Combine Profile" href="http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/danny-shelton?id=2552325" target="_blank">it was Danny Shelton</a> (pictured above), a defensive tackle from Washington and eventual first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns, who weighed in at 339 pounds. While Shelton is undoubtedly a huge individual, he doesn’t even come close to cracking the list of the top five largest players in Combine history. Since the NFL Combine started tracking official statistics in 1999, 19 players have tipped the scales at 350 pounds or more.

With that, here is a look at the five largest players in NFL Combine history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Leonard Davis, offensive tackle, Texas – 2001</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763227" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-763227 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Leonard-Davis.jpg" alt="Doug Benc/Getty Images" width="640" height="960" /> Doug Benc/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Height:</span>  6-foot-6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weight:</span>  370 pounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Draft:</span>  Selected by the Arizona Cardinals with the second pick in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft.

Following a stellar career as a Texas Longhorn, Davis had a shockingly impressive NFL Combine for a player of his size, running a 5.32 40-yard dash, putting up 33 reps on the bench press, and posting a 28-inch vertical jump. He was drafted second overall by the Arizona Cardinals and spent the first six years of his career in Arizona before <a title="Dallas Cowboys Add Leonard Davis" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2787446" target="_blank">signing a lucrative free agent contract</a> with the Dallas Cowboys in 2007. With the Cowboys, Davis was named to three Pro Bowls and one All-Pro team.

<h2>4. Willie Jones, offensive tackle, Grambling State – 1999</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763229" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-763229 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Willie-Jones.jpg" alt="Stephen Dunn/Getty Images" width="640" height="1011" /> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Height:</span>  6-foot-7
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weight:</span>  372 pounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Draft:</span>  Undrafted

Jones is one of the largest players to ever participate in the NFL Scouting Combine. He ran a 5.58 40-yard dash, put up 30 reps on the bench press, and posted a 30-inch vertical jump, but went undrafted in the 1999 NFL Draft. Jones signed with the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted free agent where he spent part of the 1999 season. He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2000, where he played the final three seasons of his career.

<h2>3. Derrick Fletcher, offensive tackle, Baylor – 1999</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763233" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763233 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Derrick-Fletcher.jpg" alt="NFL Photos/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> NFL Photos/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Height:</span>  6-foot-6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weight:</span>  374 pounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Draft:</span>  Selected by the New England Patriots with the 154th pick in the fifth round of the 1999 NFL Draft.

Fletcher ran a 5.20 second 40-yard dash at the 1999 NFL Combine despite weighing in at 374 pounds. He would go on to play in 21 games in parts of five NFL seasons from 1999-2005. Fletcher spent two seasons with the New England Patriots, the team he was drafted by, one season with the Washington Redskins, one season with the Carolina Panthers, and two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

<h2>2. Mike Williams, offensive tackle, Texas – 2002</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763239" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-763239 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mike-Williams.jpg" alt="Win McNamee/Getty Images" width="640" height="862" /> Win McNamee/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Height:</span>  6-foot-6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weight:</span>  375 pounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Draft:</span>  Selected by the Buffalo Bills with the fourth pick in the first round of the 2002 NFL Draft.

After an All-American college career at the University of Texas, Williams attended the 2002 NFL Combine where he ran a 5.30 second 40-yard dash and had a vertical jump of 30 inches. He was widely considered to be one of the best players available in the 2002 NFL Draft. He ended up being selected fourth overall, but had a <a title="Mike Williams Has Always Battled Weight Issues" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/28/a-weighty-matter/?page=all" target="_blank">disappointing professional career</a> for a player with his draft status. He played four seasons with the Buffalo Bills before being released, and after three seasons out of football, he made a comeback with the Washington Redskins in 2009. His comeback was successful, but ended prematurely as did his career, <a title="Blood Clotting Ends Williams' Season" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8195a83f/printable/blood-clot-in-lung-forcing-redskins-williams-to-miss-season" target="_blank">due to blood clotting</a> that was found near his heart following the 2009 NFL season.

<h2>1. Aaron Gibson, offensive tackle, Wisconsin – 1999</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763241" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763241 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aaron-Gibson.jpg" alt="Brian Bahr/Getty Images" width="757" height="506" /> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Height:</span>  6-foot-6
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Weight:</span>  386 pounds
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Draft:</span>  Selected by the Detroit Lions with the 27th pick in the first round of the 1999 NFL Draft.

Gibson was the heaviest player to ever weigh-in at the NFL Scouting Combine. After his jaw-dropping height and weight measurements were announced, the former Wisconsin Badger took to the field and ran an impressive 5.35-second 40-yard dash, and a 4.54-second 20-yard shuttle. Gibson wound up being a first round draft choice, but <a title="Detroit Lions' Biggest Draft Busts" href="http://cover32.com/lions/2014/04/23/detroit-lions-10-biggest-draft-busts-over-last-35-years/" target="_blank">will ultimately go down as a bust</a>. It should come as no surprise that Gibson battled weight issues for his entire professional career – his listed weight of 410 pounds remains the heaviest in NFL history, in addition to suffering numerous injuries. His career ended in 2004 after stints with the Lions, Dallas Cowboys, and Chicago Bears.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_770199" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-770199" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NFL-Combine_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joe Robbins_Getty Images" width="800" height="534" /> The NFL Combine is a meat market | Joe Robbins_Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-offseason-cuts-2017.html/" target="_blank">It's no secret</a> that the athletes who play in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> are some of the strongest human beings on the planet. The truth of the matter is that every player, from the offensive linemen down to the wide receivers and cornerbacks, on the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-set-to-be-free-agents-in-2017.html/" target="_blank">32 NFL rosters</a> have strength that most average people can only dream of.

College football players that are hoping to carve out a career as professional have their strength measured at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/what-are-the-highest-vertical-jumps-in-nfl-scouting-combine-history.html/" target="_blank">NFL Scouting Combine</a> by how many times they can bench press 225 pounds. While this isn't a perfect test, it can expose both a glaring lack of strength and a shocking surplus of raw power in NFL hopefuls. Here is a look at the 12 highest bench press totals in NFL Combine history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. (tie) Russell Bodine (2014)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_762880" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-762880 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Russell-Bodine-640x426.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 42

The Cincinnati Bengals drafted Russell Bodine in the fourth round of the 2014 NFL draft. The 6-foot-3, 306-pound offensive lineman played his college ball at North Carolina, and the rookie started all 16 games as the Bengals’ center -- a feat he would repeat the following season.

<h2>10. (tie) DeMarcus “Tank" Tyler (2007)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_770281" align="aligncenter" width="683"]<img class="wp-image-770281 size-large" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tank-Tyler_Jamie-Squire_Getty-Images-683x1024.jpg" alt="Jamie Squire/Getty Images" width="683" height="1024" /> Tank Tyler wowed at the NFL Combine | Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 42

DeMarcus “Tank" Tyler played defensive tackle for North Carolina State and showcased his strength at the 2007 combine. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of that year, but hasn’t played in the NFL since 2009.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. (tie) Isaac Sopoaga (2004)</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Isaac-Sopoaga_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Isaac Sopoaga_Ezra Shaw_Getty Images" width="758" height="535" /> Isaac Sopoaga is a beast | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 42

Isaac Sopoaga, a defensive tackle from the University of Hawaii, put up 42 reps during the 2004 NFL Combine. He was eventually drafted in the fourth round by the San Francisco 49ers, and played 11 seasons in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Scott Young (2005)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_577529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-577529" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Philadelphia-Eagles-Helmet_Brian-Cleary_Getty-Images-1024x705.jpg" alt="Brian Cleary/Getty Images" width="757" height="521" /> The Eagles were impressed by Scott Young's Combine performance | Brian Cleary/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 43

Despite putting up 225 pounds 43 times during the 2005 NFL Combine, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Y/YounSc20.htm" target="_blank">Scott Young</a> did not have a long career in the NFL. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of that year’s draft, and only played three seasons in the league. Still, you have to be impressed with the strength from the offensive guard out of BYU.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. (tie) Brodrick Bunkley (2006)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_770288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-770288" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Brodrick-Bunkley_Grant-Halverson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Grant Halverson/Getty Images" width="757" height="508" /> Brodrick Bunkley carved out a nice NFL career | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 44

The Philadelphia Eagles drafted Florida State’s Brodrick Bunkley with the 14th pick in the 2006 NFL draft. Since that time, Bunkley has also played for the Denver Broncos and New Orleans Saints. Despite nine years in the NFL, it’s safe to say that Bunkley never lived up to expectations.

<h2>6. (tie) Dontari Poe (2012)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743296" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-743296" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dontari-Poe_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x700.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="800" height="547" /> Dontari Poe was a star at the 2012 NFL Combine | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 44

Dontari Poe is a force on the football field, and is way more than just a guy who benched 225 pounds 44 times. Poe was the 11th overall pick in the 2012 draft and the former Memphis Tiger has become one of the most dominant defensive tackles in the NFL. In his five NFL seasons he has been selected to two Pro Bowls and was named a second-team All-Pro in 2013.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. (tie) Jeff Owens (2010)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_770292" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-770292" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Jeff-Owens_Jim-McIsaac_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jim McIsaac/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Jeff Owens was an animal at the NFL Combine | Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 44

The Philadelphia Eagles continued their trend of drafting players that put up a ton of reps on the bench press, by selecting Georgia defensive tackle Jeff Owens in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL draft. It did not work out as Owens only played in one game.

<h2>3. (tie) Mitch Petrus</h2>
[caption id="attachment_762883" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-762883 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mitch-Petrus-640x445.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="756" height="526" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 45

Mitch Petrus was an offensive guard who played his college ball at Arkansas. During the 2010 combine, his 45 bench press reps helped him get drafted in the fifth round by the New York Giants. He would play three seasons in the NFL.

<h2>3. (tie) Mike Kudla (2006)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568887" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568887" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Helmet.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Pittsburgh Steelers gave Mike Kudla a chance | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 45

In 2006, Mike Kudla was said to be <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/historical/414842" target="_blank">one of the strongest players in the draft, and a weight room fanatic</a>. And the Ohio State Buckeye showed this brute strength with 45 reps on the bench press. Unfortunately, despite signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted rookie, Kudla was <a href="http://espn.go.com/colleges/osu/story/_/id/8012730/mike-kudla-loves-buzz-columbus" target="_blank">bothered by hamstring issues</a> and forced to give up his NFL aspirations.

<h2>3. (tie) Leif Larsen (2000)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_482660" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-482660" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bills-Helmet-Michael-Adamucci-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael Adamucci/Getty Images" width="757" height="509" /> The Buffalo Bills selected Leif Larson in the 6th round of the 2000 NFL Draft | Michael Adamucci/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 45

In 2000, UTEP defensive tackle Leif Larson put up the 45 reps on the bench press. He was drafted in the sixth round by the Buffalo Bills, but only managed to play in only 16 total games for his career.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Stephen Paea (2011)</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stephen-Paea_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Stephen Paea is one of the strongest players in NFL history | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="572" /> Stephen Paea is one of the strongest players in NFL history | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps</span>: 49

Oregon State defensive tackle Stephen Paea benched 225 pounds a ridiculous 49 times at the combine in 2011. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 2011 NFL draft, and signed with Washington for the 2015 campaign. Over five seasons in the NFL, Paea has started in 41 games.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total Reps:</span> 51

At the 1999 NFL combine, Eastern Kentucky defensive tackle <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/justinernest/2500560/profile" target="_blank">Justin Ernest</a> set a record on the bench press with a mind-boggling 51 reps. However, that strength did not translate into an NFL career. Ernest was not drafted by an NFL team, and he has no regular season appearances.

		<description><![CDATA[The annual 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine is one of the biggest stories of the offseason, but not all news is good news. Who has the worst 40-yard dash.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_755244" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-755244" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NFL-Scouting-Combine.jpg" alt="A player runs the dash." width="757" height="505" /> The 40-yard dash has become the ultimate test of speed | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

The annual 40-yard dash testing at the Combine has turned into <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-prospects-to-watch-at-the-2016-combine.html/" target="_blank">one of the biggest news stories</a> of the NFL offseason. Players have literally made — and lost — millions of dollars based on how well they run their 40 at the Combine. The 40-yard dash has become so mainstream that even Rich Eisen of the NFL Network runs a 40 in his suit at the event on a yearly basis. Here is a look at Eisen’s 40-yard dash at the 2014 NFL Combine:

Every year there are a handful of players who blow everyone away with a blazing fast 40 time. These players <a title="11 Fastest 40-Yard Dashes In NFL Combine History" href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/11-fastest-40-yard-dashes-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">receive a lot of media attention</a>, and they are the guys that fan bases get excited about. On the other hand, there are always guys who run jaw-droppingly slow 40-yard dashes at the NFL Combine. Those players rarely get any attention — that is, until now. Here’s a look at the 10 slowest 40-yard dash times at the NFL Combine over the last decade.

<h2>10. Ben Jones, 2012 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761458" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-761458 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ricky-Henry.jpg" alt="Ben Jones practices during the offseason." width="500" height="663" /> Ben Jones' performance was less than ideal | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.82 seconds

Even after running a slow 40-yard dash time at the 2012 NFL Combine, Jones was considered to be one of the best available centers in the 2012 NFL Draft. His slow 40 didn’t deter the Houston Texans from selecting him in the fourth round of the draft. Jones is still currently on the Texans’ active roster.
<h2>9. Richard Henry, 2011 NFL Combine</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.68 seconds

Henry attended the 2011 NFL Combine as an offensive guard prospect out of Nebraska. Needless to say, the Combine didn’t go well for Henry. He ended up going undrafted but signed with the Chicago Bears shortly after the 2011 NFL Draft and has been bouncing around practice squads ever since.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Nick Steitz, 2005 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766577" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-766577" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/New-Orleans-Saints-Nick-Steitz.jpg" alt="New Orleans Saints guard Nick Steitz sets to block during a preseason game." width="757" height="605" /> New Orleans Saints guard Nick Steitz sets to block during a preseason game | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.7 seconds

Steitz attended the 2005 NFL Combine as an offensive guard prospect out of Oregon. After performing poorly in nearly every physical test, Steitz’s draft stock plummeted, which led to him going undrafted. He spent time with the New England Patriots, Washington Redskins, and San Francisco 49ers but never played in a regular season game.

<h2>7. Terrence Cody, 2010 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761288" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-761288" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Terrence-Cody.jpg" alt="Terrence Cody sits on the bench and watches the action." width="757" height="516" /> Terrence Cody was a little disappointed with his performance | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.71 seconds

Cody was considered to be one of the top defensive line prospects in the 2010 NFL Draft, even after running a 5.71 40-yard dash at the 2010 NFL Combine. At the Combine, Cody weighed in at 354 pounds, which was actually down from his college playing weight of 370. Despite his slow 40 time, Cody went on to be selected in the second round of the draft by the Baltimore Ravens and was a key contributor to the team’s Super Bowl XLVII title. He is currently a free agent.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Stefon Wheeler, 2006 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766578" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-766578" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Stefon-Wheeler-New-Orleans-Saints.jpg" alt="Stefon Wheeler of the New Orleans Saints was not happy about his dash time." width="757" height="505" /> Stefon Wheeler of the New Orleans Saints was not happy about his dash time | Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.73 seconds

Wheeler attended the 2006 NFL Combine as a massive offensive tackle prospect out of Michigan State. Unfortunately, he did nothing to ease teams’ concerns about his slow feet and below-average athleticism. He went undrafted in the 2006 NFL Draft and spent time with both the Miami Dolphins and New Orleans Saints but never played in a regular-season game.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Johnnie Troutman, 2012 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766574" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-766574" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Keenan-Allen-Johnnie-Troutman-San-Diego-Chargers.jpg" alt="Wide receiver Keenan Allen and guard Johnnie Troutman of the San Diego Chargers celebrate after Allen's score." width="757" height="552" /> Wide receiver Keenan Allen (L) and guard Johnnie Troutman of the San Diego Chargers celebrate after Allen's score | Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.76 seconds

Despite running a slow 40-yard dash, Troutman, an offensive guard, did well enough in the other testing at the Combine and had a good enough college career that the San Diego Chargers drafted him in the fifth round of the 2012 NFL Draft. After a year on San Diego’s Injured Reserve list and another season as a backup, he has now worked his way up to being the starting left guard for the Chargers.

<h2>4. Dace Richardson, 2010 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761467" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-761467" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Josh-Oglesby.jpg" alt="Dace Richardson greets fans after a game." width="500" height="750" /> Dace Richardson greets fans after a game | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.79 seconds

Richardson had an all-around bad 2010 NFL Combine from a physical testing standpoint. His 40-yard dash time was slower than any other player who attended and played a big role in him going undrafted. He was invited to try out for the New York Giants but was never offered a contract. He last played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Josh Oglesby, 2012 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766594" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-766594" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Josh-Oglesby-Wisconsin.jpeg" alt="Wisconsin's Josh Oglesby rips the helmut off San Jose State's Vince Buhagiar." width="757" height="606" /> Wisconsin's Josh Oglesby rips the helmut off San Jose State's Vince Buhagiar | Source: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.8 seconds

Oglesby was once a blue-chip offensive tackle prospect. After <a title="Oglesby Turns to Coaching" href="http://host.madison.com/sports/college/football/badgers-football-former-uw-lineman-josh-oglesby-finds-his-calling/article_d463b33f-95e3-56fd-b374-87d78e3d65a4.html" target="_blank">six knee surgeries</a> while playing for Wisconsin, his health finally got the best of him. He ran an incredibly slow 40-yard dash at the 2012 NFL Combine, which led to him going undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft. He signed with the only team that would clear him medically, the Washington Redskins, but lasted only a few weeks.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Palauni Ma Sun, 2007 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_766579" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-766579" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Palauni-Ma-Sun-Oregon-Ducks.jpg" alt="Offensive guard Palauni Ma Sun of the Oregon Ducks looks on against the Washington State Cougars in 2006." width="500" height="747" /> Offensive guard Palauni Ma Sun of the Oregon Ducks looks on against the Washington State Cougars in 2006 | Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 5.86 seconds

Ma Sun was a massive offensive line prospect coming out of Oregon in 2007. While he may have been physically imposing, he did nothing to prove to scouts that he was physically gifted during his time at the Combine. He tested poorly in practically every category, and to the surprise of no one, he went undrafted in the 2007 NFL Draft. He spent time with the Washington Redskins but never made an active roster.

<h2>1.  Isaiah Thompson, 2011 NFL Combine</h2>
[caption id="attachment_761310" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-761310" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Isaiah-Thompson.jpg" alt="Isaiah Thompson warms up before a Combine event." width="756" height="425" /> Isaiah Thompson warms up before a Combine event | Source: NFL.com[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Official Combine 40 time</span>: 6 seconds

The unenviable distinction of being the player who ran the slowest 40-yard dash at the Combine over the last decade belongs to Thompson. The 300-pound Thompson was an offensive guard prospect out of Houston and was the only player in the last 10 years that failed to break the six-second mark when running his 40 at the Combine. It should come as no surprise that Thompson went undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft and is now out of the league.

One of the best methods for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-slowest-nfl-combine-40-yard-dash-times-of-the-last-decade.html/" target="_blank">measuring an NFL prospect's explosiveness</a> is the vertical jump test. It may seem like a simple and old-fashioned measurement, but the simple truth of the matter is that turning in a 40-plus inch vertical at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-are-the-6-highest-bench-press-totals-in-combine-history.html/" target="_blank">NFL Scouting Combine</a> can cause a mediocre player's draft stock to skyrocket.

Most recently, we all witnessed former Georgia and current Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver as well as former UConn and current Dallas Cowboys defensive back Byron Jones blow away the scouts, coaches, and front office executives at the 2015 NFL Combine with 45 and 44.5-inch vertical jumps, respectively.

How do Conley and Jones's impressive performances rank all time? Here is a look at the highest vertical jumps in NFL Combine history.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_710515" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710515" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jerry-Jones_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys owner and GM walks across the field." width="757" height="505" /> Jerry Jones is a great owner, but a terrible General Manager for the Dallas Cowboys. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

At first glance, when <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/10-best-dallas-cowboys-players-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">Dallas Cowboys</a> quarterback Tony Romo <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tony-romo-injury-helps-dallas-cowboys.html/" target="_blank">went down with another back injury</a> during the team's preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks, it looked like "America’s Team" lost the 2016 season for good.

Despite owner/General Manager Jerry Jones's <a href="http://www.thesportster.com/football/top-15-worst-moves-by-jerry-jones/" target="_blank">best ego-driven attempts</a> at destroying their roster, the Cowboys have built a team capable of contending in the NFC (credit actually goes to Jones's son, Stephen, and his team of scouts and executives) -- if an above-average starting quarterback remains on the roster.

As it turns out, the Cowboys look better off without Romo in their lineup. Under the leadership of Dak Prescott, the Cowboys blazed to an 11-2 record. Things looked good in Texas. Remember that while Dallas has the premier offensive line in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a>, that wouldn’t actually be the case if Jones had his way during the 2014 NFL Draft.

As a refresher, he pushed his personnel department toward selecting former Texas A&amp;M <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/johnny-manziel-dallas-cowboys.html/" target="_blank">quarterback Johnny Manziel</a>. However, in one of the only instances we recall during his reign as owner, Jones didn't get his way. The Cowboys instead chose Notre Dame offensive tackle Zack Martin. Since then, he's developed into an All-Pro performer as the team's right guard.

As for Manziel, practically every American citizen who watches the news knows <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-johnny-manziel-can-save-his-nfl-career.html/" target="_blank">what a disaster his NFL career</a> became. So everything's good, right? Not so fast.

Prescott's hot start cooled off. (He had three games that were a little more "back to earth," throwing for under 200 yards in each and notching just four touchdowns. Then, he broke that streak when he threw for 279 yards and connected on 32-36 passes against Tampa<span class="s1">.)</span> <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jerry-jones-reveals-2017-plan-for-tony-romo-imagines-opportunity-this-season/">Romo's name returned to Jerry's lips</a>, and we're right back in the middle of a quarterback controversy that everyone thought had ended.

[caption id="attachment_710516" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710516" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jimmy-Johnson-Jerry-Jones_Paul-K.-Buck_Getty-Images-1024x716.jpg" alt="Jimmy Johnson and Jerry Jones chat at a media conference." width="757" height="529" /> Jerry Jones ruined a great thing with Jimmy Johnson. | Paul K. Buck/Getty Images[/caption]

Remember: In 2015, the Dallas Cowboys took a flyer on a talented, but troubled defensive end named Greg Hardy. The move reeked of desperation, and despite the team’s best efforts, they could not control him. By year's end, the controversial pass rusher proved to be nothing more than a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-greg-hardys-presence-could-destroy-the-dallas-cowboys.html/" target="_blank">team cancer and a mediocre player</a>. Granted, many factors -- including Rom's injury -- played a role in the Cowboys' disastrous 2015 season. Signing Hardy simply added insult to injury.

We could go on and on about the less-than-stellar job Jones has done as the Cowboys <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-5-best-general-managers-in-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank">General Manager</a>. Don’t forget that he singlehandedly ruined Dallas's chance of having one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history by interfering with the way then-head coach Jimmy Johnson ran the team.

But it's time to jump right into the issue at hand. How will the Cowboys handle their quarterback situation when a healthy Romo returns to their lineup? We all remember that Jones would have preferred that Romo <a href="http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4754122/prescott-playing-well-but-jones-wants-romo-back-asap" target="_blank">instantly regain</a> his starting position over Prescott as soon as team doctors clear him to play. However, the veteran quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tony-romo-showed-that-one-man-is-not-bigger-than-the-team.html/?c">took one for the team</a> and accepted a backup role.  Now, though, with Prescott showing that he can have off-weeks (sometimes back-to-back ones), Jones has the chance to ruin another season for the NFL's most valuable franchise. Here’s why.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_580970" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580970" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Tony-Romo_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-1024x722.jpg" alt="Tony Romo pumps his fist after throwing a pass." width="757" height="534" /> The Tony Romo era may be coming to an end in Dallas. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

There is no arguing that Romo has experienced a nice NFL career. Since taking over as the Dallas Cowboys' starting quarterback, he's made four Pro Bowls and one All-Pro team; won 78 games; thrown for 34,154 yards and 247 touchdowns; and posted a career quarterback rating of 97.1. But at the same time, Romo has always had issues staying healthy. He's struggled with inconsistency, especially in clutch, big-game situations, and he's won only two career postseason games.

When it comes to the 36-year-old signal caller, what you see is what you get (if he can even return to full strength). That brings us to Prescott. The rookie fourth-round pick from Mississippi State has been outstanding since his first NFL game during the 2016 preseason. Through 13 regular-season games, Prescott is clearly one of the most overlooked draft prospects in recent NFL history. He's flashed the ability to be an elite quarterback at the game's highest level and looks like the type of player a franchise can build around.

Up to this point, the 23-year-old signal caller has thrown for 1,239 yards and four touchdowns with a quarterback rating of 90.51. He's also added 61 yards and three touchdowns on the ground. More importantly, though, Prescott led the Cowboys to a 11-2 record to open the season. In fact, they could be 12-1 if not for some <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dallas-cowboys-repeat-mistakes.html/" target="_blank">poor clock management</a> against the Giants in Week 1).

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_688743" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-688743" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Dak-Prescott_-Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-1024x898.jpg" alt="Dak Prescott walks across the sideline." width="757" height="664" /> Dak Prescott is a great player for the Dallas Cowboys. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

At the end of the day, it's clear that Prescott is a great fit for the Dallas Cowboys' run-first offense, which features another dynamic rookie in running back Ezekiel Elliott. Dallas simply does not have a talented enough defense to bail out an offense that turns the ball over multiple times per game (Romo has 139 career turnovers in 127 career starts).

On top of that, Prescott's ability to make plays with his legs outside of the pocket is something that Romo is incapable of at this point in his career.

While there is a part of us that agrees with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-unwritten-rules-of-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank">unwritten rule of football</a> that states "a player should never lose their job because of injury," we also know that the NFL is a cutthroat business revolving around winning games. In our opinion, the Cowboys will win more games with Prescott than they will with Romo.<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_574726" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574726" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jerry-Jones_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys owner and General Manager Jerry Jones sits at a media conference." width="757" height="505" /> Dallas Cowboys owner and General Manager Jerry Jones sits at a media conference. | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

If Jones forces head coach Jason Garrett to return to Romo, our guess is this team will implode. They will digress at the quarterback position; Garrett will lose credibility with the team; and the Cowboys will likely end up with a divided locker room. Furthermore, parting ways with one of the most recognizable players in franchise history will be a major step toward solving the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/" target="_blank">team's salary cap issues</a>.

We will be the first to tell you that Jones is one of the best owners in the league. He has done great things for both the Cowboys and the NFL. But, when it comes to being a General Manager, Jones is downright awful.

He reminds us of a billionaire who treats a real-life team like he is playing "Franchise Mode" on the latest installment of Madden Football. If Jones oversteps his boundaries again, he will ruin yet another promising season for the Dallas Cowboys.

		<description><![CDATA[The New England Patriots are one of the most recognizable franchises ever. Here are the 5 best players in Pats history – including Tom Brady.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_763815" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763815" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Brady-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time" width="757" height="514" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Not counting this Sunday, the New England Patriots have made eight trips to the Super Bowl, and won four (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014). That’s not uncommon knowledge, but the fact that the Patriots franchise is tied with the Steelers and Cowboys for the most Super Bowl appearances in league history isn’t often remarked upon.

Patriot success, of course, is a mostly recent phenomenon, as opposed to Steeler and Cowboy organizations that have been largely dominant since the 1970s. As a perennial contender, the Patriots are still involved in a remarkable run — they have claimed 12 of the last 14 AFC East regular season titles.

“The Patriot Way" largely came into being <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after Bill Belichick and Tom Brady</a> effectively joined forces on a full-time basis, beginning in 2000. The Patriot Way, to elaborate, emphasizes crisp execution, selflessness, innovative play calling, and a staunch commitment to football that works to field cohesive team units that appeared to be better than the sum of their respective parts. Each of the five greatest Patriots of all time echo these sentiments.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Troy Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763831" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763831" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Troy-Brown-Jim-McIsaac-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time – Including Tom Brady" width="757" height="550" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]

In 1993, New England drafted Troy Brown in the 8th round (198th overall pick) out of Marshall as a return specialist. Eventually, Brown started to see game-time action as the third receiver in passing situation, although he actually did not emerge as a full-time starter and primary target until 2000: The following season he racked up<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowTr00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 101 receptions for 1,199 yards and 5 touchdowns</a>.

That postseason, Troy Brown took a 55-yard punt return back to the house and also scooped up a blocked field goal that led to another score in the 2001-2002 AFC Championship Game. After dispatching the Steelers 24-7, the Cinderella Patriots went on to claim their first Lombardi Trophy with a 20-17 win against the high-octane St. Louis Rams. Adam Vinatieri split the uprights on a 48-yard kick as time expired. Troy Brown went on to help win two more Super Bowls with the Patriots.

In all, Troy Brown racked up 557 receptions for 6,366 receiving yards and 31 touchdowns, through 15 years of service as a career Patriot. As a utility man, Brown saw time at wide receiver, return man, cornerback, and even emergency quarterback.

<h2>2. John Hannah</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763843" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-763843" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John-Hannah-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time – Including Tom Brady" width="756" height="605" /> Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Often mentioned alongside Anthony Muñoz as one of the greatest offensive linemen of all time, John Hannah was relatively undersized, standing 6-foot-2 and 265 pounds. The Hog, of course, more than made up for his lack of size, through quickness, agility, textbook technique, and above all else, an iron will. As an athletic lineman, Hannah was a devastating blocker in space, where he would work as the pulling guard on sweeps and counter draws.

A model of consistency, Hannah was selected to nine Pro Bowls, between 1976 and 1985. That last season, he made his one and only trip to the Super Bowl, which turned out to be a 46-10 loss to the ’85 Bears.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Ben Coates</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763862" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-763862" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ben-Coates-Matthew-Stockman-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time – Including Tom Brady" width="757" height="503" /> Matthew Stockman/Getty Images[/caption]

Ben Coates laid the groundwork for Rob Gronkowski, another player who could become an all-time Patriot great, and tight end dominance in New England. Unlike Gronk, Coates has remained historically underrated. Several NFL analysts have gone so far as to identify Coates as <a href="http://www.notinhalloffame.com/football/item/1226-87-ben-coates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Hall of Fame snub</a>.

In 1993, Bill Parcells installed Ben Coates as a focal point for the Patriots offense. That year, the wide-bodied 6-foot-5 tight end emerged as the ultimate security blanket for a young Drew Bledsoe. Coates was especially adept at working the soft zone underneath, where he could clear out space, and move the chains. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CoatBe00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 1994</a>, he hauled in 96 receptions for 1,174 yards, and 7 touchdowns. Two years later, the Pats were on the march toward Super Bowl XXXI, although they came up empty handed (Coates ultimately won a Super Bowl, as part of the 2000 Ravens.)

As a Patriot, Coates hauled in 490 receptions,good for 5,471 yards and 50 touchdowns. At the time of his retirement, Coates was the fourth most productive tight end in the history of the NFL, behind only Ozzie Newsome, Kellen Winslow, and Shannon Sharpe.

<h2>4. Vince Wilfork</h2>
[caption id="attachment_763899" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-763899" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Wilfork-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time – Including Tom Brady" width="756" height="503" /> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

In 2004, the Patriots <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WilfVi20.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drafted Vince Wilfork with the 21st overall pick</a> out of the University of Miami. He became the anchor of the defense almost immediately.

At 6-foot-2 and 325 pounds, Wilfork would take on two blockers at the point of attack and control the line of scrimmage. Despite his stature, Wilfork was deceptively quick, and could knife into the backfield to drop ball carriers for losses. Because of this versatility, coach Bill Belichick was free to experiment with four, three, and even two-down lineman fronts to further confuse and terrorize opposing offenses.

As an 12-year pro, Wilfork has already made 5 trips to the Pro Bowl as one of the best defensive tackles of his generation. A winner, Vince Wilfork helped the Patriots lay claim to two Lombardi trophies.

<h2>5. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_744032" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="wp-image-744032" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tuck-Rule.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest New England Patriots of All Time – Including Tom Brady" width="758" height="539" /> Matt Campbell/Getty Images[/caption]

Tom Brady largely silenced his remaining critics after the Patriots <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201502010sea.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated the Seattle Seahawks</a> 28-24 in Super Bowl XLIX. Brady took home MVP honors for the Big Game after completing 74% of his passes, good for 328 yards and 4 touchdowns, leaving him with four titles in six trips to the Super Bowl. Brady, a former sixth-round draft pick, has emerged as the most decorated athlete in football.

As a Patriot, Brady has been remarkable in consistently leading a ragtag group deep into the postseason. Leading Patriot receivers have included the aforementioned Troy Brown, alongside the likes of Kevin Faulk, Ben Watson, and Jabar Gaffney. In 2007, Brady put together a career year (4,806 yards and 50 touchdowns), after the Patriots finally splurged on coveted free agents Randy Moss, Wes Welker, and Donte Stallworth. This undefeated run, however, did end in infamy, as the high-powered Patriot offense lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants.

In recent years, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady appeared to return back to a full embrace of the Patriot Way. This latest title run included Brady handing off and tossing passes to former castoffs Jonas Gray, LeGarrette Blount, and Brandon LaFell — proof positive that Brady can elevate the play of any teammate he’s given.

The New England Patriots punched their ticket to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/super-bowl-2017-location.html/" target="_blank">Super Bowl 51 in Houston</a> with their dominating victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2016 AFC Championship Game on Sunday night. Behind an amazing performance out of Tom Brady, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tom-brady-best-quarterback-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">who is the greatest player</a> in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> history, the Pats are now set to represent the AFC on the biggest stage in professional sports for the seventh time in the last 16 years.

This time around, New England will face a team in the Atlanta Falcons, who don’t have a long history of postseason success. Since their inception in 1966, the Falcons have won only two conference championships (1998 and 2016) and six division titles; they have made a grand total of 13 playoff appearances; and they are one of 13 NFL franchises that have yet to win a Super Bowl title.

To put a little perspective on the difference in history between the Falcons and Patriots just consider these eye-opening facts:
<ul>
 	<li>The Patriots have 14 division titles since the turn of the century. The Falcons have six since 1966.</li>
 	<li>The Falcons have nine postseason wins in franchise history. New England quarterback Tom Brady has won 24 postseason games over the course of his 17-year NFL career.</li>
 	<li>New England will play in their ninth Super Bowl. Atlanta will play in their second.</li>
</ul>
The above list could go on and on, but we’ve given you enough to make our point.

Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Matt Ryan is ready for the Super Bowl | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite their lack of postseason history, the Falcons are a serious threat to the Patriots in Super Bowl 51. Their quarterback, Matt Ryan, is playing the best football of his career and is the overwhelming favorite to take home the 2016 NFL MVP award (he was already named league MVP by the Pro Football Writers of America); they have two dynamic running backs (Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman); they have arguably the top wide receiver in the game (Julio Jones); they have an excellent offensive line; and their young defense seems to get better with every passing week.

When it comes down to it, the Falcons may actually own the most explosive offense the Patriots have faced in a Super Bowl since the St. Louis Rams had the “Greatest Show on Turf” in Super Bowl XXXVI in 2001.

The Patriots will enter Super Bowl 51 riding a nine-game winning streak. As of today, they are <a href="http://www.nj.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/01/super_bowl_2017_early_betting_line_point_spread_od.html" target="_blank">three-point favorites</a> to take home their fifth Lombardi Trophy in franchise history (the over/under has been set at 57 points for what it’s worth).

While it definitely won’t be easy (remember, the Pats will lack All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski), there are multiple reasons why the oddsmakers in Las Vegas have confidence that the Pats will get the job done. With that being said, here are seven reasons why we believe the Patriots will win Super Bowl 51.

<h2> 1. Tom Brady has a massive chip on his shoulder</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574904" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574904" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1024x712.jpg" alt="Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Tom Brady has been a man on a mission all year | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

It's no secret that Tom Brady plays every snap like he has something to prove. It all started <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-drafted-ahead-tom-brady.html/" target="_blank">when he was snubbed as an NFL draft prospect</a>; he wasn't selected until the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. The chip on his shoulder grew even larger in 2016 when he was forced to serve a four-game suspension for his role in Deflategate. If you ask us, nothing would be sweeter for Brady (and anyone with ties to the Pats) than to put NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a situation where he has to get on stage and personally hand him this year's Lombardi Trophy.

<h2>2. Their experience is invaluable</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584511" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584511" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Bill-Belichick_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1024x779.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Reasons Tom Brady and the Patriots Can Win Super Bowl 51" width="757" height="576" /> Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have 31 games worth of postseason experience together. | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the past 15-plus years, the Patriots built one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history -- and in all of American professional sports for that matter, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-new-england-patriots-4-biggest-scandals.html/" target="_blank">despite being viewed as cheaters</a> by most of their rivals. In total, they've won four Super Bowl championships, seven conference championships (an NFL record for both a head coach and a starting quarterback), 14 division titles, and 24 postseason games.

The consistent duo they have had throughout all of their success: Tom Brady at quarterback and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-bill-belichick-sent-packing.html/" target="_blank">Bill Belichick as their head coach</a>. If having the most successful quarterback-head coach partnership in NFL history isn't enough, the Patriots still have several players on their roster who were a part of their Super Bowl XLIV-winning team from 2014.

<h2>3. Their offensive line is quietly outstanding in 2016</h2>
[caption id="attachment_663451" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-663451" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nate-Solder_Winslow-Townson_Getty-Images-1-1024x1008.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Reasons Tom Brady and the Patriots Can Win Super Bowl 51" width="757" height="745" /> Nate Solder is back in the Patriots' starting lineup in 2016 | Winslow Townson/Getty Images[/caption]

The New England Patriots’ offensive line issues flew under the radar in 2015 in large part due to Brady’s elite ability to get rid of the ball quickly. In fact, if Brady didn’t have one of the quickest releases in league history, the Pats’ offensive line would have been ridiculed to no end in 2015. Fortunately for the Patriots, their offensive line has managed to stay healthy and are <a href="http://www.patsfans.com/patriots/blog/2016/09/27/patriots-offensive-line-better-in-2016/" target="_blank">playing at a high level in 2016</a>.

Here is a look at how each of their five starting offensive linemen graded out in 2016 according to <a href="http://www.profootballfocus.com" target="_blank">Pro Football Focus</a>:
<ul>
 	<li>LT: Nate Solder, 88.0</li>
 	<li>LG: Joe Thuney, 69.1</li>
 	<li>C: David Andrews, 79.1</li>
 	<li>RG: Shaq Mason, 84.5</li>
 	<li>RT: Marcus Cannon, 87.7</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. They are playing for history</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587032" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587032" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images1-1024x738.jpg" alt="Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images1.jpg" width="757" height="546" /> Tom Brady is playing like a man who still has something to prove in 2016 | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

With their win in the 2016 AFC Championship Game, Tom Brady and Bill Belichick set new NFL records for the most conference championships/Super Bowl appearances by a starting quarterback and head coach, respectively. Right now, Brady is tied with Joe Montana for the most Super Bowl wins by a starting quarterback. Belichick is tied with Chuck Noll for the most Super Bowl wins by a head coach. If the Pats win, Brady and Belichick will stand alone.

<h2>5. They have a plan for Julio Jones</h2>
[caption id="attachment_723506" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-723506" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Matt-Patricia-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Pats defensive coordinator Matt Patricia could be an NFL head coach soon enough | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Pats defensive coordinator Matt Patricia could be an NFL head coach soon enough | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

As a whole, the Patriots' defense massively improved in 2016. And when it comes to slowing down elite, game-changing wide receivers, they have been quite successful. Throughout the 2016 season, the New England defense, led by defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, has kept guys like A.J. Green, Antonio Brown (twice), DeAndre Hopkins, Doug Baldwin, Demaryius Thomas, and Emmanuel Sanders from singlehandedly beating them.

They typically match up cornerback Malcolm Butler with the opposing offense's best wide receiver and give him safety help over the top. Our guess: This is the approach they will use with Jones. And if they can prevent him from taking the game over, the Pats will likely come out victorious.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. They have a balanced, flexible offensive scheme</h2>
[caption id="attachment_728620" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728620" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Josh-McDaniels_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1024x730.jpg" alt="FOXBORO, MA - DECEMBER 28: Offensive Coordinator Josh McDaniels of the New England Patriots looks on before a game against the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium on December 28, 2014 in Foxboro, Massachusetts. (Photo by Jim Rogash/Getty Images)Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> Josh McDaniels has one of the most flexible offensive schemes in the league | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Josh McDaniels may have been a terrible head coach, but there is no denying that he has been a great offensive coordinator during his time with the Patriots. One of his best qualities as a play-caller is his flexibility. He has a knack for taking what opposing defenses give him, and changing his game plan on the fly if need be.

Regardless of how the Falcons choose to defend them, we expect the Patriots to have quite a bit of offensive success in Super Bowl 51.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. They have Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708018" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708018" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tom-Brady_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-1-1024x678.jpg" alt="There will never be another Tom Brady | Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="501" /> There will never be another Tom Brady | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

This one really needs no explanation. Brady is the best player in NFL history and thrives in big game situations. There is a reason why he is already the winningest postseason quarterback in league history (by a wide margin). Make no mistake about it, Brady's presence is a huge advantage for the Pats.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Date</span>: February 5, 2017
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Time</span>: 6:30 pm <span style="font-weight: 400">Eastern Standard Time</span> (unofficial)
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Location</span>: NRG Stadium in Houston
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Teams:</span> New England Patriots vs. Atlanta Falcons

After a six-year hiatus, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-your-cheat-sheet-of-super-bowl-champions.html/" target="_blank">Super Bowl</a> will return to the Lone Star State in 2017. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>’s championship game was last played in Texas in 2011 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. And for the third time in NFL history, the city of Houston will play host to the biggest game in American professional sports this coming February.

For the second time in NFL history, the Super Bowl will occur at the home of the Houston Texans, NRG Stadium in downtown Houston. NRG Stadium opened in August 2002, and has a capacity of just under 72,000, with the ability to expand to accommodate more seating when necessary (Hint: you can expect to see standing room only tickets available for Super Bowl 51).

The facility has a retractable roof, but given the game's magnitude, it will almost surely be played indoors with the roof closed. More importantly, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-terrible-super-bowl-50-turf-turns-michael-oher-into-an-ice-skater/" target="_blank">unlike Super Bowl 50</a> in Santa Clara, Calif., one thing the league won’t have to worry about at this year’s Super Bowl is the quality and the conditions of the field, as NRG Stadium features artificial turf.

It may be two weeks away, but here’s who the oddsmakers at the sportsbooks in Las Vegas are currently <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-li.html/" target="_blank">giving the best odds to win Super Bowl 51</a> in 2017. History proves, though, that every one of the teams that looks good on paper now are one or two key injuries away from being just another middle-of-the-road team.

As we mentioned, the city of Houston is no stranger to hosting major sporting events. Since NRG Stadium opened in 2002, the Houston stadium has hosted one Super Bowl (Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004), two NCAA Men’s College Basketball Final Fours, numerous international soccer matches and concerts, and college football’s annual Texas Bowl (since 2006). On top of that, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is a co-tenant (with the Texans) of NRG Stadium.

Fox won the right to broadcast Super Bowl 51, and the network will have its top crew working the game (barring any unforeseen changes in plans). Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman will join longtime sportscaster Joe Buck in the booth, while Erin Andrews, Tony Siragusa, and Jason Whitlock will provide sideline commentary and in-studio analysis.

<h2>Future Super Bowl locations</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qoGP1NNJwY?rel=0"></iframe>
<h2>Minneapolis, Minnesota <span class="s1">– </span>2018</h2>
In 2018, Super Bowl 52 will occur at U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis. The new home of the Minnesota Vikings, which cost just over $1 billion to build, was officially completed on June 17, 2016 and features the five largest pivoting glass doors in the world. The first regular-season NFL game in U.S. Bank Stadium history will be a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-with-the-most-favorable-schedules-next-season.html/" target="_blank">Sunday Night Football matchup</a> between the Vikings and the Green Bay Packers.
<h2>Atlanta, Georgia <span class="s1">– </span>2019</h2>
In 2019, Super Bowl 53 will go down at the future home of the Atlanta Falcons, Mercedes-Benz Stadium (see above video), which is scheduled to complete construction in early June 2017.  The Falcons will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-has-the-toughest-schedule-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">play their final season</a> at the Georgia Dome in 2016 before officially moving to their new $1.4 billion dwelling in downtown Atlanta for the 2017 season.
<h2>Miami, Florida <span class="s1">– </span>2020</h2>
Currently, Super Bowl 54 is scheduled to take place Miami at New Miami Stadium in 2020. This would mark the sixth time in NFL history that the Super Bowl would be played in the Miami area.
<h2>Los Angeles, California <span class="s1">– 2021</span></h2>
Super Bowl 55 is currently slated to occur in Los Angeles in 2021, presumably at the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-nfl-stadium-renderings-pg-photogallery.html" target="_blank">new billion-dollar stadium</a> that will be built to house the LA Rams and any other franchise that relocates to the area.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_602874" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-602874" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Von-Miller-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="Von Miller of the Denver Broncos celebrates winning Super Bowl 50" width="757" height="527" /> Von Miller and the Denver Broncos are Super Bowl champions | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

It feels like only yesterday Peyton Manning <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-retirements-2016.html/">rode off into the sunset</a> after leading the Denver Broncos <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">to a victory</a> in Super Bowl 50. Yet, in reality, a lot has happened since then. We experienced the ups and downs of free agency; we dealt with the hectic process surrounding the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">NFL</a> draft; and last but not least, we suffered through another long and arduous preseason.

But all that is in the past now. The 2016 regular season came and went, and football has never looked so good. While the Broncos came into the 2016 season as the defending Super Bowl champs, and started the year off 4-0, unfortunately for Denver fans, they failed to make it into the postseason.

With that in mind, now that the stage is officially set for the biggest game of the year, here's a look at the remaining teams' odds of winning Super Bowl LI.

<h2>2. Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660656" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660656" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Matt-Ryan_Chris-Graythen_Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="Chris Graythen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Matt Ryan is ready to take the Falcons all the way | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: +125

Led by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">quarterback Matt Ryan</a>, the Atlanta Falcons closed out the year with an 11-5 record, winning the NFC South and clinching a first-round bye as the conference's No. 2 seed. If you're from the ATL, there's definitely reason to be optimistic.

The Falcons finished the season with the highest-scoring offense in the NFL, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/atl/2016.htm">averaging 33.8 points per game</a>. And thanks to a four-game winning streak to close out the regular season, they entered playoffs as one of the hottest and most confident teams in all of football -- just as the Seattle Seahawks.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_582483" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582483" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Devonta-Freeman-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Devonta Freeman is playing at an elite level | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite being the more experienced team, the Seahawks had no answer for Atlanta's high-powered offense. Ryan threw for 338 yards and three touchdowns, and the Falcons generated 422 yards of total offense. This divisional-round showdown proved to be more lopsided than anyone could've predicted, as the AFC South champs won convincingly <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201701140atl.htm">36-20</a>.

Playoff success isn't something that one usually associates with the Atlanta Falcons and their All-Pro quarterback. However, as we've seen throughout the majority of the 2016 season, these Birds are a completely different animal. The Green Bay Packers found this out the hard way in the NFC championship game.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_754798" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-754798" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Matt-Ryan-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Matt Ryan is ready for the Super Bowl | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Matt Ryan is ready for the Super Bowl | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The Falcons jumped on the Packers early, and never let up. Behind Ryan's 392 yards passing and five scores (four passing, one rushing), Atlanta's high-powered offense torched Green Bay for a whopping 493 total yards and 44 points. Even with Rodgers at the helm, the NFC North champs were simply no match for the motivated Falcons.

Thanks to an impressive <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201701220atl.htm">44-21 victory</a>, the Falcons advance to the Super Bowl for the second time in franchise history. This group might not be the favorites heading into the big game, but that's hardly a reason to count out Atlanta. With the way this rolling, the Falcons are poised to give the AFC champs a runs for their money.

<h2>1. New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587032" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587032" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images1-640x461.jpg" alt="Tom Brady cheers after winning a game | Jim Rogash/ Getty Images" width="757" height="546" /> Tom Brady has been lethal in 2016 | Jim Rogash/ Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Odds</span>: -155

In the four weeks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tom-brady/">Tom Brady</a> served his suspension, the New England Patriots showed the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-patriots-win-super-bowl-51.html/">discipline, focus, and experience</a> of a champion team. Using two different quarterbacks, including a rookie, the Pats did their jobs, handled their business, and went 3-1. Then Brady <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-games-tom-brady-career.html/">returned to the fold</a> and the rest of the NFL got to see what New England looked like at full strength. In a word: lethal.

<!--nextpage-->

The Patriots finished the regular season as the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a 14-2 record. They are overwhelming the opposition on both sides of the ball, and they have a fired-up quarterback poised to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-vegas-picking-win-2016-mvp-award.html/">add more individual hardware</a> to his already stocked trophy case. On top of that, even when the Pats don't play their best game, they still find a way to <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201701140nwe.htm">trounce an opponent 18 points</a>. So much for postseason competition.

[caption id="attachment_754802" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-754802" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Image-640x427.jpg" alt="Tom Brady leads the Patriots back to the Super Bowl | Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Tom Brady leads the Patriots back to the Super Bowl | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

If any team in the AFC had a legit shot at toppling the Pats at Gillette Stadium, it was the Pittsburgh Steelers. But as we quickly realized, just because a team <em>can</em> do it, doesn't mean it actually <em>will</em> do it. The Patriots are a force to be reckoned with, and they emphatically showcased their brilliance in the AFC title game against the Steelers.

[caption id="attachment_754806" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-754806" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/New-England-Patriots-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Pats are the team to beat at Super Bowl 51 | Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Pats are the team to beat at Super Bowl 51 | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Brady made a formidable Steelers group look amateurish. The future Hall of Famer lit them up for 384 yards and three touchdown passes, and the Pats rolled to a convincing <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201701220nwe.htm">36-17 win</a>. As expected, New England is the favorite going into Super Bowl LI. And while the Falcons have the top offense in the National Football League, at this point, it's hard to imagine anyone stopping these Patriots.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_781028" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781028 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ray-Seals-Timothy-Clary-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="530" /> Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

You don’t need to go to college to play in the NFL. This might seem counterintuitive, because the majority of the players in the NFL come from an NCAA team, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-colleges-with-the-most-players-in-the-nfl-right-now.html/" target="_blank">typically very prestigious Division I NCAA teams at that</a>, but there’s actually nothing in <a href="https://www.nflregionalcombines.com/Docs/Eligibility%20rules.pdf" target="_blank">the league’s eligibility rules</a> that exclusively specify any amount of college education. It is true that <em>if</em> an athlete goes to college, there are certain rules and regulations that must be abided by, but the idea that higher education is mandatory for NFL players simply isn’t correct.

What these players are, though, is extraordinarily uncommon — NFL scouts love college resumes and game tape, after all. For every Jarryd Hayne, or the guy who toiled away in the CFL or other pro leagues that are a step or two removed from the biggest sports league in America, there are legions of athletes who proudly call out their alma mater during the prerecorded pregame introductions. This is not about those guys. This is about the five best NFL players that avoided the NCAA entirely.
<h2>1. Ray Seals</h2>
Pictured above laying into Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, Seals is one of the most well known NFL players to have skipped college in league history. Indeed, as a starting defensive end on a Super Bowl team (in this case, the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX), Seals reached the apex of his position, even though the Steelers would end up losing that contest. Seals made his way to the NFL by stints with minor league football franchises, and would <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SealRa21.htm" target="_blank">ultimately spend eight seasons</a> playing at the highest level of professional football, playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Carolina Panthers as well as the aforementioned Steelers.

<h2>2. Eric Swann</h2>
[caption id="attachment_781167" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781167 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Eric-Swann-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="496" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the reasons that the NCAA provides such a dependable tunnel for professional caliber talent in the world of football is the lack of a universally recognizable second tier. In other words, there’s the NFL, and then there’s everything else — and for players like Eric Swann, who was ruled academically ineligible to play for North Carolina State and wound up playing for the now-defunct Bay State Titans, <a href="http://articles.philly.com/1991-05-19/sports/25797723_1_eric-swann-bay-state-titans-college-football" target="_blank">described as “a bunch of nobodies in Massachusetts</a>," being drafted by the Arizona Cardinals without playing a single second of college football must have been indescribable.

It’s worth noting here that Swann did briefly attend Wake Forest Technical College before dropping out to play with the Titans, but he’s included here because his collegiate tenure was brief enough that he’s listed as having “No College" on <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/ericswann/2503209/profile" target="_blank">his official NFL page</a>.
<h2>3. Sav Rocca</h2>
Easily the best name on the entire list, Sav Rocca was a latecomer to the NFL — he didn’t play in the league proper until the age of 36, when he caught on with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2006, becoming the oldest rookie in league history. What was he doing before his debut? Playing Australian football, which is <a href="http://visual.ly/what-difference-between-american-football-rugby-and-australian-rules-football" target="_blank">not the same as American football</a>, or rugby, for that matter.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4.  Michael Lewis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_781379" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-781379 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lewis-Harry-How-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="515" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

All hail the Beer Guy! Michael Lewis, former Budweiser truck driver, finally caught on in the NFL after a decade of slogging through indoor and arena football leagues after graduating high school in 1990. The New Orleans native finally got his break on football’s biggest stage when his hometown team, the New Orleans Saints, signed him. The eventual All-Pro, who came into the league with <a href="http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/sports/nfl/saints/2014/11/26/tompkins-beer-man-brews-important-message/70128102/" target="_blank">the mostly-modest goal to “play in one NFL game</a>," would eventually carve out a six-year career that <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LewiMi00.htm" target="_blank">started when he was 30 years old</a>.
<h2>5. Lawrence Okoye</h2>
All of these athletes bypassed the NCAA and the traditional college experience for one reason or another, but only Lawrence Okoye has a spot waiting for him whenever he wants it, as the third-year defensive lineman for the New York Jets. Okoye has a distinguished career as an Olympic athlete, and<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-2198576/Back-school-London-2012-Olympics-discus-star-Lawrence-Okoye-return-Daily-Mail-Schools-Rugby.html" target="_blank"> a place to study law at Oxford waiting for him</a> whenever his sports career starts to wind down. He’s also a rugby player, and became the first of two such athletes on the franchise’s active roster <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000475963/article/australian-rugby-star-jarryd-hayne-signs-with-49ers" target="_blank">once they signed Jarryd Hayne</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Retail sales is a good way to gauge an individual NFL player's popularity. Here's a look at the 10 players who have the highest-selling jerseys in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_703463" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703463" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Odell-Beckham-Jr.-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Odell Beckham Jr., pumps up the crowd | Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Odell Beckham Jr. is obviously a fan favorite | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

You don't have to be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-with-genius-iqs.html/">a genius</a> to know that in the world of professional sports, talent on the field usually equates to popularity off it. The more a player dominates the rest of the competition, the more likely fans will go out of their way to associate with said player. In the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">National Football League</a>, this tends to mean one thing: jersey sales.

If you're a premier player in the NFL, then there's a good chance the fans -- particularly those who truly love their hometown team -- will spend big bucks on your top. The fact is, love means loyalty, and loyalty means merchandise sales. Welcome to "Sports Commerce 101." Of course, as you might expect, some players are more popular than others. If we happen to go by jersey sales, then we know which ones stand out among the rest.

<a href="http://www.nflshop.com/pages/Top_Selling_Jerseys">According to the numbers</a> on NFLShop.com, the NFL's official online site, these 10 players generated the highest-selling jerseys in the NFL in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_564882" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-564882 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Aaron-Rodgers_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Aaron Rodgers looks for a target | Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers is a special QB | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The Green Bay Packers are never out of it with Aaron Rodgers under center. After a slow start to his 2016 campaign, the two-time MVP has been nothing short of spectacular over the final few weeks of the season. This year, Rodgers is completing 65.5% of his passes and throwing for 4,128 yards, a league-leading 36 touchdown passes, and just seven interceptions. At this rate, it wouldn't surprise us if the whole state of Wisconsin owned a No. 12 jersey.

<h2>9. Derek Carr, QB, Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_591503" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-591503" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Derek-Carr_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x444.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Derek Carr throws downfield | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Derek Carr deserves all the praise | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Derek Carr's season may have been cut short because of a broken fibula, but that doesn't diminish what he accomplished in 2016. The Raiders quarterback  joined his second consecutive Pro Bowl team. He dazzled football fans with his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CarrDe02.htm">28-to-6 touchdown-to-interception ratio</a> and fourth-quarter heroics. And he led Oakland to a 12-3 record and an AFC West crown. It's a shame we won't get to see what Carr might could've done in the postseason. Then again, there's always 2017 and beyond.

<h2>8. Odell Beckham Jr., WR, New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672682" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672682" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Odell-Beckham-Jr.-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Odell Beckham Jr. smiles before a game | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> Odell Beckham Jr. knows he's good. Really good | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

His antics may make it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/odell-beckham-jr-contract-extension.html/">difficult to build a team around him</a>, but there's no denying that Odell Beckham Jr. is one of the most talented wide receivers in the NFL. After wowing fans with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BeckOd00.htm">96 catches, 1,450 receiving yards, and 13 touchdowns</a> in 2015, the New York Giants wideout took his game to new heights in his third NFL season.

Through the first 16 weeks of 2016, OBJ has 96 receptions, 1,323 receiving yards, and 10 touchdown receptions. If Beckham continues performing at this level, it's only a matter of time before his fans push him to the top of this list.

<h2>7. Antonio Brown, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_689834" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-689834" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Antonio-Brown-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Antonio Brown celebrates a touchdown | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images" width="757" height="493" /> Business is booming for Antonio Brown | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to Antonio Brown, business is always booming. The All-Pro wideout leads the NFL with 106 catches; he has amassed 1,284 receiving yards and 12 touchdown receptions; and he recently joined his third consecutive Pro Bowl team. Thanks to Brown's speed, style, and big-play ability, his jersey will always be a hot commodity.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Von Miller, LB, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_607846" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607846" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Von-Miller_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images2-640x436.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Von Miller gestures that the Denver Broncos are No. 1, at least to him | Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> Von Miller is one of the best in the game | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

The Denver Broncos won't get the chance to defend their Super Bowl crown, but it's hard to pin the blame on linebacker Von Miller. In 15 games this season, he's amassed 73 combined tackles, forced two fumbles, and generated 13.5 sacks. Not only is Miller one of the best players in the game today, but based on his jersey sales, he's clearly among the most popular.

<h2>5. Rob Gronkowski, TE, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_607678" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607678" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Rob-Gronkowski_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x469.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Rob Gronkowski holds onto the ball tightly | Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="555" /> Rob Gronkowski is loved by many | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

After suffering a season-ending back injury, it's safe to assume Rob Gronkowski wishes he could <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-wish-season-never-happened.html/">have a do-over in 2016</a>. Still, that doesn't change the fact the Patriots tight end, when healthy, is one of the most dominant players in the NFL. As long as Gronk continues to spike the pigskin at will, while entertaining fans with his one-of-a-kind personality, his jersey will remain a top seller.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Tom Brady, QB, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587032" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587032" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images1-640x461.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Tom Brady yells after a touchdown pass | Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="546" /> Tom Brady has looked unstoppable | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Tom Brady is the face of the New England Patriots and quite possibly the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/">greatest quarterback in NFL history</a>. All he's done since returning from his four-game suspension is remind everyone of this. In 11 games this season, Gisele's husband has completed 66.7% of his passes; he has thrown for 3,278 yards, 25 touchdowns and two interceptions; and he looks determined to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-vegas-picking-win-2016-mvp-award.html/">add more individual hardware to his trophy case</a>. It's safe to say that "No. 12" isn't going out of style anytime soon

<h2>3. Carson Wentz, QB, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696665" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696665" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Carson-Wentz_Rich-Schultz_Getty-Images-640x449.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Carson Wentz looks for a target | Rich Schultz/Getty Images" width="757" height="532" /> Carson Wentz doesn't play like a rookie | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

Many scoffed -- <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-why-the-eagles-were-smart-to-trade-for-no-2.html/">not us</a> -- when the Philadelphia Eagles traded away a boatload of picks to move up to the No. 2 spot in the 2016 draft in order to select a quarterback from North Dakota State. Looks like the joke's on them. While Carson Wentz hasn't been perfect in his rookie season, he continues to command the offense like a seasoned veteran. Thanks to his undeniable skill-set, he has the Philly faithful feeling good about the franchise's future. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/philly-fans-carson-wentz-wagon.html/">Wentz wagon</a> has officially left the station; hurry up, you don't want to miss it.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Dak Prescott, QB, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725200" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725200" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dak-Prescott__Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Dak Prescott runs downfield | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Dak Prescott has the Cowboys rolling | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

A team did not select quarterback Dak Prescott until the fourth round of the 2016 draft, but he's a major reason why the Dallas Cowboys are the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-dallas-cowboys-are-the-team-to-beat-in-nfc.html/">team to beat in the NFC</a>. The Mississippi State signal caller has a 13-2 record as a starter, is <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PresDa01.htm">completing 68.1% of his passes</a> and has thrown for 3,630 yards, 23 touchdowns, and four interceptions (while rushing for another six scores).

Most importantly, Prescott has led the Cowboys to an NFC crown and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. As crazy as it sounds, there is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/tony-romo-showed-that-one-man-is-not-bigger-than-the-team.html/">no quarterback controversy in the Big D</a>; Tony Romo is out, and the rookie is in. Don't expect that to change anytime soon.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_721246" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-721246" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ezekiel-Elliott_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="One of the players with the highest-selling jerseys, Ezekiel Elliott is okay with his touchdown | Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="528" /> Ezekiel Elliott has given the Cowboys plenty to cheer about in 2016 | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Ezekiel Elliott may be a rookie, but luckily for the Dallas Cowboys, he does not play like one. The former Ohio State standout is averaging 108.7 rushing yards per game (tops <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/ElliEz00.htm">in the NFL</a>), leads the league in rushing with 1,631 yards on the ground, and has 15 rushing touchdowns. Zeke's a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ezekiel-elliott-nfl-mvp-candidate.html/">legitimate MVP candidate</a> and one of the most exciting young players in the game today. If you planned on buying a No. 21 Cowboys jersey, we suggest you hurry. From the looks of it, there might not be many left in stock.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_518952" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-518952" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lewis-Sean-Brady-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Baltimore Ravens' Jamal Lewis in action against the Pittsburgh Steelers." width="757" height="505" /> Baltimore Ravens' Jamal Lewis in action against the Pittsburgh Steelers | Sean Brady/NFLPhotoLibrary/Getty Images[/caption]

Mastering the NFL regular season and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-teams-that-made-the-playoffs-with-a-losing-record.html/">punching a ticket to the playoffs</a> is hard enough. Maintaining a high level of play against the league’s toughest in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/">pursuit of a Super Bowl berth</a> is even less of a cake walk. Doing all that as an NFL wild card that must play all of their games on the road? Now, that takes some serious skill.

The Pittsburgh Steelers find themselves in this situation heading into next weekend, as they visit Foxborough, Mass. to play the Patriots <a href="http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/01/16/pittsburgh-steelers-team-grades-steelers-hold-on-to-upset-chiefs-advance-to-afc-championship/">after narrowly defeating</a> the Kansas City Chiefs 18-16.

This isn’t to say Mike Tomlin’s Steelers don't have what it takes to go toe-to-toe with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-players-bill-belichick-sent-packing.html/">Bill Belichick’s Patriots</a> next Sunday. In fact, six such wild-card teams from past seasons went on to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-super-bowl-blowouts-nfl-history.html/">hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy</a> since the league introduced the wild-card game in 1978. Maybe the Steelers have a better shot than meets the eye?

These six wild-card teams won the Super Bowl.

<h2>1. 1980 Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505258" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505258" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Raiders-Todd-Christensen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tight end Todd Christensen of the Los Angeles Raiders runs the ball." width="757" height="504" /> Tight end Todd Christensen of the Los Angeles Raiders runs the ball | George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

The Silver &amp; Black made history as the first team to make it to the Super Bowl after the NFL’s playoff system expanded. They also did it in high fashion, defying odds after losing their starting quarterback early in the season.

At 2-3 to start the campaign, Oakland lost Dan Pastorini to a broken leg. But they rallied behind 33-year-old quarterback <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/jim-plunkett-explains-how-connor-cook-can-succeed-in-playoffs/">Jim Plunkett </a>to emerge 11-5 on the regular season <span class="s1">-- </span>just like the Steelers did this season <span class="s1">-- </span>and earn a wild<span class="s1">-c</span>ard berth. Then the Raiders won back-to-back road games to make it to the Super Bowl, which <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-worst-teams-to-win-a-super-bowl.html/">ended in victory</a>.

<h2>2. 1997 Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505262" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505262" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Broncos-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Denver Broncos celebrate a win." width="757" height="515" /> The Denver Broncos celebrate a win | Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Unlike the 1980 Raiders, this <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/winningest-franchises-pro-sports.html/">Broncos team</a> was a dominant force. They went 12-4 on the regular season with John Elway captaining the ship. Denver only played in the wild-card round because the Chiefs took the AFC West title.

After a convincing wild-card victory (42-17<span class="s1">) </span>over the Jaguars, the Broncos continued their push to the Super Bowl. But their confident ground game, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-records-single-season-rushing-yards-leaders.html/">courtesy of running back Terrell Davis</a>, helped them rally to take down the Green Bay Packers 31-24 and win Super Bowl XXXIII.

<h2>3. 2000 Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505267" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505267" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Baltimore-Ravens-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The Baltimore Ravens celebrate a win." width="757" height="535" /> The Baltimore Ravens celebrate a win | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

This Ravens team might be one of the “<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-worst-teams-to-win-a-super-bowl.html/">worst teams to win a Super Bowl</a>.” By “worst,” we just mean that they “weren’t that great.” For this Raven's team, "weren't that great" is the best way to describe the offense -- well, outside of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-nfl-tight-ends-of-all%C2%AD-time.html/">tight end Shannon Sharpe</a>.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/strongest-nfl-defenses-in-history.html/">notorious defense</a>, on the other hand, was stellar. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-top-5-baltimore-ravens-of-all-time.html/">Ray Lewis-led</a> D-corp only allowed five rushing touchdowns all season and allowed 60.6 rushing yards per game and 165 points all season; both are NFL records for a 16-game campaign. It was their counter-attack that catapulted the Ravens through this championship-winning playoff run.

Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

The 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 Steelers had the luxury of playing on their home turf after winning their wild-card battle. But that was not the case for the 2005 team; they had to rattle off three straight wins on the road. The feat was even more difficult because the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-pittsburgh-steelers-of-all-time.html/">Steelers</a> sat at 7-5 through Week 12.

With a little help from the opposing Colts, as well as Indianapolis's kicker <a href="http://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/2010/9/7/1525167/2-steelers-21-colts-18-2005-top-12">having a meltdown</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-teams-didnt-win-super-bowl.html/">Hines Ward and company</a> made their way to the Super Bowl to upset the favored Seattle Seahawks 21-10.

<h2>5. 2007 New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505269" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505269" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Giants-Gabriel-Bouys-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Eli Manning screams as he wins the Super Bowl." width="757" height="554" /> Eli Manning yells as he wins the Super Bowl | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Of the two Giants teams that defeated the New England Patriots in closely-timed <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-tale-of-every-super-bowl-halftime-show-since-2006.html/">Super Bowls</a>, the 2007 version was probably the most surprising. Not just because New York went up against a Tom Brady-led Pats team with a perfect record, but also because this Giants squad <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-worst-teams-to-win-a-super-bowl.html/?a=viewall">wasn't expected to survive the playoffs. </a>

After a modest 10-6 regular season New York defeated the Buccaneers to escape the wild-card round. Then they won their next two games by a combined seven points. Then, after being down 7-3 at halftime in the Super Bowl, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-new-york-giants-of-all-time.html/">Eli Manning</a>’s Giants <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-sports-upsets-of-all-time.html/">totaled 14 points in the fourth quarter</a> to keep the Patriots from achieving a perfect season record.

<h2>6. 2010 Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505270" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-505270" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Packers-Timothy-A.-Clary-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers holds the Lombardi Trophy after winning the Super Bowl." width="757" height="539" /> Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers is the epitome of a leader for this successful franchise | Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

If there’s one thing the current Steelers don’t want to remember, it's the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/green-bay-packers-best-fans-nfl.html/">Green Bay Packers</a>’ wild-card team from 2010, which beat them in the Super Bowl. At the time, many weren’t familiar with the Packers defense, which featured <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-retirements-2016.html/">veteran Charles Woodson</a> and a young long-haired linebacker by the name of Clay Matthews. And Aaron Rodgers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-stats-greats.html/">wasn’t a household name yet</a> <span class="s1">-- </span>despite the debut of his witty commercials, he still worked in the shadow of Brett Favre.

But after going 10-6 on the regular season, wild-card Green Bay caught fire and rolled through three road games on their way to the Super Bowl. They defeated the Steelers in a raucous bout, 31-25.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_698738" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-698738" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Cam-Newton-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="464" /> Cam Newton (R) is a superstar | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

As nice as it feels to be liked by the masses, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">NFL</a> is not a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-highest-selling-jerseys-2016.html/">popularity contest</a>. Many of today's top players would rather be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-players-no-one-likes-great.html/">respected as great talents</a> than be adored for being pleasant individuals. Of course, when it comes to earning massive paychecks as the highest-paid NFL players, it never hurts to be a hit both on and off the field.

Although the average salary in the National Football League is $2.1 million, according to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2016/09/14/the-nfls-highest-paid-players-2016/#a62a1c7713aa">fine folks at Forbes</a>, the 15 players at the top of the financial food chain combined to make $535 million in salary, bonuses, and endorsement money during the past year. In case you wonder how this figure is calculated, take a look at Forbes' methodology:
<blockquote>Our earnings figures consider salary and bonuses (signing, roster, option, playoff and workout) earned between June 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. They also include estimated earnings from endorsements, appearances and licensing money paid by the NFL Players Association. Our June cutoff means we did not include players with new contracts signed over the summer like Luck ($139.1 million), Von Miller ($114.5 million) and Fletcher Cox ($102.6 million).</blockquote>
In the end, of course, all anyone cares about is which players came out on top. With that in mind, here's a look at the 15 highest-paid NFL players in 2016.

<h2>15. Trent Williams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_572653" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572653" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Trent-Williams-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-640x441.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="521" /> You can't keep Trent Williams down for long | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $25.6 million

Since the Washington Redskins selected Trent Williams with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, he quickly emerged as one of the top left tackles in the game today. The former Oklahoma Sooner has earned four consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl. He was <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/13539226/trent-williams-agrees-5-year-66m-extension-washington-redksins-agent-says">handsomely rewarded</a> to protect the blind side, and according to Forbes, was the 15th highest-paid NFL player over the past year with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/15-trent-williams/#fdc5845faad5">$25.6 million in total earnings</a>. Given this information, the above picture is clearly not Williams' reaction to his most recent bank statement.

<h2>14. Cameron Jordan</h2>
[caption id="attachment_645480" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-645480" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cameron-Jordan_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-640x444.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="526" /> Cameron Jordan is a force on the gridiron | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $25.9 million

Now in his sixth NFL season, all with the New Orleans Saints, defensive end Cameron Jordan has amassed 40 sacks, recovered eight fumbles, and made two separate trips (2013 and 2015) to the Pro Bowl. For his efforts, the Saints rewarded the former Cal Bear with a <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-orleans-saints/cameron-jordan-7739/">five-year, $55 million contract</a> that runs through the 2020 season. While Jordan has <em>only</em> earned $100,000 in endorsements this past year, when you've managed to collect <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/14-cameron-jordan/#7ae52361261c">$25.8 million in salary and bonuses</a>, you can afford to let the little things slide.

<h2>13. Luke Kuechly</h2>
[caption id="attachment_607851" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607851" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Luke-Kuechly_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-640x440.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="520" /> Luke Kuechly earns his paycheck | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $27.1 million

The Carolina Panthers know full well what kind of player they have in Luke Kuechly, which is why they had no problem rewarding him with a five-year, $62 million deal back in 2015. Of course, when you're arguably the best inside linebacker in the game, as evidenced by three trips to the Pro Bowl and three First-Team All-Pro selections since 2012, not only do you make money for your work on the field (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/13-luke-kuechly/#45ed4af827a7">$26.1 million in salary and bonuses</a>), you also earn coin from endorsement opportunities ($1 million in the last year) with companies like Nike and Pepsi among others.

<h2>12. Julio Jones</h2>
[caption id="attachment_607677" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607677" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Julio-Jones_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-638x500.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="593" /> You can't stop Julio Jones | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $27.2 million

In 2015, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones had the best season of his career. He led the NFL in receptions (136), receiving yards (1,871), and yards per game (116.9); earned his third career trip to the Pro Bowl, and received First-Team All-Pro honors. As far as his total haul (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/12-julio-jones/#b06f2ba1ae98">$27.2 million</a>) over the last year is concerned, it's safe to say he more than earned it.

<h2>11. Olivier Vernon</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $29 million

Don't let the above picture fool you, Olivier Vernon is no longer with the Miami Dolphins, as the defensive end signed with the New York Giants this past offseason for a cool <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000642916/article/olivier-vernon-to-sign-85-million-deal-with-giants">$85 million over fives years</a>. The real joke, however, is that the former Miami Hurricanes star has banked $29 million in the last year without ever having made a Pro Bowl or received All-NFL honors. Yeah, this is us laughing.

<h2>10. Drew Brees</h2>
[caption id="attachment_667479" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-667479" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Drew-Brees_Jamie-Sabau_Getty-Images-640x463.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="548" /> Drew Brees amasses more than just passing yards | Jamie Sabau/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $31 million

Quarterback Drew Brees would've been higher on this list, however, his recent two-year, $44.25 million extension occurred after Forbes' earnings time period. No matter, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/">future Hall of Famer</a> still banked $19 million in salary and bonuses and pulled in another $12 million in endorsements from companies like Nike, Wrangler, and Microsoft, making him No. 10 on the list of the NFL's highest-paid players in 2016. You go, Drew Brees.

<h2>9. A.J. Green</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675947" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675947" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/A.J.-Green-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> A.J. Green gets paid handsomely for his services | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $33.3 million

Although the Cincinnati Bengals are known for coming up short at crunch time, it's hard to place any of that blame on star wideout A.J. Green. Since coming into the league in 2011, the former Georgia Bulldog has amassed over 6,000 receiving yards, caught almost 50 touchdowns, and earned five trips to the Pro Bowl. In the last year, Green pulled in $32.8 million in salary and bonuses and produced <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/9-aj-green/#4a4fce23692f">$33.3 million in total earnings</a>. Next up (hopefully), a victory in the postseason.

<h2>8. Peyton Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696659" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696659" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Peyton-Manning_Justin-Edmonds_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> The NFL will never see another Peyton Manning | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $34.2 million

Although the great Peyton Manning called it a career prior to the start of the 2016 season, given the time period used by Forbes for its earnings calculations, he easily secured a spot on this particular list. From June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2016, Manning amassed $34.2 million in total earnings, courtesy of $19.2 million in salary and bonuses and $15 million in endorsements. Any way you slice it, there will never be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-peyton-manning.html/">another player like him</a>.

<h2>7. Marcell Dareus</h2>
[caption id="attachment_698726" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-698726" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Marcell-Dareus-Al-Messerschmidt-Getty-Images-e1474303576506.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="606" /> Marcell Dareus is pumped | Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $35.2 million

In spite of being suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season, Buffalo's Marcell Dareus is still the highest-earning defensive player in 2016. The Buffalo Bills' two-time Pro Bowler has raked in $35.1 million in salary and bonuses while collecting a whopping <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/7-marcell-dareus/#41d8e9621669">$35.2 million in total earnings</a>. If only this money could help the Bills put a winning team out on the field... Now that would be something.

<h2>6. Philip Rivers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_575461" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-575461" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Philip-Rivers_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Philip Rivers should be pumped | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $38 million

Philip Rivers might not have the prettiest release in the NFL, but he's easily one of the toughest and most reliable quarterbacks in all of football. For this reason, along with the fact that he consistently throws for over 4,000 yards a season, Rivers is paid quite handsomely; he earned <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/6-philip-rivers/#4e41f7bb1c18">$37.5 million in salary and bonuses</a> over the past year. Considering some of his top targets are lost for the 2016 season on account of injuries, Rivers better be prepared to earn his paycheck and then some.

<h2>5. Russell Wilson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_536361" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-536361 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Russell-Wilson1.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="540" /> Russell Wilson is cashing in on and off the field | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $41.8 million

Russell Wilson may have had to wait until the third round (No. 75 overall) of the 2012 draft to hear his name called, but the Seattle Seahawks quarterback has quickly emerged as one of the most valuable players -- both on and off the field -- in the National Football League. Aside from the $31.8 million he's earning from his salary and bonuses, Wilson, through sponsorships with with companies like Nike, Bose, Braun, and Microsoft, has netted $10 million endorsement money over the last year. We <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-no-one-likes-russell-wilson-anymore.html/">may get sick of him</a> at times, but based on these figures, clearly not everyone feels the same way.

<h2>4. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_670914" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-670914" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="558" /> It's good to be Tom Brady | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $44.1 million

Suspension or not, this is still Tom Brady's world and we're all just living in it. As one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game, No. 12 earned <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/4-tom-brady/#3135d6f251f9">$36.1 million in salary and bonuses</a> to go along with an impressive $8 million in endorsement money. He may not top the highest-paid NFL players list, but there are very few people out there who have it as good as the New England Patriots superstar.

<h2>3. Joe Flacco</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660652" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660652" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Flacco_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-593x500.jpg" alt="15 Highest-Paid NFL Players in 2016" width="757" height="639" /> Joe Flacco for the win | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $44.5 million

Didn't see this one coming? It's cool, we forgive you. Although Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco only earned $500,000 in endorsements, thanks to his recent three-year deal -- one that netted him a $40 million signing bonus, the former Super Bowl MVP is looking at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/3-joe-flacco/#3d98c3017f61">$44.5 million in total earnings</a> in the last year. Yeah, we're pretty jealous too.

<h2>2. Eli Manning</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $45 million

As much as we like to make fun of Eli Manning's face (he brings it on himself), there's nothing funny about the amount of money he earns on a regular basis. In the last year, Eli collected $8 million from endorsements and took home another <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/2-eli-manning/#647c46b013a9">$37 million in salary and bonuses</a>. Simply put, Peyton's younger brother is swimming in Scrooge McDuck money.

<h2>1. Cam Newton</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Total earnings</span>: $53.1 million

This one wasn't even close. From June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2016, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton made $12 million in endorsements and added another $41.1 million in salary bonuses, making him the highest-paid NFL player in 2016 with a ridiculous <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fghkj/1-cam-newton/#19213ac40658">$53.1 million in total earnings</a>. At this moment in time, the reigning MVP may very well be the face of the National Football League. Of course, if you ask us, the only way he'll ever reach legendary status is by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-now-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/">winning a Super Bowl</a>, but we'll leave that discussion for another day.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_584505" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584505" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/NFL_Doug-Pensinger_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> On on field view of the uprights and NFL logo at Sports Authority Field. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Considering the competing factors that affect any sort of decision about where professional athletes would prefer to play throughout their given sport, the first measurables usually lean toward things like state tax, the local weather, and the local advantages of being famous in a given area — all those play into the ‘big market advantage’ that free agents are often said to be weighing their options against. While the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> is spared a lot of that discussion, since player movement is so stunted, especially among stars, it doesn’t mean that those sorts of considerations don’t hold some weight.

It is also true, though, that players typically don’t want to play for bad teams, and some of these teams, compiled from information from ESPN’s annual NFL poll, are certainly bad teams. Some of them, though, are not, and don’t seem like the fill-in answers to the statement, “The only way I’d play for ____ is if they doubled my salary.” That said, anonymity makes for free and easy responses, and the eighty-two players that answered incognito (although not Richie, we assume) let fly on which teams wouldn’t be able to woo them assuming equal salaries.

Of course, it’s important to keep in mind that this constitutes a small spectrum, or a representative sample, if you buy the findings, of the NFL populous, and that the respondents constitute roughly a team and a half’s worth of players. That’s something that should be noted. On the other hand, we’re not totally shocked.
<h2><!--nextpage-->5. Green Bay Packers — 6%</h2>
[caption id="attachment_596615" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-596615" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Randall-Cobb-Jennifer-Stewart-Getty-Images1-640x426.jpg" alt="Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Green Bay's Randall Cobb is tackled. | Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

Even after figuring that the cold weather and general nothingness that is Wisconsin has got to play into these votes, the Packers have got to be one of the more surprising teams on this list, since they haven’t had a losing season since 2008, although they just barely missed .500 in 2013, finishing with eight wins, seven losses, and a tie. They’ve also got <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/forget-seattle-and-the-12th-man-here-are-the-nfls-5-best-fanbases.html/" target="_blank">the most loyal fans in the NFL</a>, so it’s not as if the Cheeseheads aren’t coming out and showing their love. Maybe the players who voted for Green Bay are lactose intolerant, or maybe they’ve been forced out on Lambeau in the middle of December and realized that they’d never want to do it more often than they absolutely have to.

<h2>4. Jacksonville Jaguars — 9%</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672381" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672381" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Denard-Robinson-Jacksonville-Jaguars.jpg" alt="JACKSONVILLE, FL - DECEMBER 13: Denard Robinson #16 of the Jacksonville Jaguars smiles after a reception and first down during the game against the Indianapolis Colts at EverBank Field on December 13, 2015 in Jacksonville, Florida.

Surprisingly low ranking for the Jaguars, who haven’t been able to put together a winning season since George Bush was president — George W. Bush, that is. That’s just kind of a bummer, since they’ve got a swimming pool in their stadium now. Which begs the question: How awesome would it be if any overtime that happened at a Jacksonville home game had to happen in the pool? Come on, that would be awesome. You would watch. We would watch.

The Jags position on this list does illustrate one of the conundrums with being a bad team, even in a league that has such an emphasis on parity and has seen team after team turn it all around. How do you bring in the missing piece if the missing piece is convinced that your team kind of sucks and doesn’t want to play there? Let’s keep this question in mind.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Cleveland Browns — 16%</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621777" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621777" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cleveland-Browns-Fans_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x423.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="500" /> Cleveland Browns fans show their frustration. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Cleveland is kind of like Jacksonville without the swimming pool, but don’t take our word for it, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilver/statuses/417434011552587777" target="_blank">take the word of someone who actually plays for them</a>, “We are so dysfunctional. These billionaires need to pick somebody and stay with them. These aren’t girlfriends… you can’t dump them if they (fail to please you) one time.” The second tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilver/statuses/417434074920140801" target="_blank">is here</a>.

The ‘these’ our intrepid, and frustrated, player is referring to is a coach, as those quotes were obtained right after the Browns fired Rob Chudzinski. The Browns go through coaches, well, like professional athletes go through girlfriends, apparently.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Buffalo Bills — 19%</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675920" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675920" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/LeSean-McCoy-Tom-Szczerbowski-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ORCHARD PARK, NY - DECEMBER 06: LeSean McCoy #25 of the Buffalo Bills hurdles Kareem Jackson #25 of the Houston Texans during the second half at Ralph Wilson Stadium on December 6, 2015 in Orchard Park, New York.

Take the icy permafrost of Lambeau, take away the winning, and you have the Buffalo Bills. Take away the winning might be a kind way to put it, actually, since the Bills have only been able to put together one positive season in the last thirteen years. It seems safe to conclude that when you’re most famous for losing consecutive Super Bowls, players might not have the most faith in your organization’s ability to be awesome.

<h2>1. Oakland Raiders — 23%</h2>
[caption id="attachment_562527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-562527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Aldon-Smith-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Aldon Smith warms up for the Raiders. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Skeletor is not having a good time. His team could leave for Los Angeles or San Antonio (or even Las Vegas). When ESPN<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11405668/nfl-nation-confidential-oakland-raiders-least-desirable-team-play-for" target="_blank"> first reported</a> the results of the poll, Oakland fullback Marcell Reese was not on board.

“Whoever said it, they’re telling a lie. They didn’t think about it. They thought about the one team that has the biggest stigma of negativity around them,” Reese said. “And it’s not really a negative thing because we don’t do bad things. We’re not the team that’s having the most arrests in the NFL, or the DUIs or the drug cases or throwing the big parties. But we just have that stigma around us.”

Another player, who plays for another team and was speaking anonymously, told ESPN that the assessment was correct, because “It’s true. They’ve got a bunch of players who got double their salary.” Zing. Things are looking up since the arrival of Amari Cooper and Derek Carr, but Oakland has yet to become a true destination for NFL players.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_725740" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725740" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ezekiel-Elliott_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott gestures to the refs about a call." width="757" height="504" /> The Dallas Cowboys have what it takes to win Super Bowl 51 | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-dallas-cowboys-players-ever.html/" target="_blank">Dallas Cowboys</a> are arguably the most polarizing franchise in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>. And really, it's easy to see why. "America's Team" has a massive, loyal fanbase. They're also the most hated team in the NFL outside of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/reasons-patriots-win-super-bowl-51.html/" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a>. Last year (2015), <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/you-wont-believe-where-vegas-thinks-tony-romo-will-play-2017.html/">injuries to key players</a> made Dallas one of the biggest laughingstocks in all of professional sports. This season, the Cowboys are taking the league by storm. They entered the postseason with the second-best record in the NFL (13-3), and now control their own championship destiny.

The vast majority of their success can be attributed to owner/General Manager Jerry Jones wisely (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/jerry-jones-will-ruin-dallas-cowboys-season.html/" target="_blank">and uncharacteristically</a>) listening to his personnel executives and scouts (led by his son, Stephen) when it came to assembling the team's roster. As a direct result, the Cowboys now have arguably the best (and definitely the most balanced) offense in the NFL <span class="s1">-- </span>all built through the NFL draft.

Since the 2010 NFL Draft, Dallas has landed three perennial All-Pro offensive linemen and an All-Pro wide receiver (left tackle Tyron Smith, center Travis Frederick, right guard Zack Martin, and Dez Bryant). In the 2016 draft, the Cowboys hit the jackpot twice; they selected running back Ezekiel Elliott (first round) and quarterback Dak Prescott (fourth round). Both are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-vegas-picking-win-2016-mvp-award.html/">NFL MVP and Offensive Rookie of the Year candidates</a> in 2016.

Despite their success during the 2016 regular season, not everyone is convinced that Dallas is a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dallas-cowboys-super-bowl-contenders.html/" target="_blank">legitimate world championship contender</a>. However, there are 10 reasons why the Dallas Cowboys can win Super Bowl 51 this coming February.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. They have the best offensive line in the NFL</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725711" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725711" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tyron-Smith_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-1024x758.jpg" alt="Tyron Smith gets into his stance before a play." width="757" height="560" /> Tyron Smith is one of the premier left tackles in the NFL | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Elliott and Prescott <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-players-under-25-years-old.html/">dominate the headlines</a>. However, neither player would be where they are in their respective rookie seasons without the play of the Dallas offensive line. In fact, these unsung heroes are so outstanding that they're now mentioned as a potential candidate to <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/dak-zeke-no-the-cowboys-offensive-line-should-win-nfl-mvp-and-yes-its-possible-111316" target="_blank">win the 2016 NFL MVP award as a group</a>.

While that likely won't happen (even though technically it is allowed), Travis Frederick, Tyron Smith, and Zack Martin all earned first-team All-Pro honors for the 2016 season. What's even crazier about the Cowboys' play up front is the fact that they lacked second-year guard La'el Collins for most of the season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. They consistently dominate the time of possession battle</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725727" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725727" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ezekiel-Dak_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images-1024x717.jpg" alt="Dak Prescott hands the ball off to Ezekiel Elliott." width="757" height="530" /> The Dallas Cowboys rushing attack is winning them games | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

History proves that winning the time of possession battle almost always equates to success in the NFL. In 2016, the Dallas Cowboys rank third in <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/average-time-of-possession-net-of-ot" target="_blank">the league with an average time of possession</a> of 31:27 per game. By consistently winning this facet of the game, the Cowboys help their defense stay fresh by keeping them off the field while wearing down opposing defenses.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Ezekiel Elliott is arguably the best running back in the NFL</h2>
[caption id="attachment_715273" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-715273" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ezekiel-Elliott-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott dodges his opponent while he grips the ball." width="757" height="504" /> Ezekiel Elliott is a beast | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

At the very least, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-with-highest-selling-jerseys-2016.html/">Elliott</a> is one of the top three running backs in the league today (joined by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/underpaid-nfl-players-who-deserve-a-massive-pay-raise.html/">David Johnson</a> of the Arizona Cardinals and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-leveon-bell-is-making-nfl-history.html/">Le'Veon Bell</a> of the Pittsburgh Steelers). The former Ohio State Buckeye led the league in rushing yards during the regular season, earning first-team All-Pro honors along the way. If he remains healthy, "Zeke" is the type of back who can carry his team to a championship.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Dak Prescott is at his best in critical situations</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725729" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725729" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dak-Prescott_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x734.jpg" alt="Dak Prescott smiles as he walks off the field after a win." width="757" height="543" /> Dak Prescott continues to come up big in clutch situations | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/whats-next-for-tony-romo-dak-prescott-and-dallas-cowboys.html/">Tony Romo era is over</a>. The Dallas Cowboys are now <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dak-prescott-vs-tony-romo-dallas-cowboys.html/" target="_blank">Prescott's team</a>.

The rookie out of Mississippi State is a perfect fit for Dallas's offense. He's played at an elite level since literally his first NFL preseason game. As a direct result, Prescott's teammates already respect him. He came up with clutch performances on multiple occasions during the regular season, and it is quickly becoming clear that he has the "it" factor that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/wentz-dak-history-top-rookie-qbs.html/">few other NFL quarterbacks possess</a>. Bottom line: The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-quarterbacks-next-tom-brady.html/">Cowboys struck gold</a> when they took Prescott in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Their defense is substantially better in 2016</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sean-Lee_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Sean Lee talks to the defense between plays." width="757" height="505" /> Sean Lee and the Cowboys defense have played at a high level in 2016 | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

The Dallas Cowboys were flat-out awful on the defensive side of the ball in 2015. But this year is a completely different story. Entering the playoffs, Dallas ranked 14th in the league in total defense; first in the league in rushing yards allowed per game; and fifth in the league in points allowed per game.

We directly attribute the Cowboys' defensive turnaround to their offense. Their offensive dominance allows their defense to stay healthy and regularly play with a lead (which, for those who don't know, is a huge advantage). While we can't confuse their defense with those of the Denver Broncos or Seattle Seahawks, it's good enough for the Cowboys to make a deep postseason run.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. They don't turn the ball over</h2>
[caption id="attachment_696775" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-696775" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ezekiel-Elliott_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott smiles and holds the ball to his chest after a successful catch." width="757" height="505" /> Ezekiel Elliott has lost only one fumble in 2016 | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Turning the ball over is one of the quickest and easiest ways to lose games in the NFL. In fact, if you look the NFL's current turnover differential stats, you will find a direct correlation between how well a team performs in this area and their overall record. During the 2016 regular season, the Cowboys turned the ball over only 15 times.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. They own the No. 1 seed in the NFC Playoffs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_725738" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725738" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Dez-Bryant_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Dez Bryant pumps up the crowd during a game." width="757" height="505" /> The Cowboys have a very favorable schedule going forward | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Before the 2016 season even started, we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-favorable-schedules-season.html/" target="_blank">had a pretty good idea</a> that the Cowboys had one of the easier schedules in the league. However, to their credit, they took care of business week in and week out on their way to clinching home<span class="s1">-</span>field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs.

Dallas will have a couple tough tests over the next month, but the Cowboys will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/">likely be the Vegas favorites</a> in all of their remaining games. When it's all said and done, having the distinct advantage of playing all of their playoff games at home could be enough to ensure Dallas represents the NFC in Super Bowl 51.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. They are healthy</h2>
[caption id="attachment_727257" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-727257" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tony-RomoRonald-MartinezGetty-Images-1024x715.jpg" alt="Tony Romo watches from the sidelines." width="757" height="529" /> Tony Romo is healthy enough to play if the Cowboys need him | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

For the first time in a long time the Cowboys will enter a game at full strength (or close to it). And it couldn't have happened at a better time. Linebacker Sean Lee is healthy and playing at an All-Pro level; <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dez-bryant/">Bryant</a> is back to being one of the most explosive wide receivers in the league; their outstanding offensive line is completely in tact; Morris Claiborne is set to return to their secondary after missing nearly two months; <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-wish-season-never-happened.html/">Romo is healthy</a> and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-5-undrafted-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/">ready to play</a> if need be; and running back Elliott shows no signs of wear and tear.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. They excel on third down</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743305" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743305" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dak-Prescott-Ezekiel-Elliott_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-1024x652.jpg" alt="Ezekiel Elliott congratulates his teammate after a play." width="757" height="482" /> The Cowboys have been highly successful on third downs | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

NFL coaches often refer to third down as the "money down." Games can be won and lost based on third down performance, and players can earn a reputation for being a clutch performer by consistently producing big plays during third down situations. In 2016, the Cowboys rank ninth in the league in offensive third down conversions (42.3%) and 15th in the league in third down defensive stops (39.1%).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. They have outstanding kicking specialists</h2>
[caption id="attachment_697369" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-697369" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dan-Bailey_Otto-Greule-Jr.Getty-Images-1024x791.jpg" alt="Dan Bailey kicks a field goal for the Dallas Cowboys." width="757" height="585" /> Dan Bailey is nearly automatic | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

History proves that having a clutch kicker and/or a punter who can flip the field or completely take away a dangerous punt returner are invaluable assets during the NFL postseason. The Dallas Cowboys have both. Dan Bailey is a near-automatic kicker, and Chris Jones is one of the most consistent <span class="s1">-- </span>and underrated <span class="s1">-- </span>punters in the league.

It's easy to look at offensive outbursts in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">National Football League</a>, especially during these Fantasy-driven times, and focus solely on which players rack up the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/vegas-picking-lead-nfl-touchdowns-2016.html/">most touchdowns</a>, yet that wouldn't be doing the game's biggest superstars justice. While some individuals may not get into the end zone as much as others, that doesn't mean they aren't able to singlehandedly take over the contest. And the way we see it, few individuals manage to do this better than wideout Julio Jones.

During Atlanta's <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201610020atl.htm">48-33</a> dismantling of the Carolina Panthers in Week 4, the Falcons receiver was an absolute one-man wrecking crew, catching 12 passes, including one for a touchdown, while racking up a <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17696419/julio-jones-sets-atlanta-falcons-mark-300-yard-game">ridiculous 300 receiving yards</a>. Leave it to Jones, however, to remain beyond humble in the face of his latest outstanding performance: "It's just for my brothers. We have a brotherhood here. We worked the whole offseason to create that. My success today is from them, just being out on the field with them.''

As much as we appreciate a player's modesty, we feel the need to brag on Jones' behalf. After all, it's not everyday a player goes for 300-plus yards in a single game. In fact, this is just the sixth time in NFL history that it's been accomplished. You see, this is a big deal.

Of course, it should be noted that while Jones' mark put him in some pretty distinguished company, it wasn't good enough, from a receiving standpoint, to crack the top five of single-game performances. How is that possible? Take a look at the five players with the most single-game receiving yards in NFL history and see for yourself.

<h2>5. Cloyce Box, Detroit Lions</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AZZIkChFuI"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Receiving yards</span>: 302

On <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/195012030bcl.htm" target="_blank">December 3, 1950</a>, the Detroit Lions went on the road to take on the Baltimore Colts. In this monumentally one-sided affair that saw the visiting Lions come out victorious 45-21, the real star of the game proved to be wide receiver Cloyce Box. On this particular afternoon, the 6-foot-4-inch, 220-pound All-Pro used his massive frame to dominate the Colts to the tune of 12 receptions, 302 receiving yards, and four touchdowns. It’s hard to believe a performance that strong only constitutes the fifth-best single-game receiving output in NFL history.

<h2>4. Jim Benton, Cleveland Rams</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbJs9LLgFyA"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Receiving yards</span>: 303

Cleveland Rams receiver Jim Benton had a field day against the Detroit Lions on <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/194511220det.htm" target="_blank">November 22, 1945</a>. In a contest that saw the Rams improve to 9-1 following a 28-21 victory, the former Arkansas Razorbacks standout torched the Lions for 303 receiving yards and a touchdown. Interestingly enough, Benton played in just nine games that season, yet he led the league in receiving yards with 1,067.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Receiving yards</span>: 309

During a Week 16 clash on <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198512220kan.htm" target="_blank">December 22, 1985</a> between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Diego Chargers, KC wideout Stephone Paige took it upon himself to singlehandedly destroy the opposition. While the final score of the contest would read 38-34 in favor of the Chiefs, the Chargers proved no match for No. 83 who had eight receptions for 309 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Considering that Paige led the NFL that year in yards-per-reception (21.9), we feel like San Diego should’ve seen this sort of outburst coming.

<h2>2. Calvin Johnson, Detroit Lions</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Receiving yards</span>: 329

On <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201310270det.htm" target="_blank">October 27, 2013</a>, during a contest against the Dallas Cowboys, wide receiver <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/">Calvin Johnson</a> showed the world why he’s rightfully nicknamed “Megatron." The Detroit Lions superstar was absolutely unstoppable, torching the Cowboys secondary for 14 catches, 329 receiving yards, and one score. To be fair, Johnson did lose a fumble that the afternoon. However, the Lions still held on to win the game 31-30. We choose to focus on the positives; like Johnson’s destruction of Dallas.

<h2>1. Flipper Anderson, Los Angeles Rams</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8514rVvPrc"></iframe>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Receiving yards</span>: 336

When the Los Angeles Rams traveled to New Orleans on <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198911260nor.htm" target="_blank">November 26, 1989</a> to take on the Saints, who could’ve guessed that receiver Flipper Anderson would put on a show for the ages. The Rams wideout had 15 catches for an <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_single_game.htm" target="_blank">NFL single-game record 336 receiving yards</a> and one touchdown. On top of this ridiculous individual performance, the Rams went on to win the game by a score of 20-17. We’d say this was a pretty good day all around for the road team.

		<description><![CDATA[Gus Bradley has finally run out of time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Here is a look at 5 potential replacements for the Jags in 2017.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_578376" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578376" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gus-Bradley_Sam-Greenwood_Getty-Images-1024x789.jpg" alt="5 Potential Head Coaches to Replace Gus Bradley of the Jacksonville Jaguars | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images" width="757" height="583" /> Gus Bradley is running out of time in Jacksonville | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

It's no secret that former Jacksonville Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley had <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-coaches-hot-seat-2016-season.html/" target="_blank">been on the hot seat</a> for most of the last two years. In reality, when you consider the "what have you done for me lately?" nature of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, more or less every fan had a moment when they were mildly shocked that the 50-year-old coach still has a job.

<a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=400874553" target="_blank">Bradley likely sealed his fate</a> during his recent, nationally televised game against the Tennessee Titans. His Jaguars team got thoroughly dominated and flat-out embarrassed by the Titans, who had the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-why-the-tennessee-titans-need-to-trade-the-no-1-pick.html/" target="_blank">worst record in the NFL</a> a year ago. The final score of the game, 36-22, does not indicate how badly Tennessee dismantled Bradley's team (thanks to a couple of meaningless <a href="http://www.todayspigskin.com/ffb/blake-bortles-greatest-garbage-time-quarterback/" target="_blank">garbage-time touchdowns</a>). What truly concerns us about the Jags' performance, though, was that they came out flat, unmotivated, and ill-prepared -- all of which can be traced back to poor coaching. As a direct result, the Jaguars finally fired Bradley after the 12th loss of the season, and  NFL fans will see a new head coach in Jacksonville <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/">for 2017</a>.

One name that <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/report-tom-coughlin-could-return-next-year-to-coach-the-jaguars/" target="_blank">people bring up</a> that we just don't see being a realistic possibility is Tom Coughlin. He led the New York Giants to two Super Bowl titles and served as the Jacksonville Jaguars head coach from 1995<span class="s1">–</span>2002 (he is the winningest coach in franchise history). However, it's hard to see him taking another job at 70 years old. With that, here is a look at five other potential head coaches for the Jacksonville Jaguars to bring in in an attempt to right the ship.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Kyle Shanahan, offensive coordinator, Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719468" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719468" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kyle-Shanahan_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="5 Potential Head Coaches to Replace Gus Bradley of the Jacksonville Jaguars | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Kyle Shanahan will be one of the hottest names on the coaching market next offseason | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

Kyle Shanahan, the son of two-time Super Bowl-winning head coach Mike Shanahan, is doing a phenomenal job with the Falcons' offense in 2016. It is a virtual guarantee that he will have multiple offers to be another team's head coach in 2017. Atlanta currently ranks No. 1 in the league in total offense and points per game. As a direct result, the Falcons are currently the heavy favorites to win the NFC South title this season.

The overall talent in Jacksonville will likely intrigue Shanahan. However, he, like so many other coaches, may not be convinced that Blake Bortles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/time-running-nfl-quarterbacks-save-jobs.html/">is the long-term answer</a> at the quarterback position. Seeing as how Shanahan will likely have several suitors next offseason, the Jacksonville Jaguars may have to give him freedom in making a decision on Bortles' future to have any chance at landing the 36-year-old coach.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Josh McDaniels, offensive coordinator, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_576681" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-576681" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Josh-McDaniels_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-1024x730.jpg" alt="5 Potential Head Coaches to Replace Gus Bradley of the Jacksonville Jaguars | Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="540" /> Josh McDaniels wants another chance at being an NFL head coach | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

If not for his terrible stint as the Denver Broncos' head coach, Josh McDaniels would likely be one of the most sought-after head coaching candidates in the league. The 40-year-old Canton, Ohio native has made it clear that he wants to be a head coach NFL again. Our guess is that McDaniels has matured and been humbled quite a bit since Denver fired him in 2010.

McDaniels will likely want to have input in personnel decisions to go along with his head coaching responsibilities, which may be something the Jacksonville Jaguars are unwilling to give him. Also notable: McDaniels can be selective when it comes to head-coaching opportunities due to his situation <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-vegas-picking-win-super-bowl-51.html/">in New England</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Matt Patricia, defensive coordinator, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719470" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719470" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Belichick-Matt-Patricia_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="5 Potential Head Coaches to Replace Gus Bradley of the Jacksonville Jaguars | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Matt Patricia has done an excellent job for Bill Belichick | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Matt Patricia has been the Patriots' defensive coordinator since 2012. When you look at his body of work, it's clearly <a href="http://www.patriots.com/news/2016/02/25/combine-patriots-dc-matt-patricia-will-be-head-coach-shortly" target="_blank">only a matter of time</a> before the 42-year-old lands a head-coaching job in the National Football League. The one problem with the job in Jacksonville? The Jaguars may be reluctant to hire another coach with a defensive background.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Kevin Sumlin, head coach, Texas A&amp;M</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568527" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568527" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kevin-Sumlin_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images-1024x652.jpg" alt="5 Potential Head Coaches to Replace Gus Bradley of the Jacksonville Jaguars | Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="482" /> Several NFL teams have considered Kevin Sumlin for head coaching vacancies in past years | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

Every offseason, Kevin Sumlin's name <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-college-football-coaches-2016.html/">rises from the college ranks</a> for NFL head-coaching jobs. He is excellent when it comes to relating to players. And the 52-year-old is one of the most innovative offensive football coaches (at any level).

If Jacksonville can lure Sumlin away from Texas A&amp;M, it may be a near perfect fit. At the very least, the 52-year-old coach would bring an offensive system ideal for quarterback Blake Bortles and the rest of the Jaguars' explosive offensive personnel. This would surely inject excitement into one of the most deprived fanbases in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Frank Reich, offensive coordinator, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhASCL-3GwU"></iframe>

NFL fans still know <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/greatest-backup-nfl-quarterbacks.html/">Frank Reich</a> best for leading the Buffalo Bills to an amazing comeback win (see above video) during the wild-card round of the 1992 AFC Playoffs. Since his retirement, the former NFL quarterback has developed into one of the premier offensive coaches in the league.

He is currently in his first season as the Eagles' offensive coordinator. Given the job he is doing with rookie quarterback Carson Wentz, Reich will be a hot name for every available head-coaching job next offseason. This is a guy the Jacksonville Jaguars may target to help get Bortles over the hump.

		<description><![CDATA[Consistently winning games in the NFL is no easy task. Here's a look at the five active NFL head coaches with the most career wins.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_684734" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684734" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Don-Shula_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x647.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="478" /> Don Shula has more wins than any other coach in NFL history | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Achieving long-term success and consistently winning games in the National Football League is no easy task. Especially for NFL coaches. They may have reached the pinnacle of the football coaching industry, but as a direct result, they regularly turn in 80-plus hour workweeks, they rarely see their families, and oftentimes they are forced to sleep in their offices. And all of this comes with no guarantee of winning, and virtually zero semblance of any kind of job security.

When it comes to winning games in the NFL, Don Shula (pictured above) is the king. The legendary former Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Colts head coach is the leader in all-time career wins by a NFL head coach, with 328. And it is highly unlikely that his record will ever be broken. The next closest active coach is more than 100 wins behind him, and as we all know, in today's NFL coaches don't usually last for 33 seasons the way Shula did. New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick has a chance, albeit a small one given that he is already 64-years-old, to make a run at challenging Shula's record, but ultimately, we just don't see it happening.

Knowing that there isn't a current coach in the league with a realistic chance at eclipsing Shula's win total, we thought it would be a good idea to dig deeper and take a look at who are the winningest coaches in the NFL today. Here’s what we found.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5.  Marvin Lewis, Cincinnati Bengals – 112 career wins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_576967" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-576967" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Marvin-Lewis_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images-1024x700.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="517" /> Marvin Lewis has won a lot of regular season games with the Cincinnati Bengals | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Lewis has spent his entire 13-year head-coaching career with the Bengals. In that time, he has taken the team from being one of the biggest laughingstocks in the league, to being one of the premier teams in the AFC. In the last four years, Lewis has led the Bengals to 43 wins, but the 57-year-old head coach still finds himself squarely implanted on the hot seat due to the fact that he has yet to lead the team to a win in the postseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. John Fox, Chicago Bears - 125 career wins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684738" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684738" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/John-Fox_Michael-B.-Thomas_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> John Fox has quietly won a lot of games during his career as an NFL head coach | Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images[/caption]

You may be a bit surprised to see Fox on this list, but with 14 years of experience as an NFL head coach, it makes sense that he would be among the winningest active coaches in the league. Fox totaled 73 total wins and one NFC Championship during his nine seasons with the Carolina Panthers, he totaled 46 wins and one AFC Championship in a four-year run with the Denver Broncos, and he won six games during his first season with the Chicago Bears. Unfortunately for Fox, his career as an NFL head coach could be in jeopardy if he doesn't show signs of turning things around in Chicago in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3.  Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs – 161 career wins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676873" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676873" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Andy-Reid_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1-1024x712.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Andy Reid has had a Hall of Fame caliber career as an NFL head coach | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Reid is entering his fourth season as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. During that stretch of time, Reid has been the cog behind a major turnaround for the once-proud franchise, as he inherited a team that was the worst team in the league the year before he took over. The Chiefs are now among the better teams in the AFC, and should again contend for a postseason spot in 2016.

The majority of Reid’s wins (130) as a head coach came during his 14-year run as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles made the playoffs nine times under Reid, reaching the Super Bowl in 2004.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2.  Jeff Fisher, Los Angeles Rams – 169 career wins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_680647" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-680647" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jeff-Fisher-Dilip-Vishwanat-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Rams head coach Jeff Fisher looks concerned... for his job | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Rams head coach Jeff Fisher looks concerned... for his job | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

Fisher is in his fifth season as the head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, where he has yet to achieve the type of success he did in his 17-year run as the head coach of the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans. Fisher has yet to lead the Rams to a winning season, and has won 27 total games in St. Louis/Los Angeles, after winning 142 in Houston/Tennessee. He led the Titans to the playoffs six times and guided them to the Super Bowl in 1999.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1.  Bill Belichick, New England Patriots – 223 career wins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676876" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-676876" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bill-Belichick_Elsa_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="800" height="534" /> Bill Belichick is the greatest coach in NFL history | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Belichick is currently in his 22nd season as a head coach in the NFL. While he has a strong case for being the greatest coach in NFL history, there was a time when he appeared to be nothing more than average. Belichick's first NFL head coaching job was with the Cleveland Browns, where he compiled just 36 wins and one playoff appearance in five seasons. And then he was traded (yes, traded) to the New England Patriots, and the rest is history.

The 2016 season will be Belichick’s 17th as the head coach of the Patriots, and all he has done during his time in New England is build a dynasty that has won 187 games, 13 AFC East division titles, six AFC championships, and four Super Bowls. Needless to say, his place in the Pro Football Hall of Fame is already waiting for him.

The saying, “one man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” has a lot of validity in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>. We regularly see situations where one franchise <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/big-name-nfl-offseason-cuts-2017.html/" target="_blank">will cut ties with a player</a> who will ultimately go on to reach superstar status with one of the other franchises around the league. However several NFL players are flat-out, undeniably, overrated.

When it comes down to it, players typically fall into the overrated category due to unwarranted hype or undeserved contracts. <span class="s1">P</span>layers often enter the NFL after having legendary careers at the college level. And as we all know, success in college doesn't necessarily equate to success at the professional level. When it comes to contracts, teams often pay players based on potential and regularly get burned <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-nfl-contracts-today.html/" target="_blank">when their investments don't pan out</a>.

There will always be a fair amount of subjectivity involved when evaluating players in the NFL. To make this list as objective as possible, we considered the player grades from <a href="https://www.profootballfocus.com/ratings/#/ratings/home" target="_blank">Pro Football Focus</a>, more general on-field statistics, and the monetary value of each player’s contract when making our decisions. Now, without further delay, here is a look at the five most overrated players in the NFL based on their performances during the 2015 season.

<h2>1. Joe Flacco, QB, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Joe-Flacco_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="BALTIMORE, MD - NOVEMBER 24: Quarterback Joe Flacco #5 of the Baltimore Ravens looks on after throwing an interception against the New York Jets in the second quarter at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on November 24, 2013 in Baltimore, Maryland. " width="757" height="504" /> Outside of one incredible run during the 2012 Playoffs, Joe Flacco has been very average as an NFL quarterback | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  71.3</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  26</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $22.55 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $22.13 million</li>
</ul>
Yes, Joe Flacco does have a Super Bowl ring. So do guys like Trent Dilfer, Brad Johnson, and Doug Williams. In actuality, outside of his run of fantastic play throughout the 2012<span class="s1">–</span>13 postseason (resulting in him <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-nfl-players-2016.html/">landing a massive contract extension</a>, by the way), Flacco has been incredibly average throughout his eight-year NFL career.

He still doesn’t a season of 30 or more touchdown passes on his resume, and it’s becoming more and more clear that the success Flacco enjoyed early in his career was a direct result of having an excellent supporting cast. He is now the fourth-highest-paid signal caller in the league in terms of average annual salary. In our eyes, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/quarterbacks-who-undeservedly-make-more-money-than-tom-brady.html/">paying a guy</a> who has graded out as the 26th-best quarterback in the league that kind of money will continue to prevent the Ravens from truly rebuilding and becoming a Super Bowl-caliber team anytime soon.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Demaryius Thomas, WR, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_643148" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-643148" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Demaryius-Thomas_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Dustin Bradford/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas took a major step backwards in 2015 | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  80.1</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  23</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $15.2 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $14.0 million</li>
</ul>
There is no arguing that Demaryius Thomas is one of the most physically talented wide receivers in the National Football League. His combination of size, speed, agility, and game-breaking ability is extremely rare. With that being said, Thomas still found his way on our list thanks to his wildly inconsistent play.

If you look solely at his statistics over the last two years (188 catches for 2,320 yards and 11 touchdowns), it looks like Thomas has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-nfl-wide-receivers-2016.html/">lived up to the contract</a> he signed in July 2015. In reality those numbers could be (and should be) much better. He is one of the league-leaders in dropped passes over the last two seasons, while struggling to come down with 50-50 passes and make clutch plays in critical situations.

While the Broncos rewarded Thomas with a contract that paid him like one of the league’s top-five wide receivers last offseason, the former Georgia Tech standout paid his team back by turning in a performance that led PFF to rank him as the 49th-best wideout in the league in 2015 and the 23rd best in 2016.

<h2>3. Julius Thomas, TE, Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>
[caption id="attachment_643149" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-643149" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Julius-Thomas_Sam-Greenwood_Getty-Images-640x421.jpg" alt="Sam Greenwood/Getty Images" width="757" height="498" /> Julius Thomas of the Jacksonville Jaguars may be the worst blocking tight end in the NFL | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  66.6</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  30</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $7.3 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $9.2 million</li>
</ul>
Julius Thomas is an immensely gifted athlete, but up to this point in his NFL career, the former college basketball player has been a disappointment. During his time with the Denver Broncos, Julius proved that he can be a game-changer in the passing game, and the Jaguars paid him big money to pack his bags and take his talents to Jacksonville.

And as was the case when he was in Denver, Julius proved to be a major liability as a blocker and continued to miss extensive action due to health issues throughout his first two seasons in Jacksonville. He is now the fourth-highest-paid tight end in the league, yet PFF graded him out as the 30th-best player in the game at his position.

<h2>4. Brandon Carr, CB, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_541618" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-541618 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Brandon-Carr_Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="581" /> Brandon Carr is still underperforming | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  69.4</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  78</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $10.217 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $10.02 million</li>
</ul>
Brandon Carr has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-contracts-that-badly-need-to-be-restructured.html/">restructured his contract twice</a> (once in 2013 and again last offseason), yet he remains one of the most overpaid players in the game. The 30-year-old cornerback has been a solid contributor at times for the Cowboys, but there is no denying that he simply hasn't lived up to the five-year, $50.1 million deal he signed with the team in 2012 (he is the 11th-highest paid corner in the game and has graded out as the league's 78th best player at the position in 2016).

The Cowboys have essentially been married to Carr because of his contract, but will be able to move on in 2017 if they so desire for a minimal dead money salary cap hit of $2.717 million.

<h2>5. Jonathan Stewart, RB, Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_561402" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-561402 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jonathan-Stewart_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Jonathan Stewart hasn't lived up to his contract | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  78.2</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  9</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $9.55 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $7.3 million</li>
</ul>
Jonathan Stewart has been a solid performer for the Panthers throughout his nine-year career with the franchise. But with only one 1,000-yard season on his resume, it's hard to justify his standing as the fourth-highest-paid running back in the league. Furthermore, Stewart is rapidly approaching his 30th birthday and has struggled to stay healthy in recent seasons.

When the dust settles on his career, Stewart simply won't be remembered as one of the all-time greats, even though he was paid like one.

<h2>6. Darrelle Revis, CB, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_579357" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-579357" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Darrelle-Revis_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-1024x628.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="464" /> Darrelle Revis has lost a step | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  70.8</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  76</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $17 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $14,024,212</li>
</ul>
Regardless of how the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-changing-teams-2017.html/">rest of his career plays out</a>, Darrelle Revis is a lock to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame -- possibly in his first year of eligibility. That said, the four-time All-Pro simply isn't the player he was earlier in his career. He has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-paycut-2017.html/">undoubtedly lost a step</a>, and is no longer capable of consistently shutting down an elite wide receiver for an entire game.

Revis is the second-highest-paid cornerback in the game (behind Josh Norman), and ranks as the 76th-best corner in the NFL according to PFF.

<h2>7. Brock Osweiler, QB, Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_719170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-719170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Brock-Osweiler_Adam-Glanzman_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Adam Glanzman/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Brock Osweiler has been a bust for the Houston Texans | Adam Glanzman/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  40.9</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  35</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $12 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $18 million</li>
</ul>
Where should we start with this one? Not only is Brock Osweiler overrated (by any possible metric), he also may be the worst free-agent signing in NFL history. The Texans have already benched the 26-year-old quarterback less than one full season into the four-year, $72 million deal they gave him last offseason, and to us, that speaks volumes about how bad Osweiler has been in 2016.

This one can be chalked up to the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-facing-salary-cap-issues-2017.html/">Texans front office</a> (their head coach, Bill O'Brien, gets a pass here) buying into the unwarranted hype of a player who benefitted from playing alongside one of the greatest defenses in NFL history with the Denver Broncos in 2015.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Muhammad Wilkerson, DE, New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_664644" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-664644" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Muhammad-Wilkerson_Ron-Antonelli_Getty-Images-1024x652.jpg" alt="Ron Antonelli/Getty Images" width="757" height="482" /> Muhammad Wilkerson's play has been disappointing in 2016 | Ron Antonelli/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  40.9</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  117</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $10 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $17.2 million</li>
</ul>
When Muhammad Wilkerson is focused and playing with something to prove, he is hands down one of the best defensive linemen in the entire league. Unfortunately, it looks as though the former Temple Owl has lost some of his drive and determination since landing a five-year, $86 million deal from the Jets last offseason.

Wilkerson has recorded only 2.5 sacks and 48 total tackles in 2016, and has been far from the disruptive force that he was in seasons past. The Jets made him the highest-paid defensive end in the league, and Wilkerson has paid them back with an effort resulting in him being graded out as the 117th-best player at his position in the NFL.

<h2>9. Randall Cobb, WR, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_559660" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-559660 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Randall-Cobb_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="757" height="580" /> Randall Cobb is nothing more than a complimentary piece | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  77.5</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  32</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $9.15 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $10 million</li>
</ul>
After his performance in 2015, this much is clear: Randall Cobb is not a No. 1 NFL wide receiver. With Jordy Nelson out for the year with a torn ACL, we expected a wildly productive season out of Cobb in 2015.  Instead, he responded to his increased role by posting 79 catches for 829 yards and six touchdowns. Those aren't terrible numbers, but they also aren't acceptable considering what the Packers are paying him.

In 2016, Cobb is on a similar pace. Through 13 games, he has caught 60 passes for 610 yards and four touchdowns. Again, those types of numbers make him vastly overpaid. With an average annual salary of $10 million, Cobb is making more money than guys like Antonio Brown, Golden Tate, and Brandon Marshall.

<h2>10. Mario Williams, DE, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_735958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-735958" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mario-Williams_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images-1024x680.jpg" alt="Mario Williams won't be with the Miami Dolphins for much longer | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Mario Williams won't be with the Miami Dolphins for much longer | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  73.2</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  58</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $6.5 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $8.5 million</li>
</ul>
Just a few years ago, Mario Williams was arguably the best defensive player in the National Football League. However, he just hasn't been the same since the 2014 season. Part of it could be his age (he'll turn 32 in January); part of it could be due to a change in scheme during his final season with the Buffalo Bills. Either way, there is no denying that Williams is severely overrated at this point in his career -- something the Dolphins have learned firsthand throughout the 2016 season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>11. Jairus Byrd, S, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708816" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708816" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jairus-Byrd_Sean-Gardner_Getty-Images-1024x688.jpg" alt="Jairus Byrd hasn't given the New Orleans Saints a very good return on their investment | Sean Gardner/Getty Images" width="757" height="509" /> Jairus Byrd hasn't given the New Orleans Saints a very good return on their investment | Sean Gardner/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>PFF Grade:</u>  77.1</li>
 	<li><u>PFF Position Rank:</u>  48</li>
 	<li><u>2016 Salary Cap Hit:</u>  $10.9 million</li>
 	<li><u>Average Annual Salary:</u>  $9 million</li>
</ul>
The Saints signed Jairus Byrd to a massive contract (six years, $54 million) back in 2014, and needless to say, they have gotten little return on their investment up to this point. To be fair, Byrd can't really do anything about the injuries he's suffered since signing with New Orleans, but even when he has been on the field, the former Oregon safety has had a very minimal impact on the Saints' defense.

Byrd is currently the sixth-highest-paid safety in the league, while grading out at the 48th-best safety in the NFL.

		<description><![CDATA[Usually you think of Peyton Manning, not Eli, when you think of touchdown passes, but the Giants' signal-caller is catching up to his older brother.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_585016" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-585016" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eli-Manning_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="517" /> Through Week 5, Eli Manning has managed to throw 298 career touchdown passes. Only seven NFL players have ever broken 300 | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

It's easy to forget now, but 2014 was a historic season in the annals of the National Football League, as future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning threw the 500th touchdown pass <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/15-best-statistical-performances-of-peyton-mannings-career.html/" target="_blank">of his legendary career</a>.  Currently, another Manning stands on the cusp of a similar career milestone, as Eli Manning has managed to find himself with 298 career touchdowns to his name, just two away from something that only seven other NFL quarterbacks have managed to do before. Who are they (aside from Peyton, of course)? Lets take a look back at the top of the record books and see what kind of famous and familiar names we find.

<h2>7. John Elway - 300</h2>
[caption id="attachment_698261" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-698261 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Denver-Broncos-Mark-Leffingwell-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Mark Leffingwell/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="490" /> John Elway is a hell of a GM, and was a hell of a player, too | Mark Leffingwell/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Our list begins with another one-time face of the Denver Bronco, former quarterback, and current general manager John Elway. Elway, the man who brought Peyton Manning to the Mile High City, threw for 300 touchdowns in his 16-year Hall of Fame career, all of them with the same franchise. He was known for bringing the Broncos late, <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=64" target="_blank">leading his team</a> to 47 fourth quarter comeback wins, and finished his playing days with a pair of Super Bowl rings.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Fran Tarkenton - 342</h2>
[caption id="attachment_707431" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-707431 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/138159685.jpg" alt="Cindy Ord/Getty Images" width="757" height="648" /> In many respects, Fran Tarkenton was the original superstar quarterback | Cindy Ord/Getty Images[/caption]

Fran Tarkenton threw for double-digit touchdowns in 17 of the 18 years he played professional football, including a career-high 29 in 1967. Tarkenton finished with 342 scoring passes in all while playing for the Vikings, the Giants, and then the Vikings again. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1986.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Dan Marino - 420</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684395" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-684395 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Dan-Marino-Rhona-Wise-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="638" /> "Laces out, Dan!" | Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Dan Marino threw 420 scoring passes during his 17-year career, all of them for the Miami Dolphins. Marino was a star from the get-go, leading the league in passing touchdowns in his second, third, and fourth campaigns (48, 30, and 44 touchdowns, respectively). He never threw more than 30 in a year again. Marino <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=238&amp;tab=Capsule" target="_blank">was inducted</a> to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.

<h2>4. Tom Brady - 428</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702319" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-702319 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/455880058-640x445.jpg" alt="Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="756" height="526" /> Now that he's returned from his suspension, we can finally stop talking about Deflategate  | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

One of just two active quarterbacks among the top five all time touchdown leaders, Patriots signal-caller Tom Brady has thrown for 428 touchdown passes (and counting, now that he's officially back from his suspension). The four-time champion has won 77% of his regular-season starts, has started all 16 games in 11 of the Pats’ last 12 full seasons, and has guided New England to a winning season in each of those years. He threw 50 scoring strikes in the 2007 campaign, when the Patriots didn’t lose a regular sesason game.

<h2>3. Drew Brees - 438</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674903" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674903 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Drew-Brees-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> If only the Saints were doing as well as Drew Brees' arm | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees has thrown 438 touchdown passes during his 17-year career, first with the Chargers and now with the Saints. Brees seems to be getting better with age, racking up three straight years with at least 39 touchdowns after never having topped 34 in a season before that. Brees, who led the Saints to a victory in Super Bowl XLIV, will likely end his illustrious career even higher on this list.

<h2>2. Brett Favre - 508<strong>
</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_703668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703668 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/72804719-640x426.jpg" alt="Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> One-time holder of the#1 spot on this list, Brett Favre | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

The ex-Packers/Jets/Vikings gunslinger now only sits atop the league record books for <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/the-8-most-intercepted-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">most interceptions ever</a>, but, until very recently, had also thrown the most touchdowns of any NFL player ever, with 508. Sadly for Favre, he’ll be keeping one record quite a bit longer than the other,. Favre threw 112 scores in a three-year span from 1995-1997, with those seasons representing the best touchdown totals of his career. The Super Bowl XXXI champion was finally inducted into the Hall of Fame this year,  but he would have been in a lot sooner if not for <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/the-brett-favre-club-10-athletes-who-couldnt-stay-retired.html/" target="_blank">his penchant for un-retiring</a> (which merely delayed the inevitable).

<h2>1. Peyton Manning -  539</h2>

Like we mentioned earlier, The aforementioned Peyton Manning entered 2014 at No. 2 on this list with 503 touchdown passes, a number he easily obliterated that season. Manning threw nearly 400 touchdowns with the Colts from 1998-2010, and managed to throw for another 140  with his second new franchise. Manning was named the MVP of Super Bowl XLI with Indianapolis, and racked up scores of accolades during his four seasons in the Mile High City. He also became the first starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl for two different clubs with a Broncos victory over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl  50, 17 seasons after he made his NFL debut.

		<description><![CDATA[In the NFL, quarterback play can be the difference in winning and losing. Knowing that, here's our rankings of the 8 worst starting QBs in the league. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have said this a time or two before, but <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-that-should-trade-their-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">quarterback is the most important position in American professional sports</a>. And in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, quarterback play is often the difference between winning and losing, and can also be the deciding factor as to whether or not a team is postseason worthy. Knowing this, it should come as no surprise that teams are regularly willing to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-breaking-down-the-fallout-from-the-rams-titans-trade.html/" target="_blank">mortgage their draft and salary cap future</a> in hopes of landing an elite, franchise-changing quarterback.

It is rare, but every so often, there will be an NFL team that finds immense success and wins a Super Bowl without a dominant quarterback. Most recently, the Denver Broncos did it in 2015, and before them the Tampa Bay Buccaneers accomplished the feat in 2002, and the Baltimore Ravens pulled it off in 2000. Only time will tell if there will ever be another team that joins that list.

As we head into training camp, there are still several quarterback situations around the league that are less than ideal. Here is our ranking (in descending order) of the seven worst quarterbacks in the league right now.
<h2>8. Marcus Mariota, Tennessee Titans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621875" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621875" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Marcus-Mariota_Stacy-Revere_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Stacy Revere/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Marcus Mariota was thrown into a tough situation with the Tennessee Titans | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

Don’t let Mariota’s inclusion on this list fool you: we still firmly believe that the former Oregon quarterback has a bright future ahead of him in the National Football League. The Titans were easily one of the worst teams in the league last year – especially on offense, which made Mariota’s job substantially more difficult. Their offensive line was atrocious, their rushing attack was average at best, and they had a below average group of wide receivers.

As the Titans continue to add pieces to Mariota’s supporting cast, we are confident that the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner will continue to improve as an NFL signal caller. And as that happens, he will eventually become a bona fide franchise quarterback.

<h2>7. Jay Cutler, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_670499" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-670499" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jay-Cutler_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1024x725.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="536" /> Jay Cutler's immense talent has never truly materialized in the NFL | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to having raw physical ability, Cutler is a top-five quarterback in the NFL. When it comes to being a complete quarterback, though, the 33-year-old Indiana native hasn't been able to put it all together. And based on what we've seen over the course of his 10-year NFL career, he probably never will.

While there is a good chance that he will eventually join the 300 touchdown pass club, Cutler has still made just one postseason appearance during his professional career, and simply isn't the type of player you can build a franchise around.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Sam Bradford, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_708824" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-708824" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sam-Bradford-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MINNEAPOLIS, MN - SEPTEMBER 18: Quarterback Sam Bradford #8 of the Minnesota Vikings celebrates after completing a touchdown pass in the third quarter of the game against the Green Bay Packers on September 18, 2016 at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings defeated the Packers 17-14. (Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images)" width="757" height="503" /> Sam Bradford celebrates after completing a touchdown pass | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

The way the Eagles handled their quarterback situation this offseason was perplexing. They started off by signing Bradford, who, on top of having a less than stellar injury history, struggled in his only season in Philadelphia, to a two-year, $35 million contract extension that included $22 million in guaranteed money. They followed that up by signing Chase Daniel to a three-year, $21 million contract with $12 million in guaranteed money during free agency. Then they completely shook things up (and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15280364/cleveland-browns-trade-no-2-pick-draft-philadelphia-eagles-five-picks" target="_blank">gave away five drafts picks</a>) by trading up in the 2016 NFL Draft for former North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz and eventually sent Bradford to Minnesota. Regardless of location, Bradford offers very little upside (if he can even stay healthy), and is nothing more than a placeholder for the position until Teddy Bridgewater is ready to go.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Brock Osweiler, Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682705" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-682705" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Brock-Osweiler_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1-1024x691.jpg" alt="Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Brock Osweiler didn't show us anything in 2015 that leads us to believe he will be successful with the Houston Texans | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Texans shelled out big money for Osweiler this offseason in a move that clearly signified how desperate they were to improve at the quarterback position. And unfortunately for the NFL's newest franchise, they paid $72 million for a signal caller that has shown nothing that would lead us to believe he is a Pro Bowl caliber player.

In four years, Osweiler made seven starts for the Denver Broncos while Peyton Manning nursed a couple of injuries. In that time, the former Arizona State standout posted a 5-2 record and had a couple of nice moments. However, without Denver's historically great defense to fall back on, Osweiler's flaws would have been completely exposed. Don't be shocked if the Texans are kicking themselves for making this move when the 2016 season comes to an end.

<h2>4. Robert Griffin III, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590362" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590362" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Robert Griffin III is getting a second chance in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-the-addition-of-robert-griffin-iii-means-for-the-browns.html/" target="_blank">Browns are giving Griffin a chance to resurrect his once-promising career</a> after the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner was released by the Washington Redskins early in the offseason. He has proven that he can be an effective NFL quarterback, but aside from his rookie season, it quickly became clear that Griffin was not totally comfortable with the speed of the game in the NFL or playing in a pro-style offense. And on top of that, he had major issues staying healthy.

Griffin will have the added benefit of getting to work with a quarterback guru in new Browns head coach Hugh Jackson. However, we remain confident that Griffin peaked during his rookie season with the Redskins. Don’t be surprised if the Browns are in the market for a new starting quarterback within the next two years.

<h2>3. Trevor Siemian, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_686351" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-686351" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trevor-Siemian_Dustin-Bradford_Getty-Images-2-1024x836.jpg" alt="Dustin Bradford/Getty Images" width="757" height="618" /> Trevor Siemian has yet to attempt a regular season pass in the NFL | Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

It appears as though the Broncos have decided to ride out the 2016 season with <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/trevor-siemian-denver-broncos-starter.html/" target="_blank">Siemian as their starting quarterback</a>. And to be frank, nobody really knows what to expect from the former Northwestern standout. He has flashed an excellent physical skillset and the ability to make all the necessary throws, but until he faces a season's worth of live action, it's hard to know exactly what the Broncos have in Siemian.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Case Keenum, Los Angeles Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_672753" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-672753" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Case-Keenum_Steve-Dykes_Getty-Images-1024x632.jpg" alt="Steve Dykes/Getty Images" width="757" height="467" /> Case Keenum likely won't last very much longer as the Los Angeles Rams' starting quarterback | Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, there is a reason why the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15201946/tennessee-titans-trade-no-1-pick-los-angeles-rams" target="_blank">Rams chose to mortgage their future</a> by trading away two first-round picks, two second-round picks, and two third-round picks to move up to the No. 1 slot in the 2016 NFL Draft to select former Cal quarterback Jared Goff.

As of now, Keenum is slated to open the season as the team’s starter ahead of Goff, who, based on his performance in preseason action thus far, is going to need a lot more time to develop. But in reality, it’s only a matter of time before the Rams will want to hand over the reigns to Goff and start building towards the future, even if Keenum is playing above-average football in 2016.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Blaine Gabbert, San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_688143" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-688143" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blaine-Gabbert_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Blaine Gabbert is currently the worst starting quarterback in the NFL | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

With Colin Kaepernick missing the majority of training camp, Gabbert appears to have won the 49ers' starting quarterback job by default. And based on what we have seen out of the former Missouri signal caller during preseason, the 2016 season could be disastrous for San Francisco. The Niners will likely go back to Kaepernick in Week 5, but until then, they will have the unenviable distinction of having the worst starting quarterback in the NFL this season.

		<description><![CDATA[Week 2 is in the books, which means it's time to lock in those Week 3 fantasy football lineups. Let's break down the fantasy running backs.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[There may be no tougher fantasy decision to make on a weekly basis than who to utilize at running back. With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-power-rankings-week-3.html/" target="_blank">Week 3 on the horizon</a>, it's time to talk about which fantasy running backs deserve to be in your lineup and who should ride the pine. Let's jump into it by looking at a player who's set to see a massive boost in his workload this weekend.
<h2>Start 'em: Theo Riddick, Detroit Lions</h2>
[caption id="attachment_701501" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-701501" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TheoRiddick-640x431.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="757" height="509" /> Theo Riddick of the Detroit Lions celebrates against the Indianapolis Colts | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

With Ameer Abdullah placed on the injured reserve, it will be Theo Riddick's show starting in Week 3. He's now the man for the Lions in both the running game and passing game out of the backfield, and he should be in for a huge day. Through two weeks, Riddick has been a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-exceeded-expectations-week-1.html/">strong fantasy football option</a>, specifically thanks to his ability to catch passes. The 25-year-old out of Notre Dame has nine catches for 91 yards and a touchdown through Week 2, while also rushing for 82 yards and a score in limited action on the ground. Expect his numbers to go up in each category this weekend.
<h2>Bench 'em: Jeremy Langford, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639307" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639307" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jeremy-Langford_Mike-McGinnis_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="757" height="505" /> Jeremy Langford isn't sure why he's smiling | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

Basically, the <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com/news/chalk-talk/article-1/Does-Howard-deserve-a-promotion/722d147d-444e-44e8-bbad-c03d4756585b" target="_blank">team's official website</a> posed the question of whether or not backup <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underdog-picks-offensive-rookie-year.html/">running back Jordan Howard</a> deserves a promotion. It's safe to say the topic didn't come up because of Howard's performances so far this season. Through two games, he's only received three carries for 22 yards. It's likely due to Jeremy Langford's recent terrible performances. He averaged just three yards-per-carry over the last two games. His most recent performance against the Philadelphia Eagles involved 11 carries for 28 yards. A touchdown saved his day twice now, but don't bet on it happening in Week 3.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Start 'em: Charles Sims, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CharlesSims.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="1024" height="759" /> Charles Sims of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

No, Charles Sims' matchup with the Los Angeles Rams isn't great, but his workload is more than ideal. With Doug Martin expected to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-injuries-week-2-nfl.html/">miss multiple games</a>, Sims has the chance to step in and receive as many carries and receptions as he can handle. This type of work is something you can't ignore in fantasy football. Plus, Sims <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-nfl-players-who-dont-belong-on-the-bench.html/">is a major playmaker</a>, so his big-play ability could easily set him up for a huge day. Remember: One run alone could justify you starting him in your fantasy football league. Don't shy away from Sims this week, and also don't forget what <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-fantasy-football-running-backs.html/">Carlos Hyde</a> did to the Rams two weeks ago.
<h2>Bench 'em: Thomas Rawls, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_655960" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-655960" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Thomas-Rawls_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-3-640x427.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="757" height="505" /> Expect to see Thomas Rawls struggle during Week 3 | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

It's been the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-running-backs-love.html/">Christine Michael show</a> through two games. In Week 2 he was the only running back able to do anything for the Seahawks. To contrast his performance, Rawls totaled seven carries for negative seven (yes, negative) yards against the Rams. He struggled in a big way, and Seattle draws a San Francisco 49ers defense that shockingly bottled up Todd Gurley in Week 1. Rawls may have a mediocre day, but Michael will still get plenty of work, and that, paired with Rawls' struggles, make him a player to keep on your bench until he gives you a reason to think it's going to change.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Start 'em: Spencer Ware, Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_697502" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-697502" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Alex-Smith-Kansas-City-Chiefs-Spencer-Ware-640x426.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="757" height="504" /> Alex Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs hands the ball off to Spencer Ware | Jason O. Watson/Getty Images[/caption]

There's no reason to jump off the Spencer Ware bandwagon anytime soon. While he didn't score a touchdown last week and didn't catch seven passes like he did the week before, he still averaged 5.7 yards-per-carry. The unfortunate truth is that when the Chiefs play from behind the entire game it makes it tough to run the ball much. This is a big reason why Ware only has 21 carries through two games. While the New York Jets defense isn't bad, don't be surprised to see Ware finally top 15 carries and also catch four or five passes as well on Sunday.
<h2>Bench 'em: Ryan Mathews, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_580484" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580484" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ryan-Mathews-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images-640x488.jpg" alt="Week 3 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Fantasy Running Backs" width="757" height="577" /> Ryan Mathews of the Philadelphia Eagles is tackled after making a catch by Ndamukong Suh of the Miami Dolphins | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

After two games, it may be time to pump the brakes just a bit on Mathews. While he's received 31 carries through two games, the 28-year-old saw his total touches drop from 22 down to 10 in the span of one week. Also, his ability to score touchdowns saved both of his fantasy football days. Betting on a guy to score touchdowns as a starting fantasy running back isn't always the best idea, and Mathews looks like his arrow is pointed down heading into Week 3. Through two games, he's averaged just 3.5 yards-per-carry and has only 109 rushing yards. Hard pass this week.

		<description><![CDATA[Now that we've had some time to digest what happened in Week 2, here are our NFL power rankings heading into Week 3 of the 2016 season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/">National Football League</a> season is in full swing, and we have a pretty good feel for which teams have the best chance to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-li.html" target="_blank">compete for the Super Bowl LI title</a> next February. This past week, we saw a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-predictions-favorite-teams-lose.html/" target="_blank">handful of upsets</a>, several great individual performances, a multitude of serious injuries, and many attention-grabbing games. Now that we’ve had a chance to digest what we watched over the last two weeks, we can give our <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/nfl-power-rankings/">NFL power rankings</a> heading into Week 3 of the 2016 season.
<h2>32. Cleveland Browns (0-2)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_700091" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-700091" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hue-Jackson-Cody-Kessler-Cleveland-Browns.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="505" /> Head coach Hue Jackson talks with quarterback Cody Kessler of the Cleveland Browns during a preseason game in 2016 | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

After jumping to a 20-0 first quarter lead, it looked as though the Browns would pull off a shocking upset win over the Baltimore Ravens. As it turned out, Cleveland couldn't score another point and lost to the Ravens by a score of 25-20. During the loss, the Browns also lost their second starting quarterback this season when Josh McCown suffered an injury to his non-throwing shoulder that will sideline him for at least one week. The Browns now turn to rookie Cody Kessler, who was a third-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, to run their offense while McCown is on the mend. Expect the losses to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-nfl-teams-that-just-cant-stop-sucking.html/">continue piling up</a> for Cleveland.
<h2>31. Chicago Bears (0-2)</h2>
The Chicago Bears took a pretty severe beating at the hands of the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night. Now they could <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000706380/article/john-fox-jay-cutler-suffered-right-thumb-sprain" target="_blank">lack quarterback Jay Cutler</a> for an extended period of time (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/bears-will-never-win-super-bowl-with-jay-cutler.html/">not that this is a bad thing</a>) after the 33-year-old quarterback sprained his right thumb, which involves his throwing hand, during the team’s 29-14 loss. This team is headed toward a high pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.
<h2>30. Buffalo Bills (0-2)</h2>
The Buffalo Bills are in a bit of a free-fall. It’s clear that this franchise is currently in a state of dysfunction. Barring an unforeseen turnaround, we expect a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/11-teams-cheapest-tickets-nfl.html/">complete overhaul</a> of their front office, coaching staff, and roster next offseason.
<h2>29. Los Angeles Rams (1-1)</h2>
The Rams played an excellent game on the defensive side of the ball, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-seattle-seahawks-need-worry.html/">holding the Seattle Seahawks</a> to just three points in their first regular-season home game in Los Angeles. That said, we can’t get over <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-trouble-offense-season.html/">how bad their offense is</a>. Expect this team to stay competitive when their defense plays well. But when they don’t, the Rams will likely look like the team we saw during their Week 1 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.

<h2>28. San Francisco 49ers (1-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_700090" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-700090" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Blaine-Gabbert-San-Francisco-49ers.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="507" /> Blaine Gabbert of the San Francisco 49ers drops back to pass against the Carolina Panthers | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

The 49ers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-week-2-games-no-one-cares.html/">got pounded</a> by the Carolina Panthers in Week 2 by a score of 46-27. We do like some of the pieces they have in place, and it was encouraging to see them put up 27 points on a staunch Carolina defense, but this team is destined to land a top-10 pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.
<h2>27. Miami Dolphins (0-2)</h2>
For reasons that we cannot comprehend, the Dolphins continue to underachieve. We are becoming more and more convinced that quarterback Ryan Tannehill is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/">not the long-term solution</a> in Miami. However, this team still has one of the better defensive lines in the league, as well as a really good group of wide receivers. Our guess is that 2016 will be another mediocre season for the Dolphins.
<h2>26. Tennessee Titans (1-1)</h2>
The Titans shocked the Detroit Lions in Week 2 by a score of 16-15 in large part due to their second consecutive standout defensive performance. They were also much better on the offensive side of the ball, but this team is still <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ugliest-nfl-uniforms.html/">hard to view</a> as a serious playoff contender.
<h2>25. Indianapolis Colts (0-2)</h2>
If you ask us, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-favorite-teams.html/">Indianapolis Colts</a> are in danger of wasting a once-in-a-generation player in quarterback Andrew Luck. General Manager Ryan Grigson built a defense and placed a supporting case around Luck that just aren’t good enough to consistently win in the National Football League.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>24. Jacksonville Jaguars (0-2)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_666117" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-666117" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blake-Bortles_Charlie-Crowhurst_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="521" /> Quarterback Blake Bortles of the Jacksonville Jaguars looks to pass | Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images[/caption]

Bottom line: The Jaguars are running out of excuses. They invested too much money, used too many high draft picks, and boast too much talent to get humiliated by a middle-of-the-road team like the San Diego Chargers, which we witnessed in Week 2. At this rate, Gus Bradley is on the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-head-coach-likely-fired-first.html/">fast track to being fired</a> before the 2016 season comes to an end.
<h2>23. Washington Redskins (0-2)</h2>
Just when we thought things were turning around in Washington, the Redskins appear to be completely falling apart after only two weeks. Reports surfaced about the team having a <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/kirk-cousins-is-finding-out-it-still-stinks-in-redskins-locker-room-051722875.html">toxic locker room environment</a>, and quarterback Kirk Cousins <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-players-decline-2016.html/">looks downright awful</a> so far. If things don’t turn around in a hurry, it will be a really long season for the Skins.
<h2>22. New Orleans Saints (0-2)</h2>
At we said last week, the situation is what it is with the Saints. For them to have a chance at winning, quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-liability-players.html/">Drew Brees</a> and the offense must outscore their opponents on a weekly basis. When it comes down to it, we don’t see this team making a postseason run.
<h2>21. Oakland Raiders (1-1)</h2>
The Raiders actually <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-sleeper-teams-next-season.html/">played really well</a> on the offensive side of the ball in both of their games this season. However, on the other side of the ball, they are on pace to have one of the worst defenses in NFL history. For this team to get over the hump and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-raiders-make-playoffs-year.html/">compete for a playoff spot</a>, they must improve substantially at every level on the defensive side of the ball.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>20. Detroit Lions (1-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Matthew-Stafford_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="505" /> Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions looks on from the sidelines | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Based on what we’ve seen thus far, the Lions will be a difficult team to figure out in 2016. In Week 1, they looked like a potential surprise playoff team. Then, in Week 2, they let what should have been a comfortable win over the Tennessee Titans slip right through their fingers. The reality of the situation is that this is just an average football team at best.
<h2>19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-1)</h2>
One week after posting an impressive 31-24 road win over the Atlanta Falcons, the Buccaneers got completely dismantled by the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 40-7 in Week 2. This team, particularly quarterback Jameis Winston, is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rising-stars-nfc.html/">incredibly talented</a>, but needs more time to develop before they can be considered a legitimate threat in the NFC.
<h2>18. Atlanta Falcons (1-1)</h2>
The Falcons responded to their Week 1 home loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by traveling all the way across the country and posting a 35-28 win over the Oakland Raiders. The Atlanta defense needs to get better in a hurry for them to make a playoff run, but this team has one of the best offenses in the league.
<h2>17. San Diego Chargers (1-1)</h2>
The Chargers should be 2-0 right now. After their collapse against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 1, San Diego somehow found it within themselves to bounce back and completely humiliate the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 38-14 in Week 2. When this team has healthy offensive and defensive lines, they are a force to be reckoned with.

<h2>16. Baltimore Ravens (2-0)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692087" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Justin-Tucker-Baltimore-Ravens.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="505" /> Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens celebrates after hitting a field goal in 2015 | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

The Ravens have done just enough to win their first two games of the season. Based on what we’ve seen so far, Baltimore’s defense is substantially better than last season. Still, this team will only go as far as quarterback Joe Flacco <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-dont-want-2016-fantasy-team.html/">can take them</a>.
<h2>15. Dallas Cowboys (1-1)</h2>
The Cowboys squandered away an excellent chance at getting a divisional win over the New York Giants in Week 1, but they avoided <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/dallas-cowboys-repeat-mistakes.html/">making the same mistake</a> in Week 2 by defeating the Washington Redskins 27-23. When they are at the top of their game, the Dallas offensive line is the best in the business.
<h2>14. Kansas City Chiefs (1-1)</h2>
The Chiefs lacked running back Jamaal Charles and outside linebacker Justin Houston in their 19-12 loss to the Houston Texans in Week 2. Needless to say, they could use both players back on the field as soon as possible. Until that happens the Chiefs will likely be nothing more than an <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-afc-west-predictions.html/">above-average football team</a>.
<h2>13. Philadelphia Eagles (2-0)</h2>
The Eagles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/philly-fans-carson-wentz-wagon.html/">put their faith</a> in rookie quarterback Carson Wentz. At this point, their gamble is paying off. Wentz has the look of a big-time starting NFL quarterback with multiple weapons to spread the ball around to. When he is paired with Philadelphia’s excellent defensive front seven, the Eagles appear to have everything in place to make a surprise run to the NFC Playoffs in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>12. Cincinnati Bengals (1-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675947" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675947" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/A.J.-Green-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="505" /> Wide receiver A.J. Green of the Cincinnati Bengals makes a catch for a touchdown | Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

The Bengals continue to have one of the most talented rosters from top to bottom in the entire league, but we just don’t see this team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-need-win-now.html/">getting over the hump</a> and making a splash when the postseason comes around. They will face a tough test this weekend when the Denver Broncos <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-denver-broncos-playoff-streak.html/">come to town</a>.
<h2>11. New York Jets (1-1)</h2>
The Jets are flat-out loaded with talent on both sides of the ball. If things ever truly click for them, this team has the ability to make some noise in the postseason. If they can stay healthy, this may be one of the few teams on the New England Patriots’ schedule that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worry-new-england-patriots.html/">can beat them</a>.
<h2>10. Houston Texans (2-0)</h2>
We still <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-feeling-pressure-play.html/">aren’t sold</a> on Brock Osweiler as a franchise quarterback, but we cannot overlook the talent on the Texans’ roster. Their defense has the ability to be <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-defenses-2016-17.html/">among the best in league</a>. They have multiple game-breaking playmakers on the offensive side of the ball as well. If Osweiler can play at a high level, this team has everything in place to contend for an AFC title in 2016.
<h2>9. Green Bay Packers (1-1)</h2>
We were <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/3-nfl-teams-go-undefeated-2016-17.html/">high on the Packers</a> all offseason. Up to this point, it looks like 2016 could be another frustrating season in Green Bay. Despite having Aaron Rodgers under center, the Packers have been incredibly average offensively. On the bright side, though, their defense looks much better than it was in 2015. If they can ever get things figured out on offense, the Packers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-now-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/">will be Super Bowl contenders</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Minnesota Vikings (2-0)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_699188" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-699188 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Sam-Bradford-Vikings.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="1024" height="682" /> Quarterback Sam Bradford of the Minnesota Vikings celebrates after completing a touchdown pass against the Green Bay Packers | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

The Vikings have been outstanding on the defensive side of the ball in both of their games this season. If newly-acquired quarterback Sam Bradford can build off the way he played in Minnesota’s 17-14 win over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night, we can totally see the Vikings making some noise in the NFC Playoffs -- if Adrian Peterson is able to come back from his meniscus injury.
<h2>7. Seattle Seahawks (1-1)</h2>
The Seahawks have Super Bowl aspirations in 2016. However, in their first two games, they only managed to score one offensive touchdown and 15 points. In Week 2, they suffered an embarrassing 9-3 loss to the lowly Los Angeles Rams. When their offense is that poor, it doesn’t matter how <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-defenses-top-teams.html/">good their defense is</a>. We can't take Seattle seriously as a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/toughest-divisions-nfl.html/">threat in the NFC</a>.
<h2>6. New York Giants (2-0)</h2>
The Giants went on a spending spree this past offseason with the goal of improving their defense. Simply put, it is paying off in a major way. The Giants won their first two games of the season by a total of four points; in our eyes, both games would have been losses last year. Based on what we've seen through two weeks, we expect the Giants to contend in the NFC in 2016.
<h2>5. Arizona Cardinals (1-1)</h2>
The Cardinals were one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-arizona-cardinals-need-worry.html/">most disappointing</a> teams in the league in Week 1, but the way they responded in Week 2 -- by completely dismantling the Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- tells us that Arizona has what it takes to make another deep playoff run this January. This is still arguably the most talented roster in the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Carolina Panthers (1-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_700078" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-700078" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Devin-Funchess-of-the-Carolina-Panthers.jpg" alt="2016 NFL Power Rankings: Week 3 Edition" width="757" height="441" /> Devin Funchess of the Carolina Panthers salutes the crowd after scoring a touchdown against the San Francisco 49ers | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Panthers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-week-1-nfl-upsets.html/">lost a close game</a> on the road to the Denver Broncos in Week 1. However, in Week 2, they quickly reminded us that they are still one of the premier teams in the NFL. Carolina throttled the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 46-27. Quarterback Cam Newton is still <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/highest-paid-nfl-players-2016.html/">playing at an MVP level</a>; wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin looks like the playmaker on the outside that the team desperately needed in 2015; and their defensive front seven may be the best in the league. Right now, we see the Panthers as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-bold-predictions-for-the-carolina-panthers-in-2016.html/">best team</a> in the NFC.
<h2>3. New England Patriots (2-0)</h2>
The Patriots suffered a serious blow when quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo went down with an injury to his right (throwing) shoulder. They will get Tom Brady back in two weeks, but in the meantime, New England must go with rookie Jacoby Brissett, who is unproven and raw. On a positive note, New England’s defense looks vastly improved. When <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-patriots-win-super-bowl-51.html/">Brady returns</a> to the field, they will likely be the best team in the league.
<h2>2. Denver Broncos (2-0)</h2>
The Broncos don’t seem to get the credit they deserve from other media outlets, but their dominance hasn’t slipped past us. Their defense is on track to be one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-defenses-top-teams.html/">greatest defenses in NFL history</a> (for the second year in a row), and their offense is actually massively better than it was in 2015. If quarterback Trevor Siemian can grow throughout the season, a repeat Super Bowl title isn’t out of the realm of possibilities for Denver in 2016.
<h2>1. Pittsburgh Steelers (2-0)</h2>
The Steelers are the best team in the National Football League right now. Their offense may be the greatest in the league, even without running back Le’Veon Bell and wide receiver Martavis Bryant, who are both serving suspension for substance abuse violations. While their defense isn’t exactly dominant, it is strong enough to enable the Steelers to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pittsburgh-steelers-win-super-bowl.html/">go on a run</a> to the seventh Super Bowl title in franchise history.

		<description><![CDATA[The New England Patriots are always Super Bowl favorites, but what does 2016 look like for them? Let's get a bit bold about Tom Brady and company.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_594676" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594676" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bill-Belichick-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images-640x435.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the New England Patriots in 2016" width="757" height="515" /> Head coach Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/new-england-patriots/" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a> have become <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-the-patriots-are-still-the-team-to-beat-out-of-the-afc.html/" target="_blank">a staple of consistency</a> and success over the past 15 years. During that time, the team has not only made the playoffs in every year except two, but they've won four Super Bowls while making it to two more along the way.

The team's combined regular-season record over the 15 years? A ridiculous 182-58. It's tough to get much better than that, as this team has failed to win double-digit games just once over that span, finishing with a 9-7 record back in 2002. It's been the Bill Belichick and Tom Brady show, and it will continue rolling in 2016.

While the Patriots are always a Super Bowl favorite, we're going to make a few bold predictions for the team this year, touching on how we think New England will do without Tom Brady for the first four games. Let's kick things off there, because there's no better player to talk about right now than Jimmy Garoppolo.
<h2>1. Jimmy G goes 4-0</h2>
[caption id="attachment_552347" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-552347" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jimmy-Garoppolo_Peter-Aiken_Getty-Images-640x470.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the New England Patriots in 2016" width="757" height="556" /> Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo of the New England Patriots | Peter Aiken/Getty Images[/caption]

Let's be honest here: prior to kickoff, you could have made a convincing argument for the Arizona Cardinals in their opening game against the Patriots on their home field.  In fact, it wouldn't have been terribly surprising to see the Cardinals starting out 5-0 on the season, but (obviously) that wasn't meant to be, as  Garoppolo lead the Patriots to a victory on the road against the Cardinals.

Then, he'll help the Pats knock off the Miami Dolphins, Houston Texans, and Buffalo Bills to start out 4-0 before it's Brady's time to return. Garoppolo will make himself some serious money during that stretch, winding up with a nice chunk of change in the coming seasons. Way to go, Jimmy, you got the Patriots off and running to start the 2016 season.

<h2>2. Rob Gronkowski matches career high in touchdowns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_559987" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-559987 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Rob-Gronkowski_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the New England Patriots in 2016" width="757" height="555" /> New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Not only will Rob Gronkowski lead the league in touchdowns, but he'll match his career best, which occurred back in the 2011 season. At that time, Gronk scored 17 touchdowns and finished with career-bests in receptions (90), and yards (1,327). It was a superb season for the Pro Bowl tight end, but it's also the last season he was healthy.

Gronkowski missed at least one game in each of the next four seasons while suffering multiple injuries, with some being more serious than others. Sure, he will take some big hits (and he missed Week 1 with a hamstring issue), but overall this season his health doesn't seem to be much of a concern.

This alone makes him one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-offensive-weapons-afc-east.html/" target="_blank">most dangerous players in the NFL</a>, and he seems poised to be in for a gigantic season. But just how gigantic are we talking? We believe it'll be the best of his career, and that he'll not only top the 1,327 yards from 2011, but also match his 17 touchdown total.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Tom Brady tops 4,000 yards... in 12 games</h2>
[caption id="attachment_587035" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587035" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the New England Patriots in 2016" width="757" height="504" /> Quarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

In case you want the math, if Brady wants to top the 4,000-yard mark in the 12 games he'll likely play, that's an average of 333.3 yards-per-game. Yes, that's a ton of yards in fewer games, but let's consider his numbers from 2015.

While Brady threw for 4,770 yards, he also topped 333 yards in five games and finished with 466 against the Buffalo Bills. The Patriots spent plenty of time ahead last year, but let's also not forget the multiple injuries that the team dealt with last year, which may have caused a bit of adjustment on Brady's end.

One big player who's returning for the Patriots is running back Dion Lewis. In just seven games last year -- prior to suffering a torn ACL -- Lewis caught 36 passes for 388 yards and two scores. He will be a massive piece of the passing game for New England and a key reason why Brady will pick apart defenses during his 12 games in 2016. Another 4,000-plus yard passing season for Tommy B? You bet.

		<description><![CDATA[These are our NFL predictions for the 5 teams that must be on upset alert during Week 2 of the 2016 season. Surprises happen all the time in the NFL.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[If <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-injuries-week-1-nfl.html/" target="_blank">Week 1</a> was an accurate indication, fans of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-power-rankings-week-2.html/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> are in for an excellent season in 2016. We saw several thrilling finishes, numerous amazing individual performances, and, of course, some surprising upsets. Speaking of surprises, we have identified five games on the Week 2 schedule where we believe the underdogs have an excellent chance at prevailing, despite what the oddsmakers in Las Vegas think. Last week, we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/potential-week-1-nfl-upsets.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">went 4-1 in our upset picks</a>, and while we cannot guarantee a similar result this week, we are fairly confident in our picks for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-running-backs-week-two.html/" target="_blank">Week 2</a>. These are our NFL predictions for Week 2.

<em>Note: All picks are against the spread (ATS).</em>
<h2>1. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-0) over Arizona Cardinals (0-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_666133" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-666133" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jameis-Winston_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="NFL Predictions: The Arizona Cardinals need to be on upset alert in Week 2." width="757" height="504" /> We are going to learn a lot about Jameis Winston and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2 | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Point spread</u>: Cardinals favored by 7 points</li>
 	<li><u>Over/under</u>: 50</li>
 	<li><u>Location</u>: University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.</li>
</ul>
Other games may receive more hype, but this <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/preseason-nfc-south-predictions.html/">NFC</a> matchup between a reigning powerhouse and a team on the rise is one of the best games of the weekend in our eyes. While we still firmly believe that the Cardinals have a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-power-rankings.html/">championship-caliber roster</a>, this is a game we see being decided by a touchdown or less.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-defenses-2016-17.html/">Arizona defense</a> was far from dominant in their Week 1 loss to the New England Patriots, and the Tampa Bay offense is one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-sleeper-teams-next-season.html/">most talented groups</a> in the league. But when it comes down to it, the matchup that will likely decide the outcome of this game is the Cardinals offense versus the Buccaneers defense. If Tampa Bay can slow down running back David Johnson and keep the Cardinals’ dynamic trio of wide receivers (Larry Fitzgerald, John Brown, and Michael Floyd) in check -- which won’t be easy -- they will undoubtedly cover the point spread if not win this game outright.

<h2>2. Atlanta Falcons (0-1) over Oakland Raiders (1-0)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674016" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674016" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Julio-Jones_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="NFL Predictions: The Oakland Raiders need to be on upset alert in Week 2." width="757" height="505" /> If Julio Jones is healthy, he is in for a big day against the Oakland Raiders | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Point spread</u>: Raiders favored by 4.5 points</li>
 	<li><u>Over/under</u>: 49</li>
 	<li><u>Location</u>: O.co Stadium in Oakland, Calif.</li>
</ul>
If nothing else, this game should be highly entertaining for fans of offensive football. Neither team is particularly strong on the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-with-trouble-on-defense.html/">defensive side of the ball</a>, but both teams have the talent on the offensive side of the ball to consistently light up the scoreboard.

We expect the Raiders to ride the high of their Week 1 road win over the New Orleans Saints, but at the same time, this game is almost a must-win for the Falcons, who dropped their season opener at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The key to this game is the health of Atlanta’s best player and wide receiver Julio Jones. If he is healthy -- which he <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/09/09/julio-jones-ready-to-go-for-week-one/">says is the case</a> -- the Oakland secondary will be in for a long day. We believe the Falcons will come away with a much-needed road win over the Raiders in Week 2.

<h2>3. Jacksonville Jaguars (0-1) over San Diego Chargers (0-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_666118" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-666118" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Blake-Bortles_Charlie-Crowhurst_Getty-Images-1-1024x705.jpg" alt="NFL Predictions: The San Diego Chargers need to be on upset alert in Week 2." width="757" height="521" /> The pressure is on Blake Bortles to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to a win in Week 2 | Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Point spread</u>: Chargers favored by 3 points</li>
 	<li><u>Over/under</u>: 47</li>
 	<li><u>Location</u>: Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego</li>
</ul>
This game will be a good indicator as to whether or not the Jaguars are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-sleeper-teams-next-season.html/">legitimate playoff contenders</a> in 2016. They played the Green Bay Packers tough in Week 1, but came up just short. The bottom line here is that they are a more talented team (on paper) than the Chargers.

San Diego took a serious hit when they lost wide receiver Keenan Allen, and we can’t help but think that they still feel a little deflated after their embarrassing collapse against the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday. The only factors working against the Jaguars <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-week-2-games-no-one-cares.html/">in this matchup</a> are San Diego’s home-field advantage -- possibly the worst in the league -- and the fact that the trip from Florida to California can be draining. Nonetheless, we expect an outright win for the Jaguars this weekend.

<h2>4. Philadelphia Eagles (1-0) over Chicago Bears (0-1)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_697208" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-697208" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wentz-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images-1024x719.jpg" alt="NFL Predictions: The Chicago Bears need to be on upset alert in Week 2." width="757" height="532" /> Football fans will get their first up-close look at Carson Wentz in Week 2 | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>Point spread</u>: Bears favored by 3.5 points</li>
 	<li><u>Over/under</u>: 41.5</li>
 	<li><u>Location</u>: Soldier Field in Chicago</li>
</ul>
Simply put, the Eagles couldn’t have asked for a better schedule to start the season as they continue to break in rookie quarterback <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/philly-fans-carson-wentz-wagon.html/">Carson Wentz</a>. Behind a strong performance out of Wentz as well as their underrated defense, Philadelphia pounded the Cleveland Browns in Week 1. Given the issues <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-takeaways-week1.html/">that the Bears face</a> -- especially along their offensive line and all over their defense -- we believe that the Eagles will go into Chicago and beat them outright on Monday Night Football.

<h2>5. Kansas City Chiefs (1-0) over Houston Texans (1-0)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_606622" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-606622" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Alex-Smith_Sean-M.-Haffey_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="NFL Predictions: The Houston Texans need to be on upset alert in Week 2." width="757" height="505" /> Alex Smith has owned the Houston Texans in the past | Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
 	<li><u>P<u>oint spread</u></u>: Texans favored by 2.5 points</li>
 	<li><u>Over/under</u>: 43</li>
 	<li><u>Location</u>: NRG Stadium in Houston</li>
</ul>
This game should be a must-watch for all NFL fans. Both teams are coming off of impressive wins in Week 1, and both are also out to prove that they are among the top contenders <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-afc-west-predictions.html/">in the AFC</a>. As of now, Houston is the more complete team (the Chiefs will again miss outside linebacker Justin Houston and running back Jamaal Charles), but we can’t help but flash back to the AFC Divisional game between these two teams last year and think that the Chiefs match up well with the Texans.

For Kansas City to win, they need to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-defenses-top-teams.html/">put consistent pressure</a> on Houston quarterback Brock Osweiler; they need running back Spencer Ware to have another standout performance; and lastly, they need quarterback Alex Smith to continue playing at a Pro Bowl level. We believe all of these things are attainable.

		<description><![CDATA[The Chicago Bears have released Robbie Gould, their longtime kicker and one of the best in NFL history. Here are the top 10 most accurate kickers.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_692086" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692086" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Blair-Walsh-Chicago-Bears.jpg" alt="Top 10 Most Accurate NFL Kickers of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Kicker Robbie Gould of the Chicago Bears gives instruction to a teammate | Kena Krutsinger/Getty Images[/caption]

The Chicago Bears released longtime place kicker Robbie Gould back in September, and though it's easy to forget now, with him went the final link to a different era in Bears football history. Gould was the last player on the roster who was a member of the 2006 Super Bowl team that lost to the Indianapolis Colts, and the highest-scoring player in Bears franchise history. He’s not the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rumors-players-cut-training-camp.html/">most surprising player to be cut</a>, but it’s still worth noting. All good things must come to an end, and there’s a good chance he’ll continue playing somewhere else at just 34 years old -- practically mid-career for some NFL kickers. After all, he’s been one of the best at his job in league history. Here are the 10 most accurate kickers of all time, among players with at least 100 attempts.
<h2>10. Blair Walsh</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 84.2%

Heading into his fifth season in the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings, Blair Walsh had developed into one of the very best in the game in regards to both his accuracy and for hitting the long ball. He’led the league in field goals made twice in his first four years; had made a field goal of 56 yards twice; and on attempts 50 yards or longer was an extremely good 24-for-34 -- or about 71%.

Then Walsh, like plenty of other folks, realized that 2016 sucked. Back in November -- after missing four extra points and four field goals -- he was <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000740131/article/minnesota-vikings-release-kicker-blair-walsh">unceremoniously cut from the team</a> and remains a free agent.
<h2>9. Robbie Gould</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 85.4%

As previously noted, Robbie Gould is the leading scorer in Chicago Bears franchise history. He was originally signed back in 2005 at the age of 24 after having spent some time working in construction. He made a name for himself in his second season -- the one where the Bears made the trip to the Super Bowl -- by leading the league in field goals made with 32 and by hitting 88.9% of them. He developed the ability to hit longer field goals later in his career, too. The Bears only asked him to attempt two beyond 50 yards in his first four years, but he was 23-for-29 on them in his last seven seasons.

<h2>8. Shayne Graham</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692089" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692089" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Shayne-Graham-Atlanta-Falcons.jpg" alt="Top 10 Most Accurate NFL Kickers of All Time" width="757" height="600" /> Shayne Graham (R) of the Atlanta Falcons kicks a field goal off a hold by Matt Bosher | Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 85.5%

Shayne Graham is the definition of a journeyman, making an appearance with 10 different teams in his 14-year career to this point. He spent seven years with the Cincinnati Bengals, which was his longest stint in any one spot, before bouncing around since 2010. Graham isn’t much of a distance kicker, at just 17-for-31 from 50 yards or longer, but on field goals 49 yards or shorter he has hit at an 88.9% rate. For a guy who's moved around a ton, that’s really impressive.
<h2>7. Rob Bironas</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 85.7%

Rob Bironas played nine seasons in the NFL, all with the Tennessee Titans, from 2005<span class="s1">–</span>13. He led the NFL in both field goals made and attempted in 2007, hitting 35-for-39 and at 89.7%. As far as other stats go, he was 315-for-317 on extra-point kicks in his career, but just three-for-five on field goal kicks in the postseason. Bironas would’ve been 36 had he chosen to continue his career in the NFL in 2014, but he retired after hitting 25-for-29 in 2013.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Nate Kaeding</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692088" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692088" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Nate-Kaeding-San-Diego-Chargers.jpg" alt="Top 10 Most Accurate NFL Kickers of All Time" width="757" height="506" /> Kicker Nate Kaeding of the San Diego Chargers looks on from the sidelines | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 86.2%

Nate Kaeding played the bulk of his career with the San Diego Chargers, from 2004–11 before finishing up with five games split between the Chargers and Miami Dolphins in 2012. He was an excellent marksman in his career in San Diego, hitting on 87% of his attempts in a Charger uniform. He led the league in made field goals with 32 in 2009 and was still a high performer until losing the entire 2011 season after getting injured on the opening kickoff of the very first game.
<h2>5. Mike Vanderjagt</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 86.5%

Mike Vanderjagt’s first real game on an NFL field was in 1998, when he was already 28 years old. But he was great from the start with the Colts, coming to the team the same year that they drafted Peyton Manning. He was a big part of their offense in the early Manning years, including in 2003 when he was 37-for-37 on field goals and 46-for-46 on extra-points. His last year in Indianapolis was in 2005, before he moved on to play one season with the Dallas Cowboys before retiring.

<h2>4. Steven Hauschka</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692360" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692360" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Steven-Hauschka-Seattle-Seahawks.jpg" alt="Top 10 Most Accurate NFL Kickers of All Time" width="757" height="585" /> Kicker Steven Hauschka of the Seattle Seahawks warms up prior to the game against the San Francisco 49ers | Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 87.0%

Steven Hauschka wasn’t a regular in his career until his fourth season, landing with the Seattle Seahawks. In his first three seasons, with the Baltimore Ravens and Denver Broncos, Hauschka got into just 21 total games and hit just 16-for-22 on field goals, or about 72.7%. In his last five seasons in Seattle, however, the 31-year-old Hauschka has hit on 88.8% of his field goals and looks to have several more years remaining in his kicking leg. The highlights of his career to this point are making a 58-yard field goal in 2014 and winning a Super Bowl.
<h2>3. Stephen Gostkowski</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 87.5%

In 2006, 22-year-old Stephen Gostkowski arrived with the New England Patriots; one of the rare NFL kickers who was actually drafted. The Pats took Gostkowski in the fourth round that year, and he hasn’t been a disappointment Since his second year in the NFL, Gostkowski has hit on 253 of 293 field goal attempts, good for 86.3% accuracy over that stretch. Now at 32 years old, Gostkowski is still with the Patriots and has hit on 24 of 26 field goals in the postseason, winning a Super Bowl in 2014.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Justin Tucker</h2>
[caption id="attachment_692087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-692087" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Justin-Tucker-Baltimore-Ravens.jpg" alt="Top 10 Most Accurate NFL Kickers of All Time" width="757" height="505" /> Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens celebrates after hitting a field goal in 2015 | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 88.0%

In the last four years with the Ravens, Justin Tucker has become well-known for accuracy, distance, and frequency on his kicks. He’s led the NFL in attempts twice, made field goals once, and has a 61-yarder under his belt. He’s already made 132 field goals in his career, or about an average of 32 per year, and has never missed on an extra-point attempt (140-for-140).
<h2>1. Dan Bailey</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career FG</span>: 90.8%

Dan Bailey is the most accurate field-goal kicker in NFL history, but undoubtedly some fans will only remember the one-for-three performance in his first playoff game in 2014. However, that’s not a fair representation of how good the 28-year-old Bailey has been in his short Cowboy career, hitting 148-for-163 and 23-for-31 on field goals 50 yards or longer. He was 30-for-32 in 2015, leading the NFL in field-goal percentage at 93.8% and building some distance between he and Tucker in the all-time accuracy leaderboard. He continued that strong showing in 2016, going a perfect four-for-four in the Cowboy's home opener against the Giants.

			<title>NFL: 5 Most Important Players Suspended in 2016</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The NFL handed its fair share of suspensions for the 2016–17 season, but these 5 suspended NFL players will miss games and majorly impact their teams.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The NFL has handed out its fair share of suspensions for the 2016 NFL season. While some of the suspended NFL players will miss more time than others, there's no question that the absences will heavily impact teams. No suspension is likely as well-documented as New England Patriots <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/how-tom-bradys-reinstated-suspension-affects-the-rest-of-the-nfl.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">quarterback Tom Brady</a>. We're going to look at the five biggest, most important suspended NFL players in 2016. There's no better place to start than with Brady and the Patriots.
<h2>1. Tom Brady, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_624625" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-624625" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady is one of the most important suspended NFL players in 2016." width="757" height="489" /> Tom Brady focuses during a game against the Texas Houstons | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

This offseason, Brady officially decided to give up the "Deflategate" fight, and simply accept the four-game ban that was handed down to him over a year ago. While he was originally expected to take the four-game suspension in 2015, he fought it out like the competitor he is, and it was in turn pushed back to 2016.

Apparently, the battle wasn't worth it, as this was the last remaining piece of the scandal that lingered. Now, the Patriots will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/patriots-concerns.html/">lack their leader</a> throughout the rest of the 2016 offseason, including training camp and the first four games of the season.

The games Brady will miss include a few tough ones against the Arizona Cardinals, Miami Dolphins, Houston Texans, and Buffalo Bills. While the Patriots defeated the Cardinals handily, those other three games will be major battles (save the Dolphins, perhaps), and it's not out of the question that Brady could return to a 2-2 or even 1-3 potential record. If this becomes the case, it will be an interesting uphill climb for the Patriots.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Le'Veon Bell, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_511089" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-511089" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LeVeon-Bell.jpg" alt="Le'Veon Bell is one of the most important suspended NFL players in 2016." width="757" height="552" /> Le'Veon Bell goes for it | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

While Le'Veon Bell pushed to get his four-game suspension dismissed (it was reduced to three), it's certainly an interesting situation. Bell was handed the suspension for missing a required drug test. In turn, Stan Savran of <a href="http://espnpgh.iheart.com/media/play/27178217/" target="_blank">970 ESPN Radio</a> pointed out that Bell stated he changed his phone number recently, which is why he missed the drug test. That may be a fair reason for missing a drug test, but it's unlikely that the NFL would do much with this information, as Bell was already in the league's drug-testing program.

Essentially, lacking Bell in the lineup will be tough for the Steelers, but it's something the team dealt with over the past years. Through his three seasons with Pittsburgh, Bell has played in 16 games just once, in 2014, while missing 13 games during the other two respective seasons. It's a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-offensive-weapons-afc-north.html/">tough blow</a>, but it means that DeAngelo Williams will once again have a hefty amount of work on the field.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Josh Gordon, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497417" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497417" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Josh-Gordon_Browns1.jpg" alt="Josh Gordon is one of the most important suspended NFL players in 2016." width="757" height="561" /> Josh Gordon makes a catch | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Welcome back, Josh Gordon. Of every suspension on this list, there is probably none as exciting for the fanbase as this one. When the Browns discovered that Gordon would return after a four-game suspension in 2016 (although he missed the entire 2015 season), they were met with a ton of excitement.

Gordon broke out in a massive way in 2013, catching 87 passes, for 1,646 yards, and nine touchdowns in 14 games. Unfortunately, he played in just five games in 2014.

Regardless, his upside is essentially incredible, and now he'll get to play with his old friend Robert Griffin III, as Charlotte Wilder of <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/josh-gordon-locker-next-to-rgiii-changed-man" target="_blank">For The Win</a> points out. Has Gordon really turned the corner? If so, then the Browns offense just got a whole lot more interesting, and may actually be pretty dangerous this coming season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Martavis Bryant, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_572779" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572779" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Martavis-Bryant_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Martavis Bryant is one of the most important suspended NFL players in 2016." width="757" height="485" /> Martavis Bryant takes a breather | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Oh, Martavis. So much upside, yet the trouble lingers. As Marc Sessler of <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000643984/article/martavis-bryant-suspended-minimum-one-season" target="_blank">NFL.com</a> reported, Bryant is not only suspended for the entire 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17 season, but possibly even longer. This isn't the first time he's been suspended either, as he has now violated the league's substance abuse policy multiple times. Bryant was suspended for four games in 2015, and the same issues will force him out this year.

Will he be gone even longer than a year? It'll be an interesting situation to monitor, but at the very least, the Steelers won't have their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-best-offensive-weapons-afc-north.html/">home-run hitter</a> in 2016. Bryant has played in just 21 career NFL games, totaling 76 receptions, for 1,314 yards and 14 touchdowns. If he can stay away from the off-field issues, Bryant could still be in for a massive NFL career.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Vontaze Burfict, Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594832" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594832" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Vontaze-Burfict-Wild-Card-Round-Pittsburgh-GWqxqFIS_Pll.jpg" alt="Vontaze Burfict is one of the most important suspended NFL players in 2016." width="757" height="505" /> Vontaze Burfict argues a call | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Unlike the four names above, Vontaze Burfict's suspension is just a bit different. The Bengals linebacker will miss three games to start this coming season due to what Chris Wesseling of <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000621200/article/vontaze-burfict-suspended-three-games-will-appeal" target="_blank">NFL.com</a> called "repeated violations of safety-related playing rules." This came after the hit that concussed Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown in the wild-card round of the 2015–16 playoffs. It was a direct helmet-to-helmet hit -- pretty scary to watch.

Burfict will return earlier than the other names on this list, but his absence in the Bengals' lineup will impact a team who has their eye on making a playoff run this season.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_743613" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743613" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Ray-Lewis-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Ray Lewis #52 leads the Ravens on the field. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

At the start of any given play, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> linebacker stands ready within five yards of the line of scrimmage, runs full speed ahead at the snap of the football, and tees off on any opponent who dares to cross his path. To intimidate and lay down the law, the greatest linebackers in the league’s history were unreal combinations of size, strength, and athleticism, wrapped up in garish shoulder pads, fiberglass casting, and a mangled football helmet that has lived through metaphoric trench warfare. These defensive mavens often stared down the line of scrimmage showing no teeth and no mercy.

On top of their physicality, the greatest NFL linebackers of all time were also supreme tacticians. As a virtual coach on the field, a top linebacker would anticipate offensive play calling, flow to the football, and execute a textbook tackle on the ball carrier. Through anticipation, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound beast appears even faster and more intense — when he sells out his body from sideline to sideline.

Top linebackers, of course, were playmakers, who could put points on the board in their own right. The greats were always at the right pace at the right time for bone jarring hits, interceptions, strip sacks, and fumble recoveries that converted defense into offense. Throughout its history, the NFL has seen many great individuals at the linebacker position. However, in our opinion, these 10 players stand out among the rest.

<h2>10. Bobby Bell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743619" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743619" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Bobby-Bell-Joe-Kohen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Joe Kohen/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Hall of Famers showing off their rings. | Joe Kohen/Getty Images[/caption]

Bobby Bell (third from left) was one of the greatest athletes to ever play professional football. At the high school and collegiate level, Bell was an award-winning halfback, quarterback, and tackle. As a University of Minnesota tackle, Bell actually finished in third place in the 1962 Heisman Trophy voting. After college, he was drafted by the 1963 AFL Kansas City Chiefs. At that time, it was somewhat of a surprise that the AFL would win out against the NFL in a bidding war for players.

At 6-foot-4, 228 pounds, Bell <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/sports/football/bobby-lee-bell-an-nfl-star-honors-his-father-by-accomplishing-one-more-goal.html" target="_blank">reportedly clocked a 4.4 in the 40-yard dash while wearing tennis shoes</a>. His combination of size and speed helped blaze the trail for the likes of Charles Haley, Derrick Thomas, DaMarcus Ware, and Lawrence Taylor. As a hybrid defensive end/outside linebacker, Bell could rush the passer, control the edge, and drop back into coverage. In pass coverage, Bell was at his best, as he recorded 26 interceptions for 6 touchdowns <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BellBo00.htm" target="_blank">over his 12-year career with the Chiefs</a>. Before retiring, Bell went on to win two AFL titles and one Super Bowl championship.
<h2>9. Junior Seau</h2>
The late Junior Seau was the reason that USC went on to supplant Penn State as Linebacker U. for today’s generation of football fans. Seau was the torchbearer for the Club 55 group of USC backers, which included the likes of Jack Del Rio, Willie McGinest, Chris Claiborne, and Keith Rivers among its ranks. Beyond the No. 55 jersey, USC has also sent Lofa Tatupu, Brian Cushing, Clay Matthews, and Rey Maualuga off to play NFL ball on Sundays, after following in the footsteps of Seau’s time on campus and timely mentorship.

In San Diego, Chargers fans delightfully exclaimed that Junior made opponents say “ow" at the point of attack. With his speed and anticipation, Seau was a tackling machine who went on to <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SeauJu00.htm" target="_blank">record over 100 tackles in six consecutive seasons between 1991 and 1996</a>. Because of his quickness in space, Seau could slide past pulling guards to stuff inside handoffs behind the line of scrimmage, and also flow outside to chase down pesky scat backs on the toss sweep. Seau quickly emerged as a lock for the Pro Bowl, making the trip to Hawaii every year from 1991 to 2002. He was eventually inducted in the Hall of Fame in 2015.

<h2>8. Willie Lanier</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmvZqsgspyU"></iframe>
<a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?player_id=122" target="_blank">According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, Willie Lanier was the first African-American to start at middle linebacker in professional football. At middle linebacker, Lanier quarterbacked the defense for his Kansas City Chiefs <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LaniWi00.htm" target="_blank">between 1967 and 1977</a>. Lanier, alongside the aforementioned Bobby Bell, and Jim Lynch, formed one of the most devastating linebacking units in the history of football.

In 1969, Willie Lanier’s emotional leadership sparked his defense to a goal line stand versus the Jets in the AFL Divisional Playoffs. After the Jets settled for a field goal, Lanier’s Chiefs went on to a 13-6 playoff win en route to their Super Bowl IV title. In the Super Bowl win over the Vikings, Lanier put on an epic defensive performance — with 7 tackles and 1 interception. Because of his primetime heroics, Lanier was referred to as “Contact" for his fearsome hits and scare tactics that broke the collective will of an opposing offense. At 6-foot-1 and 245 pounds, Lanier often led with his helmet to de-cleat ball carriers and bury them into the ground.
<h2>7. Ray Nitschke</h2>
Ray Nitschke was your classic NFL goon and <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=165" target="_blank">a complete linebacker</a>. Imagine a 6-foot-3 man wearing a No. 66 Packers jersey, who wags an unforgiving finger on the Frozen Tundra of Lambeau Field — with a toothless scowl. Orphaned at three and from a working-class Chicago suburb, Nitschke was quick to deliver a forearm shiver and brawl at the point of attack. As a bully, he also appeared hell-bent on redirecting his childhood turmoil into a source of physical pain for any opponent.

Between the tackles, Nitschke controlled the front-seven for Vince Lombardi during a dynasty run that resulted in three NFL Championships and the first two Super Bowl victories. For Nitschke, the dominance included his very own MVP performance in the 1962 NFL Championship Game, when he recorded several tackles, two fumble recoveries, and one batted ball that led to an interception and a 16-7 win versus the New York Giants.

<h2>6. Mike Singletary</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lXGldL5xiSo"></iframe>
Mike Singletary was the face of the 46 Chicago Bears defense run by coordinator Buddy Ryan. In this scheme, the Bears overloaded the line of scrimmage in all out attack mode — so Singletary could roam free and take out the trash. As a 6-foot, 230-pound bowling ball of intensity, Singletary owned the box from tackle-to-tackle to blast ball carriers into the next week. Over the course of his 12-year career, Singletary earned <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SingMi00.htm" target="_blank">10 consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl alongside two AP Defensive Player of the Year awards</a>.

With the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1985.htm" target="_blank">1985 Bears</a>, Singletary helped limit offenses to a miserly 12.4 points per game and steamroll opponents to a 15-1 record. In Super Bowl XX, Singletary reveled in his type of party, when he put in work to shut down the overmatched Patriots in a 46-10 blowout. To this day, the '85 Bears are often referred to as the greatest defensive team of all time.
<h2>5. Jack Ham</h2>
Jack Ham was the most technically proficient linebacker of all time. As an outside linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ham was never out of position, maintained his discipline in gap contain, and tackled with textbook form at the point of attack. Ham’s technical know-how and workman-like approach to the game of football were the perfect fit for the blue collar Steel City. In 1975, Ham was rewarded for his efforts — with his lone Defensive Player of the Year award as a member of the Steel Curtain.

Jack Ham was at his best in pass coverage because of his speed and knowledge to play the angles. Over his 12-year career, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HamxJa00.htm" target="_blank">Ham snagged 32 interceptions </a>– often after baiting quarterbacks to throw the football into the flat where he lay in wait. Ham’s two interceptions versus the Oakland Raiders in the 1974 AFC Championship will go down in Pittsburgh lore as the beginnings of the Steelers’ Dynasty.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Jack Lambert</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e8Lo1sAzOkU"></iframe>
At middle linebacker, Jack Lambert set the tone for the gritty Pittsburgh Steel Curtain. As an eight-year captain, Lambert held court over a cast of characters that included the aforementioned Jack Ham, alongside L.C. Greenwood, Mean Joe Greene, and Mel Blount. In the huddle, Lambert commanded respect due to his fearlessness and tenacity, which more than made up for his lack of size.

Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing in at a relatively light 220 pounds, Lambert prided himself upon taking on blockers and dishing out punishment. In the running game, Lambert was prone to launch himself into the action and crumple opponents into the ground, before standing over them with a menacing glare and authoritative finger-point. When defending against the pass, Lambert had both the speed to go man-to-man with tight ends and running backs, and the awareness to sit back in the soft zone to crush wide receivers across the middle. In drop back coverage, Lambert’s soft hands took down 28 interceptions <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LambJa00.htm" target="_blank">over the course of his 11-year career</a>.
<h2>3. Ray Lewis</h2>
Ray Lewis was a machine. In Baltimore, he was the traditional centerpiece for a Ravens franchise that has prided itself on stout defense. At 6-foot-1 and 250 pounds, Lewis was arguably the most physically gifted linebacker to ever suit up in the NFL. Because of his combination of lateral quickness and strength, Ray-Ray was unblockable in the box and literally ran downhill to punish running backs in the hole. Mentally, he was a natural born leader who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyC96pCnw08" target="_blank">rallied the troops to give up everything that they had</a>, right then, and right there.

Lewis was a defensive coordinator in a linebacker’s body. Through careful study, the self-proclaimed God’s Linebacker was always one step ahead of the competition. In the clutch, he rose to the occasion to diagnose plays, stuff the run, bat down passes, and get stops. As an enforcer, Lewis often threw down the gauntlet to hammer split ends across the middle and swing the momentum in his favor.

In 2000, Lewis willed his Baltimore Ravens to their first Super Bowl Lombardi Trophy. With an inconsistent Trent Dilfer at quarterback, Lewis commandeered a unit that recorded four shutouts while limiting opponents to a measly 10 points per game. In the Divisional Playoff game against the Titans, Lewis bodied up against Eddie George in man-to-man pass coverage, before intercepting the football and rumbling 50 yards to the house for six.

In 2012, Lewis’s career ended with a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8912407/2013-super-bowl-ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-ends-brilliant-career-championship" target="_blank">34-31 victory</a> over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII.

<h2>2. Dick Butkus</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743671" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743671" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Dick-Butkus-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="557" /> Dick Butkus (L) on the Bears sideline. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

With his buzz cut, reliability, and proclivity to inflict pain, Dick Butkus (left) was a true Monster of the Midway. <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=39" target="_blank">Throughout his career</a>, Butkus stalked the line of scrimmage in his oversized No. 51 jersey and grotesque padding — to blow up ball carriers and strike fear in the hearts of the opposition.

Unfortunately, Butkus was never part of a winning regime during his time with the Chicago Bears. Yet, as the team’s lone playmaker, Butkus was still able to answer the bell time and time again. Between 1965 and 1972, Butkus was sent off to the Pro Bowl after each season and was recognized as a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/ButkDi00.htm" target="_blank">first-team All-Pro on five separate occasions</a>.

In 1973, Butkus fell victim to his own recklessness and the limitations of medical science of the day. Felled by injuries, he retired from the game of football as the greatest middle linebacker of all time — having mastered his position with a controlled rage.
<h2>1. Lawrence Taylor</h2>
Lawrence Taylor was an unreal combination of size, strength, and speed who was in full-blown attack mode at all times. Beyond his natural physical and mental capabilities, L.T. entrusted his services to the New York Giants organization and the coaching of resident evil geniuses Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick. Backed by the perfect storm of prowess, intensity, and strategy, Taylor was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year three separate seasons, and took home League MVP honors in 1986.

As a ruthless pass rusher, not only was Taylor built to wreak havoc, but No 56 also mastered the timeless art of the strip-sack, where he would crush a pocket passer and hammer out the football in one fell swoop; a play which usually resulted in him scooping up the loose ball and galloping toward the end zone for six. As a sack artist, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylLa00.htm" target="_blank">L.T. finished up his career with 132.5 sacks</a> -- tied for 13th all time.

Due to his explosiveness and power, Taylor was a match-up nightmare for bulky offensive tackles and pesky blocking backs alike. In fact, former Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs went on to popularize the use of H-backs, two tight-end sets, and single-back formations, in his own desperate attempt to confuse and contain this freak show. In the end, however, nothing worked against Taylor. It was impossible to scheme against this kind of greatness.

		<description><![CDATA[The road to Super Bowl LI projects to be rough and bumpy for these 7 teams. They better step up when it matters most or they'll face the consequences.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Several factors play a major role in the success of NFL franchises. One of the biggest is scheduling. We’ve known the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-10-must-watch-games-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">2016 opponents for every team</a> in the National Football League for quite some time now. And back in April we learned exactly when each game would fall on the 256-game regular-season <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> schedule.

We already gave you a look at the teams that were fortunate enough to land the league’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-with-the-most-favorable-schedules-next-season.html/" target="_blank">most favorable schedules</a>, and today we look at the teams that unfortunately came away with the toughest schedules in the league for 2016.

Again, we considered several dynamics, including strength of schedule (combined 2015 winning percentage of all 2016 opponents), short weeks (defined as missing at least one day of rest/practice), home/road stretches, and when/where certain teams fall on the schedule. With that being said, here is a look at the seven teams with the most difficult schedules in 2016.
<h2>Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/JJ-Watt_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Who Has the Toughest Schedule in 2016?" width="757" height="508" /> J.J. Watt of the Houston Texans | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.484 (t-19)

If you looked strictly at their strength of schedule, you would have to like the Texans' chances at making a return trip to the AFC Playoffs in 2016. However, with a closer look, you will find that the Texans have four short weeks -- which puts them in a tie for the most in the league -- and road games against the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/new-england-patriots/" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/minnesota-vikings/" target="_blank">Minnesota Vikings</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/denver-broncos/" target="_blank">Denver Broncos</a>, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/green-bay-packers/" target="_blank">Green Bay Packers</a>. And if that weren’t enough, the AFC South should be a much more competitive division after the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/bell/2016/03/12/jacksonville-jaguars-salary-cap-malik-jackson/81699072/" target="_blank">offseason additions the Jacksonville Jaguars</a> made and with the return of quarterback Andrew Luck for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/indianapolis-colts/" target="_blank">Indianapolis Colts</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brandon-Marshall-Eric-Decker_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Who Has the Toughest Schedule in 2016?" width="758" height="485" /> Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker of the New York Jets | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.531 (t-7)

When you consider all possible factors, the Jets may have the toughest schedule in the league. Outside of having to play the New England Patriots twice, the Jets will also have to deal with four short weeks; back-to-back road games against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals; a brutal five-game stretch of games against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Seattle Seahawks, the Steelers, the Cardinals, and the Baltimore Ravens; and a season-opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. Based off of this schedule, we have a difficult time envisioning "Gang Green" landing a spot in the AFC Playoffs in 2016.
<h2>Oakland Raiders</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.500 (15)

The Raiders are a team that many people believe is on the rise. And it’s easy to see why. In addition to having an excellent, young core (quarterback Derek Carr, wide receiver Amari Cooper, and defensive end Khalil Mack), Oakland has also had an excellent offseason this year, adding players such as offensive guard Kelechi Osemele, cornerback Sean Smith, and outside linebacker Bruce Irvin.

However, a more in-depth look at their schedule reveals that the Raiders may find themselves on the outside looking in when the AFC Playoffs arrive next January. In addition to two games against both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs, they will play five early-afternoon games -- which equates to <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/schedulereleasex160415/winners-losers-2016-nfl-schedule" target="_blank">five kickoff times of 10 a.m.</a> for the Pacific time zone-based Raiders -- in addition to having games against the New Orleans Saints, Houston Texans, Carolina Panthers, and Indianapolis Colts. All said, with this schedule, we have a hard time seeing the Raiders winning enough games to contend for a playoff spot in 2016.

<h2>New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_591692" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-591692" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x445.jpg" alt="NFL: Who Has the Toughest Schedule in 2016?" width="757" height="526" /> Tom Brady of the New England Patriots | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.523 (9)

The Patriots are currently the <a href="https://www.sportsbook.ag/sbk/sportsbook4/nfl-betting/2017-nfl-futures-2017-super-bowl-li.sbk" target="_blank">odds-on favorites</a> to win Super Bowl LI, but they don’t have an easy path ahead of them. Outside of the New York Jets, who will be a tough matchup, the Patriots shouldn’t have much of an issue within their division. Outside of the AFC East will be another story, though.

They will have road games against the Arizona Cardinals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Denver Broncos, and will host the Houston Texans, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Seattle Seahawks. With that slate of games, the Patriots have their work cut out for them to land one of the top two seeds in the AFC Playoffs. That said, they will undoubtedly be battle-tested heading into the postseason.
<h2>San Francisco 49ers</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.555 (t-1)

The last thing that a team in rebuilding mode needs is one of the toughest schedules in the league, but that is exactly what the NFL handed the 49ers. Their divisional schedule (two games each against the Seattle Seahawks, the Arizona Cardinals, and the Los Angeles Rams) will be difficult in itself. Then, on top of that, when you factor in games against the Carolina Panthers (on the road), the New England Patriots, the Dallas Cowboys, the New Orleans Saints, and the Atlanta Falcons (on the road), it becomes clear that 2016 could be a long season for the 49ers.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628171" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628171" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Carson-Palmer_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x445.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="526" /> Carson Palmer of the Arizona Cardinals | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.531 (t-7)

In 2015, the Cardinals proved that they were one of the premier teams in the NFL. And while we still believe that they should be considered legitimate Super Bowl LI contenders, their schedule actually has them set up to take a step backwards in 2016. There will be the standard two games against their division rival Seattle Seahawks in addition to tilts with the New England Patriots, the New York Jets, the Carolina Panthers (on the road), the Minnesota Vikings (on the road), the Atlanta Falcons (on the road), and the New Orleans Saints. We still like the Cardinals to make it to the NFC Playoffs this year, but our guess is that due to their schedule, it will be as a wild-card team.
<h2>Atlanta Falcons</h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Strength of Schedule (NFL rank)</span>: 0.555 (t-1)

Based on strength of schedule alone, the Falcons have the most difficult roster of games in the league for the 2016 season. And after looking closer, it goes beyond strength of schedule. Aside from two games against the defending NFC champion Carolina Panthers, the Falcons have road games against the Oakland Raiders, Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks, and Philadelphia Eagles, and home games against the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals, and Kansas City Chiefs.

The most daunting part of the Falcons’ schedule, though, is the stretch from Week 4 through Week 6, when they will play the Panthers at home, and the Broncos and Seahawks on the road. With this schedule, it will be incredibly hard for the Falcons to close the gap on the rest of the NFC and make a return trip to the postseason.

		<description><![CDATA[There will always be undervalued fantasy football players before the start of the season, and these 5 names look primed to fill that role.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[While we all love to talk fantasy football, and chat up the top-tier studs such as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-adrian-peterson.html/" target="_blank">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-cam-newton.html/">Cam Newton</a>, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-outlook-antonio-brown.html/">Antonio Brown</a>, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/11-most-irreplaceable-players-in-the-nfl.html/">Julio Jones</a>, today we're going to go a bit of a different route. There are plenty of players out there who deserve some love in the fantasy football world, especially in point-per-reception (PPR) leagues. When looking at the average draft position (ADP) of the players currently on Fantasy Pros, there were plenty that stood out as being majorly undervalued. So, we're going to look at five undervalued fantasy football players heading into the upcoming season.

What better way to kick it off with a superb talent at the wide receiver position for the Seattle Seahawks? No, we aren't talking Doug Baldwin.
<h2>5. Tyler Lockett, WR, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568342" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568342" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tyler-Lockette_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Undervalued Fantasy Football Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Tyler Lockett making a move on the ball with Seattle | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

It took just one comment from Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll to grab the attention of the fantasy football world. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Mathews/status/743552175452758016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Liz Mathews of 710 ESPN</a>, Carroll said that Lockett is "much more than just special teams" and is, in fact, a starting wideout for the squad.

That pretty much nails the popular opinion, but could we potentially see him in a much larger role by the time the 2016-17 season rolls around? Lockett caught almost everything that came his way in 2015, totaling 51 catches on 68 targets, good for 664 yards, and six touchdowns. He also scored two special teams touchdowns. There's no question that he's just starting to show his true potential. Currently, he's listed as the WR35 in PPR leagues, which seems way too low if we're being honest. Expect Lockett to exceed expectations and have a big 2016-17 season after another full offseason to work with Russell Wilson.

<h2>4. Dorial Green-Beckham, WR, Tennessee Titans</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Dorial-Green-Beckham-Frederick-Breedon-Getty-Images-2.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Undervalued Fantasy Football Players in 2016" width="757" height="518" /> Dorial Green-Beckham dives to the end zone against the Jacksonville Jaguars | Frederick Breedon/Getty Images[/caption]

Maybe the Green-Beckham hype is the wrong one to buy into, but we're doing it. This guy has some ridiculous physical skills and raw talent. Once that all comes together, he's going to have the potential to be one of the best wide receivers in the league. Recently, quarterback Marcus Mariota told <a href="http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-4/Three-Quick-Hits-from-Tuesdays-OTA-Practice/342d68f7-7d6d-4b36-9738-a0e4b66c061a" target="_blank">the team's official site</a> that Green-Beckham is a "stud."
<blockquote><span style="line-height: 1.5">“The dude is a stud,’’ quarterback Marcus Mariota said of Green-Beckham. “Physically, he is very gifted. He made a couple of plays today that’s going to be needed. So hopefully we can find ways to get him the football and let him do his thing.”</span></blockquote>
Green-Beckham showed serious flashes during his rookie season, as he caught 32 passes for 549 yards and four touchdowns. He's able to do a little bit of everything, and his game against the Jacksonville Jaguars last season, in which he caught five passes for 119 yards and a touchdown truly showed the upside that he has.

This is a player who's way down there in fantasy rankings, coming in at WR44 and the No. 103 overall ranked player.

<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5">3. Ryan Mathews, RB, Philadelphia Eagles</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_571959" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-571959" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ryan-Matthews-Rich-Shultz-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Undervalued Fantasy Football Players in 2016" width="757" height="558" /> Ryan Matthews getting every inch out of a run | Rich Schulz/Getty Images[/caption]

The Eagles have a new head coach in Doug Pederson, the former Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator. We know what Pederson is capable of doing with talented running backs, as he helped both Spencer Ware, and Charcandrick West have great seasons after Jamaal Charles got hurt in 2015. Now, he gets to work with Mathews, in a situation where DeMarco Murray is no longer in the picture.

This could very well become the best season of Mathews' career, yet he's ranked as the RB25, behind plenty of options that we'd take him ahead of. This includes, Miami's Jay Ajayi, Chicago's Jeremy Langford, Cleveland's Duke Johnson, and even Murray, who's with the Titans now.

Mathews received only 106 carries last year, but averaged 5.1-yards-per-carry, scored six rushing touchdowns, and also caught 20 passes as well. He's going to be a huge part of Philadelphia's offensive gameplan in 2016, making him a great fantasy option.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jarvis Landry, WR, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_569012" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-569012" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jarvis-Landry-Rob-Foldy-Getty-Images-640x460.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Undervalued Fantasy Football Players in 2016" width="757" height="544" /> Jarvis Landry takes a breather | Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

This could be a year where Landry finally breaks out. He was an absolute PPR monster last season, catching 110 passes for 1,157 yards. The downside? He caught just four touchdowns. Even with that said, he was still one of the top-10 scoring wide receivers in PPR leagues. Landry should have no problem finding the end zone more than four times next season, and we expect to see him become a top-five fantasy wide receiver.

In turn, this makes his ranking as the No. 18 WR and No. 30 overall player just too low. Obviously, wide outs are valuable in PPR leagues, especially guys like Landry, but he should be ranked higher than this. Some may not agree, but when you manage to see 165 targets in a season, you're obviously doing something right. Landry's targets should go up next season, and in turn, his receptions, yards, and touchdowns will as well.

<h2>1. Doug Martin, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_601097" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-601097" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Doug-Martin_Dilip-Vishwanat_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Undervalued Fantasy Football Players in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Doug Martin eyes the end zone | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

After two rough, injury-filled seasons, Martin finally bounced back to the player we saw in his rookie year during his 2015 campaign. Martin posted his best yard-per-carry average at 4.9, while totaling 1,402 rushing yards, six rushing touchdowns, and catching 33 passes for an additional score. There's obviously some concern that Charles Sims will take away touches from Martin, but we don't see Martin losing much of his ground game work, due to the type of talent that he is.

Martin is currently listed at RB11, behind Eddie Lacy. The fact is, if Martin can find the end zone more than six times in 2016 (which seems likely), then he's going to wind up as a top-five or six running back next season. The upside is there, and the more that the Buccaneers can do to help take pressure off Jameis Winston and the passing game, the better.

The greatest NFL players of all time each left their respective marks upon gridiron lore, and indisputably changed the game. Above all else, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-tom-brady-now-the-greatest-quarterback-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">the greats were winners who appeared much bigger, faster, and stronger than their contemporaries</a>, due to their uncanny ability to both diagnose and anticipate plays and to arrive at the right place at the right time. Offensively, the best of the best were threats to score, from any position on the field, at any moment. Defensively, the greats relied upon instinct to shut out and beat down the opposition into the next week.

In a team sport, of course, the best players do not exactly perform as individual talents, who can be most often found by pouring over NFL combine statistics. To win, cohesion and team play must take priority above the “me first, get me the ball” diva mentality. Beyond the field, the greats were typically locker room leaders who promoted a winning culture, brought younger players into the fold, and decisively dealt with any internal distractions. Otherworldly talent combined with the will to win often resulted in Super Bowl trophies, Hall of Fame busts, and dynasties.

If you were to put together an NFL team for the ages, it might look something like this.

<h2>Offense</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705400" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-705400 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51550838.jpg" alt="Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images" width="756" height="624" /> Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Quarterback — Joe Montana:</strong> With four Super Bowl trophies, “Joe Cool” was the ultimate winner. Joe Montana and his quiet confidence have earned the respect of all who have followed the game of football.

<strong>Running Back — Walter Payton:</strong> Classic Walter would take the hand-off, bowl through arm tackles at the line of scrimmage, and bounce to the outside. From there, it was off to the races, with Payton refusing to go out of bounds. Instead, “Sweetness” would often lower his shoulder to bowl over defenders and finish off runs.

<strong>Fullback — Jim Brown:</strong> Jim Brown was actually listed as a fullback in his day. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowJi00.htm" target="_blank">In 1965,</a> Jim Brown retired, having owned all rushing records at that time. In today’s game, Jim Brown would perform as the power back, in a thunder and lightning backfield duo.

<strong>Wide Receiver — Jerry Rice:</strong> “The San Francisco Treat” dominated his position like no other. Somewhat similar to Brown, Jerry Rice also retired having owned every significant receiving record. Rice, of course, was also known for his tireless fitness regimen and work ethic.

<strong>Wide Receiver — Don Hutson:</strong> In this lineup, Hutson would star as the perfect complement to Rice as a possession receiver. Don Hutson led the NFL in both receptions and yardage for seven out of his 11 seasons in the NFL. Don Hutson’s career spanned from <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HutsDo00.htm" target="_blank">1935 to 1945</a> and he is often hailed as the man who ushered the league into the modern era through the forward pass.

<strong>Tight End — John Mackey:</strong> The athletic John Mackey would often work special teams for the Baltimore Colts as a kick returner. In 10 years, Mackey racked up <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MackJo00.htm" target="_blank">331 catches for 5,236 yards and 38 touchdowns</a>. The statistics calculated out further to 15.8 yards per catch, which will always be unheard of for a tight end.

<strong>Left Tackle — Anthony Muñoz:</strong> At left tackle, Muñoz was the greatest offensive lineman of all time, and the total package of size, strength, athleticism, and technique. Muñoz would often wall his man off at the line of scrimmage for two solid counts and throw him onto the ground before rumbling downfield to lead a convoy of Bengals for big gains.

<strong>Left Guard — Randall McDaniel:</strong> Randall McDaniel dominated the line of scrimmage for the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers between 1988 and 2001 as a relatively cut specimen. McDaniel’s athleticism was on full display in Minnesota, where he would often lead as a pulling guard to kick out linebackers and clear out space for the likes of Robert Smith. McDaniel made the Pro Bowl for 12 straight years, from 1989 to 2000.

<strong>Center — Mike Webster:</strong> “Iron Mike” emerged as the greatest center of all time, after leading his Pittsburgh offensive line throughout the ’70s Dynasty and into the late ’80s.

<strong>Right Guard — John Hannah:</strong> <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=88" target="_blank">John Hannah</a> may have arguably performed as the most technically sound offensive linemen to ever play the game of football. As a Patriot, the 6-foot-2, 265-pound Hannah made up for his lack of size through technique and sheer willpower.

<strong>Right Tackle — Eric Williams:</strong> Eric Williams was a devastating blocker, who was the unsung hero of the 1990s Dallas Cowboys dynasty. As the strongest man in a game of strong men, Williams would embarrass the competition by mauling defensive ends at the point of attack before moving on to the second level linebackers and defensive backs. For his part, teammate Emmitt Smith closed out his career atop the running back leaderboard with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_career.htm" target="_blank">18,355 rushing yards</a>.

<h2>Defense</h2>
[caption id="attachment_713939" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-713939 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/160894788-e1413831641952.jpg" alt="Chris Graythen/Getty Images" width="757" height="512" /> Love him or hate him, there's no doubting prime Ray Lewis's ability and drive | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong>Middle Linebacker — Ray Lewis:</strong> Famous for proclaiming himself “God’s Linebacker,” Ray Lewis was the heart and soul of the Baltimore Ravens defense. Lewis relied upon sheer instinct and intelligence to blow up plays. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LewiRa00.htm" target="_blank">In 2012</a>, Ray Lewis retired after having won two Super Bowls.

<strong>Weak Side Linebacker — Lawrence Taylor:</strong> A total madman, LT led his pack of wild dogs through many a romp in New York City. Lawrence Taylor and his unreal combination of speed and size redefined the linebacker position. As an edge rusher, Taylor racked up <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylLa00.htm" target="_blank">132.5 sacks</a> during his playing career.

<strong>Strong Side Linebacker — Jack Ham:</strong> Ham was the most technically proficient linebacker of all time. Jack Ham especially excelled in pass coverage where he went on to snag <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HamxJa00.htm" target="_blank">32 interceptions</a> during his 12-year career.

<strong>Left Defensive End — Reggie White:</strong> “The Minister of Defense” is a master of the hump move. White will shrug his shoulders and deliver a forearm shiver to plow some right tackle sap out of the way. From there, it was on to the quarterback for his patented strip sack.

<strong>Left Defensive Tackle — Alan Page:</strong> At tackle, Alan Page relied upon quickness and tenacity to blow up plays. After walking away from the game of football, Judge Alan Page took his signature bow tie to the <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/?ID=30009&amp;page=31" target="_blank">Minnesota Supreme Court</a>.

<strong>Right Defensive Tackle — Mean Joe Greene:</strong> Greene was equally tenacious in both his running and passing games. The anchor of the Steel Curtain would pressure the A-gap between offensive center and guard, with his angular three-point stance. As an intimidator, Mean Joe Greene was the top cop on a team full of enforcers.

<strong>Right Defensive End — Deacon Jones:</strong> The late Deacon Jones literally invented the term “sack.” Certainly, Jones would have ranked as a top-five sack artist, had this statistic actually been recorded during his playing days. An unofficial record has Jones racking up <a href="http://www.101sports.com/2013/06/05/deacon-jones-if-sacks-were-stats-then/" target="_blank">173.5 sacks in 14 years</a>.

<strong>Cornerback — Deion Sanders:</strong> As a shutdown corner, the game plan for “Prime Time” is quite simple: Lock up against and take out the best receiver on the field. As an all-time great, Deion might also clock double duty on special teams as a return man.

<strong>Cornerback — Rod Woodson:</strong> Rod Woodson enhanced the versatility of the defensive unit, as he could line up at virtually any position. For Woodson, a typical day at the office may have included five tackles, one forced fumble, two interceptions, one sack, and, oh yes, one return touchdown.

<strong>Strong Safety — Ronnie Lott:</strong> As a tough guy, Ronnie Lott once had the tip of his pinky finger cut off just so that he could remain in the game. As a versatile defender, Lott made <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LottRo00.htm" target="_blank">multiple Pro Bowls</a> at both cornerback and safety for the San Francisco 49ers. Lott was known for his well-timed and jarring hits of diminutive wide receivers across the middle.

<strong>Free Safety — Ed Reed:</strong> In Baltimore, Reed starred as the ultimate centerfielder for the defense. In the secondary, an apparently listless Reed would bait a gunslinger quarterback to test him going deep. With the ball in the air, Reed would be on the move to jump the route and snag his latest pick. From there, he quickly transitioned into a return specialist, where he would high step behind a convoy of like-minded goons into the end zone for six.

		<description><![CDATA[With fantasy football drafts rapidly approaching, here is a look at 5 star players you don't want on your 2016 fantasy team.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_619126" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-619126" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ryan-Fitzpatrick_Jeff-Zelevansky_Getty-Images1-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="505" /> The New York Jets and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick are in a contract standoff. | Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> is far and away the most popular professional sports entity in the United States, allowing it to develop into a billion dollar industry. And one of the biggest reasons for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-10-must-watch-games-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">NFL’s prompt growth</a> is the rise in the worldwide popularity of fantasy football.

According to the <a href="http://fsta.org/research/industry-demographics/" target="_blank">Fantasy Sports Trade Association</a>, there were roughly 57.4 million people playing fantasy sports in 2015. Of those 56.8 million people, most of them said that fantasy football was their favorite fantasy sport.

With fantasy football drafts coming down to the wire and just hours before the first Thursday Night game, it’s time to start looking at which players to target and which players to avoid for the 2016 season.
<h2>1. Alshon Jeffery, WR, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_567154" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-567154 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Alshon-Jeffery_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="663" /> Chicago Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery will be a fantasy football bust in 2016. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>2015 Stats:</u>
<ul>
 	<li>54 receptions</li>
 	<li>807 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>14.9 yards per reception</li>
 	<li>4 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
First and foremost, there is no denying that Jeffery is one of the most physically talented wide receivers in the game. However, the 6-foot-4, 230-pounder has struggled to stay healthy throughout his four-year NFL career, and we simply don’t feel good about his situation in Chicago.

As we've learned throughout the years, wide receiver is a quarterback-dependent position, and Jeffery’s quarterback, Jay Cutler, may be talented, but he is also one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/bears-will-never-win-super-bowl-with-jay-cutler.html/" target="_blank">most erratic and inconsistent signal callers</a> in the league. Couple that with the fact that the Bears lost offensive coordinator Adam Gase to the Miami Dolphins, and you have the makings of a wildly unreliable fantasy football season for Jeffery in 2016.

<h2>2. C.J. Anderson, RB, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644462" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644462" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CJ-Anderson_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="505" /> Fantasy football owners shouldn't put too much faith in Denver Broncos running back C.J. Anderson in 2016. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>2015 Stats:</u>
<ul>
 	<li>152 carries</li>
 	<li>720 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4.7 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>5 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>25 receptions</li>
 	<li>183 receiving yards</li>
</ul>
Over the past two seasons, Anderson has proven that he can be a force -- and a borderline elite running back -- at the NFL level when he is fully healthy. The only problem is that he has yet to even come close to playing an entire season at full strength.

The Broncos did show their faith in the 25-year-old bruiser by <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-should-the-denver-broncos-do-with-cj-anderson.html/" target="_blank">matching the restricted free agent offer sheet</a> (worth $18 million over four years) that he signed with the Miami Dolphins this offseason, but that still doesn’t guarantee fantasy success for Anderson in 2015. The team also added one of the top running backs in the 2016 NFL Draft class in Devontae Booker -- who will likely steal at least five to 10 carries per game -- and re-signed veteran Ronnie Hillman.

While all signs point toward Anderson being the Broncos’ bell-cow running back in 2016, his health issues and the talent on Denver’s depth chart behind him make us extremely wary of his fantasy football potential this season.

<h2>3. Philip Rivers, QB, San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644968" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644968" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philip-Rivers_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images-640x469.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="554" /> San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers may struggle in 2016. | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>2015 Stats:</u>
<ul>
 	<li>66.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>4,792 passing yards</li>
 	<li>29 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>13 interceptions</li>
 	<li>93.8 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Simply put, the days of Rivers being a high-end fantasy quarterback are over. It’s not all his fault, though. While he is still a playoff-caliber starting quarterback, the Chargers have surrounded the 12-year NFL veteran with a subpar rushing attack and a mediocre offensive line.

To be fair, he still has tight end Antonio Gates, whose career is also winding down, and wide receivers Keenan Allen and Travis Benjamin, who are both explosive young players. But if they can’t keep their opponents off balance with some kind of running game, their offensive line will surely struggle against opposing pass rushes, and Rivers will spend a lot of time on his back or on the injury report in 2016.

<h2>4. Devonta Freeman, RB, Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_651454" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-651454" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Devonta-Freeman_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1-640x446.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="528" /> Expect to see Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman experience a dip in production in 2016. | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>2015 Stats:</u>
<ul>
 	<li>256 carries</li>
 	<li>1,056 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4.0 yards per carry</li>
 	<li>11 rushing touchdowns</li>
 	<li>73 receptions</li>
 	<li>578 receiving yards</li>
 	<li>3 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Devonta Freeman burst onto the NFL scene with authority in 2015. The former Florida State Seminole surprised everyone by earning second-team All-Pro honors after putting up over 1,600 total yards and 14 total touchdowns, despite starting the season as the Falcons’ second-string running back. Despite his impressive 2015 campaign, we see him taking a step back, statistically speaking, in 2016.

First of all, second-year pro Tevin Coleman, who was Atlanta’s starter heading into the 2015 season, is healthy and focused on winning his job back. Given Coleman’s explosiveness, it’s a near certainty that the team will want to give him at least 10 to 15 touches per game in 2016.

Secondly, it is highly unlikely that Freeman will come close to repeating a performance similar to what he did last year during Week 3 through Week 7, where he rushed for 578 yards and eight touchdowns on 109 carries and caught 27 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown. All said, don’t be surprised if Freeman proves to be a middle-of-the-road fantasy running back in 2016.

<h2>5. Joe Flacco, QB, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_555063" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-555063" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joe-Flacco_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Star Players You Don't Want on Your 2016 Fantasy Team for Fantasy Football" width="757" height="504" /> Fantasy owners should avoid Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in 2016. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

<u>2015 Stats:</u>
<ul>
 	<li>64.4% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,791 passing yards</li>
 	<li>14 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>12 interceptions</li>
 	<li>83.1 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>3 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
It’s no secret that we strongly consider Flacco to be one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/overrated-nfl-players.html/" target="_blank">most overrated</a> and overpaid players in the National Football League. And when it comes to fantasy football, we believe he brings even less value to the table.

For starters, he has never been the type of player to put up gaudy statistics, which is clearly evident by the facts that he has yet to post a 30-touchdown pass or 4,000-yard passing season, and that he has thrown 10 or more interceptions in each of his eight NFL seasons.

Furthermore, he just doesn’t have the offensive weapons at his disposal to be considered a trustworthy fantasy option in 2016. In fact, we wouldn’t even recommend drafting him as a backup at this point.

		<description><![CDATA[The 2016 fantasy football season is upon us, which means it's time to look at the top 10 fantasy football quarterbacks for the upcoming season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2016 NFL season starts today, which means that the long, brutal lull is close to being over. This means that it's time to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-dont-want-2016-fantasy-team.html/" target="_blank">start talking fantasy football</a>, which is one of the best parts of the build up to the NFL season. There's no question that being able to draft fantasy football teams helps make the final month or two of the offseason just a bit easier. So, we're going to look at each position for your fantasy football team and rank the projected top players as well. Here are the top 10 fantasy football quarterbacks.
<h2>10. Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589399" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589399" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Andy-Dalton-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Andy Dalton | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

We're starting things off with the "Red Rocket" himself. While Andy Dalton is flying a bit under the radar due to the injury that derailed his beautiful start to 2015, he will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-quarterbacks-who-will-have-the-best-2016-seasons.html/" target="_blank">bounce back nicely in 2016</a>. Dalton completed a career-best 66.1% of his passes for 3,250 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions through 13 games. He also posted a career-best 106.3 quarterback rating. Basically, it seems as though Dalton has finally put it all together and should be in for a huge year.
<h2>9. Ben Roethlisberger, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_588300" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-588300" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ben-Roethlisberger_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Ben Roethlisberger | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Another guy who dealt with his fair share of injuries, Ben Roethlisberger played in 12 games in 2015, but threw for nearly 4,000 yards (3,938 to be exact) and tossed 21 touchdowns. He did see a spike in his interceptions (up to 16), but we <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/14-quarterbacks-who-looked-elite-during-their-first-starting-seasons.html/" target="_blank">don't expect that to stick</a> for Big Ben this coming season. He usually goes fairly late in fantasy drafts, so you may get a steal here.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_556110" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-556110 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Drew-Brees_Saints.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="519" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Drew Brees may be 37 years old, but the man is the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-9-best-offensive-weapons-in-the-nfc-south.html/" target="_blank">definition of consistency</a>. He's thrown at least 32 touchdowns in each of the past eight seasons. In 2015, a year in which many believed he'd decline, Brees wound up throwing for 4,870 yards, 32 touchdowns, and just 11 interceptions. Another year of working with Brandin Cooks and the addition of Michael Thomas from Ohio State will only help him out as well. Brees should post huge numbers once again.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578796" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578796" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Russell-Wilson-Pete-Carroll_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

We nearly put Russell Wilson behind Brees, but his ability to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-the-2016-mvp-award.html/" target="_blank">get it done with his legs</a>, as well as the improvements he achieved in 2015, make him one of the most intriguing quarterbacks for fantasy this coming season. Wilson increased his completion percentage by five points last season to 68.1, while also topping 4,000 yards passing, throwing 34 touchdowns, and just eight interceptions. Wilson has never had an issue with interceptions, and we expect that to remain the same next year.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578997" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578997" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Andrew-Luck_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images-640x423.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="500" /> Andrew Luck | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Andrew Luck is back, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-bounce-back-injury-2016.html/" target="_blank">he's finally healthy</a>. Just a year removed from throwing for 4,761 yards and 40 touchdowns, Indianapolis's offensive leader couldn't stay healthy in 2015. He played in just seven games, throwing for 1,881 yards, 15 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. The good news? He'll be hungrier than ever this year, and while we don't expect to see a repeat of his 2014 season, he will still have a pretty superb year, and he will likely be one of the first fantasy football quarterbacks taken.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Blake Bortles, Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589977" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589977" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Blake-Bortles_Rob-Foldy_Getty-Images-640x457.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="541" /> Blake Bortles | Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

There's a good chance that we have Blake Bortles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/first-time-nfl-pro-bowl-players-2016.html/" target="_blank">higher than almost everyone</a> else out there. After a 2015 season in which he made a massive step forward, throwing for 4,428 yards and 35 touchdowns, we believe he's just beginning to show what he's capable of. With offensive weapons such as Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns, and Julius Thomas, it's hard not to like the weapons he has. To go along with that, the pairing of Chris Ivory and T.J. Yeldon in the backfield will only make his life easier in 2016. Grab Bortles in the middle rounds, and put a smile on your face when you do.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_598928" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598928" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Carson-Palmer-NFC-Championship-Arizona-Cardinals-s-7XTs4YGRBl-640x400-640x400.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="473" /> Carson Palmer | Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images[/caption]

Welcome to the elite level, Mr. Carson Palmer. After <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-should-the-cardinals-do-with-carson-palmer.html/" target="_blank">some pretty solid years</a> throughout his career, the 36-year-old quarterback broke through in 2015 in a big way. He threw for 4,671 yards, 35 touchdowns, and just 11 interceptions. Basically, Palmer was a player who teams drafted as their QB2 last season, and it paid off as one of the top fantasy football quarterbacks in the league. With Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, John Brown, and even running back David Johnson available as pass-catchers, expect another big season here.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658055" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658055" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Aaron-Rodgers_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1-640x440.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImaNFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016ges" width="757" height="520" /> Aaron Rodgers | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

When the Packers lost Jordy Nelson to a preseason ACL injury, many were concerned about Aaron Rodgers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-aaron-rodgers.html/" target="_blank">as a fantasy option</a> and about his team in general. While he didn't wind up having the best year of his career, he still threw for 31 touchdowns against just eight interceptions. Now, he gets Nelson back, and it's probably a safe bet that he's overly thrilled about it. Rodgers will go from being a strong fantasy quarterback last season to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-stats-greats.html/" target="_blank">being an elite one</a> in 2016. Best of all? He may even slide just a bit in fantasy drafts due to his 2015 campaign.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Tom Brady, New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594708" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594708" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x445.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="526" /> Tom Brady | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

For 38-year-old (soon to be 39) Tom Brady, age really is just a number. The guy is at the point where most quarterbacks would decline, but he completed 64.4% of his passes for 4,770 yards, 36 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions. Essentially, this was one of his best seasons as the Patriots quarterback, and betting on him to slow down sounds like a terrible idea. Brady <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-steals-nfl-draft-history.html/" target="_blank">will keep rolling</a>, and it's hard to not put him at No. 1 on this list.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Cam Newton, Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_610164" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-610164" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cam-Newton-640x441.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 10 Fantasy Football Quarterbacks for 2016" width="757" height="522" /> Cam Newton | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

Unfortunately, Cam Newton is the reason why Brady isn't No. 1 on the list. When you're coming off a season where you not only throw for 35 touchdowns, but rush for 10 more, it's hard to not put you at the top of the list.

Newton had a combined 4,473 passing and rushing yards, and his ability to beat teams with both his arm and his legs makes him downright scary for opponents. Oh, and it also makes him the best fantasy football quarterback in the game. Last season, Newton was a mid-round draft pick. This season, he'll probably be selected <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-cam-newton.html/" target="_blank">in one of the first two rounds</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Finding unknown star players is necessary for fantasy football success. Here are seven potential breakout fantasy football players for 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2016 <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> regular season now less than two weeks away, which means that time is running out to prepare for your <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-sleepers.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">fantasy football draft</a>. And while everyone wants to talk about the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-dont-want-2016-fantasy-team.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">big-name players</a> that will come off the board in the first couple of rounds, it’s the players that are typically later-round draft picks who come out of nowhere to post huge numbers that are typically the key factor to fantasy success.

Last year’s top breakout players were guys like Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman, Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley, Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson, and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Jarvis Landry. Who will be this year’s fantasy breakout players? Here’s our take on the situation.
<h2>1. Kevin White, WR, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_533333" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-533333 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kevin-White_Bears.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Kevin White could put up huge numbers for the Chicago Bears in 2016 | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

White, who was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, missed his entire rookie season after suffering a stress fracture in his shin that required surgery during training camp last August. And now that he is fully healthy, the former West Virginia Mountaineer is looking to prove that he was worthy of such a lofty draft position.

By all accounts, White has been a force throughout the Bears’ offseason and training camp, and in joint practice with the New England Patriots the 24-year-old wide receiver <a href="http://www.profootballweekly.com/2016/08/16/hub-arkush-kevin-white-puts-on-a-show-in-bears-patriots-practice/arlsvca/" target="_blank">reportedly stole the show</a>. While we know that Alshon Jeffery will command a huge number of targets, we fully expect Jay Cutler to look in White’s direction early and often in 2016. Additionally, if teams focus their attention on Jeffery, White should be in line to post monster numbers.

When it comes down to it, we are envisioning a 75-catch, 1,200-yard, 10-touchdown type of season out of White in 2016.

<h2>2. Jameis Winston, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_666133" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-666133" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Jameis-Winston_Hannah-Foslien_Getty-Images-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="800" height="533" /> Jameis Winston has the look of a big-time NFL quarterback | Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

Winston struggled at times as a rookie in 2015, but there were other times where he looked like a perennial Pro Bowler. And with a full year of experience and a full offseason program as the team’s starter under his belt, we believe the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner will elevate his game to the next level in 2016.

Winston should benefit from playing in a potentially explosive offense that shouldn’t change much as Dirk Koetter transitions from offensive coordinator to head coach. With that being the case, expect to see the former Florida State Seminole improve on his rookie stat line of 4,042 passing yards, 22 touchdown passes, and 15 interceptions and become a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lead-nfl-passing-yards-vegas-odds.html/" target="_blank">top-10 fantasy quarterback</a> in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Coby Fleener, TE, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659477" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659477" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Coby-Fleener-Indianapolis-Colts-1024x680.jpg" alt="ATLANTA, GA - NOVEMBER 22: Coby Fleener #80 of the Indianapolis Colts walks off the field after beating the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome on November 22, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Scott Cunningham/Getty Images)" width="757" height="503" /> Coby Fleener could have a huge season for the New Orleans Saints | Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

Fleener was forced to split time with Dwayne Allen for the last four seasons when both tight ends were members of the Indianapolis Colts, but now that Fleener has signed with the New Orleans Saints, he will his team’s unquestioned No. 1 tight end for the first time in his NFL career -- and we believe the former Stanford Cardinal is in line for a huge season, as he'll be playing in what will likely continue to be one of the most pass-heavy offenses in the NFL. Expect to see Fleener put up comparable numbers to  Jimmy Graham's time with the Saints in 2011-2014.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Dwayne Allen, TE, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687317" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687317" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Dwayne-Allen_Harry-How_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Harry How/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Dwayne Allen will be the featured tight end for the Indianapolis Colts in 2016 | Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

The other side of the coin in Indianapolis -- after sharing time with Coby Fleener for the last four seasons, Dwyane Allen will finally be the primary tight end for the Colts in 2016. And the fact that Indianapolis chose to keep Allen over Fleener tell us that they believe he can be an elite tight end in their pass-heavy offensive system.

Allen has averaged right around 23 receptions for 262 yards per and three touchdowns per season over the course of his career, and we are fully expecting those numbers to double, or maybe even triple, in 2016. All said, Allen is worthy of a middle round pick, but will likely be available at the tail end of most drafts.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Ryan Mathews, RB, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687421" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687421" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Ryan-Mathews_Rich-Schultz_Getty-Images-1024x1011.jpg" alt="Rich Schultz/Getty Images" width="757" height="747" /> Ryan Mathews could have a huge season in the Eagles' new offense | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

Mathews has had a couple of nice seasons during his six-year NFL career, but we think 2016 has the potential to be a monster year for the former first-round pick out of Fresno State. New Philadelphia head coach Doug Pederson has said that the team will use a committee at the running back position, but he also said that he knows he has to get the ball in Mathews’ hands.

As a refresher, Pederson is coming off of a stint as the offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs. And during his time in Kansas City, the 48-year-old coach got the most out of All-Pro running back Jamaal Charles, guiding the explosive tailback to two Pro Bowl selections and a first-team All-Pro selection in 2013.

If Mathews can stay healthy for the Eagles in 2016, we are expecting him to flourish in Pederson’s system. Don’t be surprised if he ends up posting career-highs in rushing yards, touchdowns, and receptions.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. David Johnson, RB, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687425" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687425" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/David-Johnson_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> If Bruce Arians is being honest, David Johnson could be the top fantasy running back in the league in 2016 | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Bruce Arians has been raving about Johnson’s ability all offseason, and while also making it clear that he plans to give the second-year running back a heavy workload in 2016. Knowing this, and based on the explosiveness Johnson flashed as a rookie in 2015, we believe that the former Northern Iowa running back has the potential to be the best fantasy running back in the league this year. Don’t be shocked if he ends up rushing for 1,200 or more yards and 10 touchdowns, and catching 60 or more passes for 500 or more yards in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. John Brown, WR, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_687427" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687427" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/John-Brown_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x713.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="527" /> Arizona Cardinals wide receiver John Brown could explode in 2016 | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Brown had a breakout season of sorts in 2015, catching 65 passes for 1,003 and seven touchdowns. We think those numbers will improve substantially in 2016. Brown will likely move into the role of No. 1 wide receiver for the Cardinals, which should equate to the third-year pro seeing 150 or more targets this year. If that truly proves to be the case, expect Brown to end up with 85 or more catches for close to 1,500 yards and double digit touchdowns.

		<description><![CDATA[It's fantasy football season! Let's break down the NFL's Week 1 start 'em and bench 'em list for the quarterback position.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the 2016 NFL season officially here, we've already talked <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/sleepers-target-2016-fantasy-football.html/" target="_blank">about sleepers</a> and broken down a bit of the Week 1 action. However, we're going to lock in on some season-long fantasy football tips for the opening week. Specifically, let's discuss the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-fantasy-football-quarterbacks-2016.html/">always interesting quarterback position</a>; which players will qualify as the start 'em options and who qualifies as the sit 'em options in Week 1. Let's kick things off with an injury-plagued player who had a brutal 2015 season.
<h2>Start 'em: Andrew Luck, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_578997" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-578997" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Andrew-Luck_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="500" /> Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts screams in frustration after fumbling away the ball against the New York Jets | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

Not only does Luck get a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-picks-nfl-comeback-player-year.html/">chance to redeem himself</a> after a rough 2015 outing, but he gets to do it in a game that should be quite the shootout. The Detroit Lions and Colts aren't exactly known for stellar defenses right now, and both he and Matthew Stafford (more below) should be poised to put up big numbers. We know how much the Colts love to throw the ball, and there's simply no reason to shy away from one of the best quarterback options of this week.
<h2>Bench 'em: Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628171" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628171" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Carson-Palmer_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="526" /> Carson Palmer looks for a target | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

It seems absolutely ridiculous to sit Palmer against the New England Patriots, and while it wouldn't be surprising to see him have a solid game, there are other players who we think may still be on your waiver wire who could produce even better. Palmer and the Cardinals are up against the Tom Brady-less Patriots, which means that New England's defense and run game must play a major role in this one. It won't end up being the crazy high-scoring affair that many people believe it will be. Palmer won't usually be listed as a "sit," but this week is the rare exception.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Start 'em: Derek Carr, Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_664170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-664170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Derek-Carr-Lachlan-Cunningham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="504" /> Derek Carr celebrates a win | Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

While the New Orleans Saints will feature an improved defense in 2016, it won't be enough to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-raiders-make-playoffs-year.html/">slow down Carr</a>. The third-year quarterback is rapidly improving, and that's bad news for every other team they face this season, including the Saints. Carr should become one of the top four fantasy scorers at quarterback in Week 1. If you have him in your mix of QBs currently, don't stress getting him locked into your lineup.
<h2>Bench 'em: Philip Rivers, San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_644968" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-644968" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Philip-Rivers_Mike-Ehrmann_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="554" /> Philip Rivers hopes for success | Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

People seem to be big believers in Philip Rivers this season, but unfortunately, you should probably hold off on him until Week 2 of the season. The Chargers not only open up their season against the Kansas City Chiefs, but they do so on the road. That's a brutal environment, as well as a ridiculously talented defense to go up against. If you have any pivot options (and you should), then jump on utilizing them over Rivers. Worst case scenario? Head over to the waiver wire and jump on a quarterback for this week, because we highly recommend avoiding Rivers.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Sleeper start 'em: Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_690854" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-690854" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Dak-Prescott-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="504" /> Dak Prescott is the man under center in Big D | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Let's say you have Rivers, or heck, even Brady who you're waiting on to return from suspension. This means you might want to hit the waiver wire and see what's out there. If you get the chance to land Dak Prescott and possibly toss him in your starting lineup for Week 1 against the New York Giants, it's definitely not a bad idea.

Now, we wouldn't recommend starting Prescott over many of your typical starting quarterbacks, but the Cowboys and Giants seem to always get into high-scoring games, and having Ezekiel Elliott should help to ease the pressure off Prescott. To go along with all that, he also has an elite wide receiver in Dez Bryant, who he's shown a strong connection with. Prescott is also capable of taking off and running as well. Sounds like a great sleeper option in Week 1.
<h2>Bench 'em: Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_582637" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-582637" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Matt-Ryan_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Week 1 Fantasy Football Start 'Em/Bench 'Em: Quarterbacks" width="757" height="512" /> Matt Ryan looks perplexed about his fantasy situation | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

It seems that, for some reason, the Matt Ryan hype train is back in full-go mode this offseason. Unfortunately, after a season in which Ryan underwhelmed us all by throwing just 21 touchdowns against 16 interceptions, we aren't loving him heading into the year. Tack on the fact that they're up against the division rival Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team who is massively underrated, and there's a strong argument for why you may want to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-feeling-pressure-play.html/">avoid using Ryan</a> this week. While having Julio Jones as your top wide receiver is a pretty nice selling point, there's plenty of pivots off Ryan who you should likely consider.

		<description><![CDATA[The AFC West has the potential to be one of the most exciting divisions in the NFL in 2016. These are our preseason AFC West predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl, holding off the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-denver-broncos-worried.html/" target="_blank">surging Kansas City Chiefs</a> in the AFC West. It was a pretty incredible way for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/peyton-manning-favorite-teams.html/" target="_blank">quarterback Peyton Manning</a> to ride off into the sunset. The question now: Can the Broncos win the division again and push to repeat as Super Bowl champions? The road won't be easy, so we're give some preseason AFC West predictions.

While we've already touched on a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-nfc-north-predictions.html/" target="_blank">few other divisions</a>, there's no question that the AFC West has many potential outcomes. This division could be one of the most entertaining aspects of the upcoming season. Here are our preseason AFC West predictions, starting with a general ranking of how we think this division will turn out:
<ol>
 	<li>Kansas City Chiefs</li>
 	<li>Oakland Raiders</li>
 	<li>Denver Broncos</li>
 	<li>San Diego Chargers</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
[caption id="attachment_615838" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-615838" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Alex-Smith_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC West Predictions" width="757" height="473" /> Quarterback Alex Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]
<p class="p1">The Kansas City Chiefs haven't finished first in the AFC West since 2010, but they have made the playoffs twice since then (2013 and 2015). Even with running back Jamaal Charles playing in only five games due to a knee injury, Kansas City still finished with an 11-5 record last season.</p>
<p class="p1">Quarterback Alex Smith excelled in a role where he wasn't asked to do much. He finally had a consistent, talented threat at wide receiver in Jeremy Maclin. This duo, paired with Charles and a ridiculously talented defense, will help the Chiefs <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-chiefs-will-make-the-playoffs-next-year.html/" target="_blank">take down this division</a> in 2016. There's a lot to like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-is-there-a-new-favorite-in-the-afc-west.html/" target="_blank">about the Kansas City Chiefs in 2016</a>, and we wouldn't be shocked to see them make a playoff run.<!--nextpage--></p>

<h2 class="p1">Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589976" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589976" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Oakland-Raiders_Huddle-640x435-640x435.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC West Predictions" width="757" height="515" /> The Oakland Raiders' huddle | Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

Here's where the real fun begins. While some believe that the Chiefs can get the job done and win the division, not many believe that the Raiders will be able to best the Broncos when all is said and done. However, we're on board with Oakland. Thanks to a pairing of Derek Carr and Amari Cooper, as well as an improved defense, the Raiders are not only talented enough to finish ahead of the Mark Sanchez-led Broncos, but also talented enough to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-start-2016-season.html/" target="_blank">make it back to the playoffs</a>.

The additions of both cornerback Sean Smith and linebacker Bruce Irvin will prove to be huge. This defense could really change the game for the Raiders. The franchise hasn't made the postseason since 2002, the year they lost the Super Bowl with Rich Gannon leading the charge. The 2016 season is when they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-improving-season.html/" target="_blank">get back into the fun</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Denver Broncos</h2>

Everyone will want to talk about Sanchez being the team's starting quarterback (as we just did above), but that's not the only aspect of the Broncos that needs to be factored in. Losing Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan really stings, and while the lack of both Manning and more specifically Brock Osweiler are huge, it's the combination of it all that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-denver-broncos-worried.html/" target="_blank">really hurts Denver</a>.

The Broncos will still be good, and it wouldn't be shocking to see them push for a wild card spot, but they <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-nfl-offseason-mistakes.html/" target="_blank">won't be able to bounce back</a> from the brutal 2016 offseason immediately. Give the Broncos a year to regroup and figure out the best route to move forward. This upcoming season just won't be their year.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590278" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590278" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Phillip-Rivers-San-Diego-Chargers-v-Minnesota-oZ6cnCXaapMl.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC West Predictions" width="757" height="483" /> Quarterback Philip Rivers of the San Diego Chargers | Adam Bettcher/Getty Images[/caption]

After five seasons straight of floating around the .500 mark, the Chargers finally saw their momentum swing. Unfortunately, it went in the wrong direction. The Chargers have finished no better than 9-7 in any season since 2010. Then they fell all the way to 4-12 last season and simply couldn't catch a break. While San Diego should be able to improve on their four wins from 2016, there's some bad news.

The rest of the division is rapidly improving, while they seem to be at a standstill. Philip Rivers is talented enough to win some games, and a healthy Keenan Allen will help out, but we aren't sold on this defense and their running game. Don't expect much out of the Chargers in 2016; they'll find themselves at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-lose-every-game-season.html/" target="_blank">bottom of the division</a> when all is said and done.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_666608" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-666608" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/LeVeon-Bell-Roosevelt-Nix-Pittsburgh-Steelers.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football: 3 First-Round Picks to Let Fall to Round Two" width="757" height="503" /> Running back Le'Veon Bell (R) of the Pittsburgh Steelers celebrates with running back Roosevelt Nix of the Pittsburgh Steelers after Bell scored the game-winning touchdown against the San Diego Chargers on October 12, 2015 | Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

It's always tough to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-dont-want-2016-fantasy-team.html/">avoid a well-known, popular NFL player</a> during the first round of your fantasy football draft. But as you let that superstar pass you, just remember that your first-round pick may very well make or break your entire team. The argument can be made that multiple rounds are the "most important," but it's truly tough to say that your first pick won't completely change the game.

Today we take a look at three first-round fantasy football draft picks that you should just avoid this season. All statistics are <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/adp/ppr-overall.php" target="_blank">from Fantasy Pros</a> and are based on 12-team leagues with point-per-reception (PPR) scoring. They've put in an average draft position based on multiple sites, so we'll look at that. Any player who has an average draft position (ADP) of 12 or lower, will be considered an option for this article. We begin with a player facing a four-game suspension to start the 2016 season.
<h2>1. Le'Veon Bell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_511089" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-511089" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LeVeon-Bell.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football: 3 First-Round Picks to Let Fall to Round Two" width="757" height="552" /> The Pittsburgh Steelers' Le'Veon Bell makes a break for it | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

If Le'Veon Bell wasn't <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/suspended-nfl-players-2016-season.html/">facing a three-game suspension</a>, he'd probably <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-mvp-candidates-afc.html/">be a top-three pick</a>. Now, his ADP is set at exactly 12. We're going to push him just a bit further back than that, though, and not just because of the suspension. While that obviously hurts and will make it tough for him to wind up as a top-six or -seven running back in 2016, the fact is, he's dealt with quite a few injuries in his young career as well.

Over just three seasons in the NFL, Bell has missed 13 games, while topping the 1,000-yard rushing mark one time. He's also never hit double-digit rushing scores. Now, obviously part of what makes <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pittsburgh-steelers-win-super-bowl.html/">this Pittsburgh Steeler</a> so appealing is his ability to catch passes, as he has 152 receptions through 35 career games. An early second-round pick? Sure, but we're going to let him slide a bit and jump on a name who's listed below him on this list or even a guy above him who may fall, such as <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rising-stars-afc.html/">Allen Robinson</a> or <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-running-backs-rushing-yards-leader.html/">Lamar Miller</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Adrian Peterson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_675734" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-675734" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Adrian-Peterson_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football: 3 First-Round Picks to Let Fall to Round Two" width="757" height="505" /> Adrian Peterson goes all out for the Vikings | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Let's just clarify something. Adrian Peterson will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-adrian-peterson.html/">go in the first round</a> of almost every fantasy football draft out there. He's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-running-backs-best-2016-seasons.html/">incredibly talented</a>, but in a PPR league, his value isn't nearly as high as a non-PPR league. While Peterson has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/">always been a bruising back</a>, his 30 catches for 222 yards in 2015 doesn't exactly blow you away.

In the 2016 season, more than any other, wide receivers have become even more valuable, which would make us want to lean more toward taking a player going below him, like Dez Bryant or Allen Robinson. Going along with that, we love the upside of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rising-stars-nfc.html/">Ezekiel Elliott</a> and Lamar Miller, who are typically being selected after Peterson. Taking all of this into account, Peterson's ADP of nine could be pushed outside of the first round, resulting in him being one of the first players selected in the second round.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Rob Gronkowski</h2>
[caption id="attachment_607678" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-607678" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Rob-Gronkowski_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football: 3 First-Round Picks to Let Fall to Round Two" width="757" height="555" /> Rob Gronkowski celebrates a successful play | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

It's pretty painful to say this, as Rob Gronkowski is far and away the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-fantasy-football-tight-ends-2016.html/">best tight end in the NFL</a>, and the best fantasy tight end as well. His ADP is currently 11.3, so he's actually right on that first-round fringe. With that said, if you're drafting at No. 10 or No. 11, could you let him slide back to you with the second or third pick in the second round? It's definitely possible. The thought of Tom Brady missing four games is pretty terrifying to some people, and as much as we hate to admit it, it'll hurt his stock a bit.

While Gronkowski will still be the top tight end in fantasy in 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17, his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/worst-injuries-nfl-preseason.html/">previous injury concerns</a> and not having Brady is a strong enough argument to see him go at the top of the second round as well. There's a lot of talent in the first round of fantasy drafts, and Gronkowski <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/11-most-irreplaceable-players-in-the-nfl.html/">is up there</a>, but you shouldn't be faulted for waiting to grab him early in the second.

		<description><![CDATA[Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was one of the best fantasy football running backs in 2015, but how will he finish up in 2016?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_659241" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659241" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adrian-Peterson_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-1-640x453.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Adrian Peterson" width="757" height="535" /> Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

As time goes on, things change in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/fantasy-football" target="_blank">fantasy football world</a>. One injury, one piece of news, or even one draft pick can change the entire landscape of expectations for the upcoming NFL season. While we've already touched on the projections for a few major players in the NFL, including <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-cam-newton.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">2015 league MVP Cam Newton</a>, it's time to shift our attention over to the NFL's rushing champion from last season, Adrian Peterson.

Last season, when evaluating running backs under the point-per-reception scoring, Sporting Charts <a href="http://www.sportingcharts.com/nfl/players/592914/devonta-freeman/#Rushing%20Yards$GameType=279588574&amp;SeasonMax=9999&amp;SeasonMin=1990" target="_blank">shows us</a> that Devonta Freeman was far and away the best fantasy football running back. He not only totaled 316 points (compared to No. 2 Peterson, who totaled 261), but averaged over 21 fantasy points per game as well.

So, with Peterson finishing at No. 2 overall in PPR scoring last year, the question now becomes, how will he finish up the 2016 season? We're going to get a bit more in-depth when talking Peterson, then break down the realistic expectation and predict how he'll finish compared to our other top-five running backs.

Let's clarify this before anything. What Peterson did in 2015 was nothing short of spectacular, amazing, and full of talent. When running backs hit the dreaded age of 30, they usually see a pretty major decline. For Peterson, he just went out and won the NFL's rushing title last season. It's a pretty shocking thing to see. He finished up the year with 327 rushing attempts, 1,485 yards, 11 touchdowns, 30 receptions, and 222 receiving yards.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Age is just a number for Peterson</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659239" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659239" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adrian-Peterson_Jamie-McDonald_Getty-Images-640x500.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Adrian Peterson" width="757" height="591" /> Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson | Jamie McDonald/Getty Images[/caption]

With that said, it's hard to doubt Peterson from an age standpoint, so what other reasons to we have to believe that he can't continue on this elite path? The Vikings are dedicated to getting him the ball, and after finishing No. 2 overall in PPR scoring -- where his receptions didn't play as much of a role as they did for other players -- we expect another big season for the superstar in 2016.

To tack on to that, let's not forget that this is a player who came into the 2015 season a bit rusty after missing all but one game in 2015 due to off-field issues. This means that Peterson now has another full offseason to prepare, and a full head of steam as well going into the year.

Peterson's game is unbelievable, to put it simply. The guy doesn't slow down, and has a motor that may never run out of juice. As <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2016/05/08/adrian-peterson-nfl-minnesota-vikings-texas-flood" target="_blank">Peter King of the MMQB</a> reported, Peterson openly stated that he wanted to play in the NFL until he was 40 years old. Is that realistic? Probably not, but if anyone can do it, it'd be Peterson.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Consensus</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659238" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659238" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Adrian-Peterson_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x479.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Adrian Peterson" width="757" height="567" /> Running back Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The Vikings running back stated the following: “I honestly think I can do this, and do it at a high level, until I’m 40.” Alright, then. That would literally be nine more seasons, but hey, fortunately we just need to focus on 2016 by itself, and we see big things in store for him.

While we don't expect him to be the No. 1 back -- he'll get just barely nudged out by a superb pass-catcher in Pittsburgh Steelers RB Le'Veon Bell -- don't be shocked when you see him come in as a close second.
<ol>
 	<li>Le'Veon Bell</li>
 	<li>Adrian Peterson</li>
 	<li>David Johnson</li>
 	<li>Todd Gurley</li>
 	<li>Ezekiel Elliott</li>
</ol>
As you can see, most of those backs are rookies or second-year players who are beginning to take the league by storm. Fortunately, we believe that Peterson and Bell will both be able to hold off those three names and keep their hold on the top two spots for 2016.

Expect Peterson to once again push for the rushing title, and possibly even win it, but fantasy success comes down to much more than just rushing yards, as we saw last season with Freeman.

		<description><![CDATA[Finding players in the late draft rounds is the key to fantasy success. Here are 7 fantasy football sleepers you should target in the 2016 fantasy draft.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-takeaways-week1.html/" target="_blank">preseason action in full swing</a> around the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, it’s time to start formulating a plan of action for your <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/players-dont-want-2016-fantasy-team.html/" target="_blank">fantasy football draft</a>. Whether you are a casual player who is simply aiming to win office bragging rights or a serious player who has hundreds or even thousands of dollars on the line, being prepared when draft day rolls around is an absolute necessity when it comes to fantasy football success.

Part of being ready is knowing which high-risk, high-reward players to target in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-6-rookies-with-the-most-fantasy-potential-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">middle and late rounds of your draft</a>. Fortunately, we have done the research for you. Here is a look at seven fantasy football sleepers you should target in the later rounds of your upcoming draft.
<h2>1. Mike Wallace, WR, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_684087" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684087" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Mike-Wallace_Dave-Reginek_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="757" height="505" /> Mike Wallace looks poised to have a big season for the Baltimore Ravens in 2016 | Dave Reginek/Getty Images[/caption]

After emerging as one of the premier deep threats in the league during his time with the Pittsburgh Steelers (2009<span class="s1">–</span>2012), Mike Wallace has struggled to consistently produce at a high level for the last three seasons. Part of his noticeable decline in production is on him (dropped passes and poor route running, for example), and the other part can be attributed playing in offensive schemes that weren’t necessarily conducive to his skill set.

In 2016, Wallace will return to playing in a system that is tailor-made for his strengths as a football player. For the last few years, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-preseason-afc-north-predictions.html/">Baltimore Ravens</a> have been searching for a legitimate downfield threat to pair with quarterback Joe Flacco, who is one of the best deep ball passers in the NFL despite all of his other shortcomings. Judging by the reports <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000686362/article/joe-flacco-mike-wallace-awesome-in-ravens-camp" target="_blank">coming out of Baltimore’s training camp</a>, it appears as though the Ravens have finally found that player in Wallace. Expect to see the 30-year-old wide receiver post the third 1,000-yard receiving season of his career in 2016.

<h2>2. Derek Carr, QB, Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_664170" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-664170" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Derek-Carr_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-3-1024x682.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="757" height="504" /> Derek Carr should put up big numbers for the Oakland Raiders in 2016 | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

While the Oakland Raiders have struggled in the win/loss column during Derek Carr’s two years in the NFL, the former Fresno State signal caller has proven that he is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-rising-stars-afc.html/">capable of consistently producing</a> above-average fantasy football numbers. In 2015, Carr threw for 3,987 yards and 32 touchdowns with 13 interceptions. With a vastly improved supporting cast, those numbers should improve in 2016.

The Raiders now <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-raiders-can-make-the-playoffs-next-year.html/">have one of the top offensive lines</a> in the league, two Pro Bowl-caliber wide receivers (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-offensive-weapons-afc-west.html/">Amari Cooper</a> and Michael Crabtree), and a tight end with game-changing potential (Clive Walford). While he will face several staunch opposing defenses throughout the year, we are still fairly confident that Carr will produce like a top-10 fantasy football quarterback in 2016.

<h2>3. Arian Foster, RB, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_574380" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-574380" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Arian-Foster-Bob-Levey-Getty-Images-1024x708.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="757" height="523" /> Arian Foster is looking to resurrect his career with the Miami Dolphins in 2016 | Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]

When Arian Foster is healthy, there is no question that he is one of the top running backs in the league. He will get a fresh start with the Dolphins in 2016, and <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/sfl-arian-foster-is-confident-he-s-all-the-way-recovered-from-achilles-injury-20160817-story.html" target="_blank">by all accounts</a>, Foster has proven throughout Miami’s training camp that he not only looks healthy, but he also looks better than ever.

The Dolphins may struggle at times on the offensive side of the ball this season, but if Foster can beat out Jay Ajayi for the team’s starting running back job, we fully expect him to produce big numbers -- especially in Adam Gase’s offensive system.

<h2>4. Sterling Shepard, WR, New York Giants</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SWfcVa_hR2s"></iframe>

As a rule, we are always skeptical of rookies when it comes to fantasy football, but Sterling Shepard could prove to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-wideouts-middle-rounds.html/">be an exception</a> to our rule. There is absolutely no denying that Odell Beckham Jr. is the No. 1 wide receiver for the Giants. Thanks to Beckham’s presence, though, Shepard should almost exclusively <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underdog-picks-offensive-rookie-year.html/">see one-on-one coverage</a> all season. In the Giants’ pass-heavy offense, that could very well result in the rookie out of Oklahoma catching 75 or more passes for well over 1,000 yards, which isn’t bad for a player who will likely be available in the later rounds of your fantasy football draft.

<h2>5. Kevin White, WR, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_533333" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-533333 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kevin-White_Bears.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="757" height="505" /> After missing his entire rookie season, Kevin White could explode in 2016 | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

The Bears used the No. 7 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft to select White, and after Kevin suffering a stress fracture in his shin, the former West Virginia star missed his entire rookie season. Now, White is completely healthy and looking to justify his draft position in 2016. Based on the <a href="http://www.profootballweekly.com/2016/08/16/hub-arkush-kevin-white-puts-on-a-show-in-bears-patriots-practice/arlsvca/" target="_blank">reports coming out of Bears camp</a>, he is well on his way to doing just that.

The Bears will likely struggle at times on offense in 2016, and they will likely spend a lot of time <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-biggest-surprise-teams-2016.html/">playing from behind</a>. To us, this means that Chicago will throw the ball a lot this season. Don’t be surprised if White goes on to post well over 1,000 yards in 2016 as a result.

<h2>6. Coby Fleener, TE, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_659477" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-659477" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Coby-Fleener-Indianapolis-Colts-1024x680.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="757" height="503" /> Coby Fleener could have a Jimmy Graham type of role in the New Orleans Saints offense | Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

Fleener has put up solid, not spectacular, numbers during his four-year NFL career, but 2016 has the potential to be a huge year for the former Stanford tight end. He left the Indianapolis Colts this offseason to sign a free agent deal with the New Orleans Saints, and based on his skill set, Fleener is a near-perfect fit for Sean Payton’s offense.

At 6-foot-6 and 250 pounds, Fleener’s strengths as a football player come in his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-fantasy-football-tight-ends-2016.html/">abilities as a pass-catcher</a>. If we have learned anything about the Saints’ offense with Drew Brees under center and Payton calling the plays, it’s that they are going to air it out. Knowing this, we are predicting a 70+ catch, 800+ yard season for Fleener in 2016.

<h2>7. Tyrod Taylor, QB, Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_682363" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-682363" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Tyrod-Taylor_Brett-Carlsen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="7 Fantasy Football Sleepers You Should Target in Your Draft" width="800" height="534" /> Tyrod Taylor's dual-threat ability makes him an intriguing fantasy football quarterback option | Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

Tyrod Taylor has a dual-threat skill set that <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underrated-quarterbacks.html/">few other NFL quarterbacks possess</a>. In fact, he often gets compared to another former Virginia Tech quarterback named Michael Vick. While Taylor is not quite Vick when it comes to running ability, he is close. Taylor is, however, a better pure passer than Vick ever was. That said, we fully expect Taylor to improve upon his 2015 numbers and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-quarterbacks-without-super-bowl.html/">emerge as a top-10 fantasy football quarterback</a> in 2016.

		<description><![CDATA[The NFL has plenty of talent at the running back position, but who are the top 20 fantasy football running backs for 2016?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're breaking down players by position as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/fantasy-football/" target="_blank">fantasy football season</a> draws near. This year, the fantasy football running backs look strong, and the top 20 group features some major studs. We already discussed the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-fantasy-football-quarterbacks-2016.html/" target="_blank">top 10 fantasy football quarterbacks</a> for the coming season, so now we move on to their backfield mates. Let's check out the top 20 backs for the upcoming season in fantasy.
<h2>20. Ryan Mathews, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_580484" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580484" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ryan-Mathews-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images-640x488.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="577" /> Ryan Mathews of the Philadelphia Eagles is tackled after making a catch by Ndamukong Suh of the Miami Dolphins. | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

We're jumping aboard the hype train. With DeMarco Murray now long gone in Tennessee, Ryan Mathews should <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-best-offensive-weapons-in-the-nfc-east.html/" target="_blank">have a strong season</a>. Quietly, he averaged five yards-per-carry in 2015, totaling 539 yards and six touchdowns.

Mathews also showed that he can be a solid pass-catcher, totaling 20 receptions for 146 yards and a score of only 28 targets. Expect him to be largely involved in Philly's game plan in 2016.
<h2>19. DeMarco Murray, Tennessee Titans</h2>
Is Murray ready to right the ship? We hope so, but we aren't completely sold, especially after the Titans <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-best-offensive-weapons-in-the-nfc-east.html/" target="_blank">drafted Derrick Henry</a>.

Murray has a great opportunity in front of him with the Titans, but we don't expect him to revert back to the player he was with the Dallas Cowboys in 2014. During that season, he rushed for 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns. Expect a top-20 season from Murray, but nothing too insane.
<h2>18. Matt Jones, Washington Redskins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_564870" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-564870" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Matt-Jones-St-Louis-Rams-v-Washington-Redskins-EdqS7o3gddQl.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Washington Redskins running back Matt Jones | Matt Hazlett/Getty Images[/caption]

With Alfred Morris now in Dallas, things have opened up for the second-year running back for the Redskins. Matt Jones rushed for 490 yards and three touchdowns last year, but his pass-catching ability is what really sells us on his top-20 ranking. He caught just 19 passes last year, but totaled 304 yards and a score. The 16-yard-per-reception total is pretty stellar.
<h2>17. Dion Lewis, New England Patriots</h2>
Before suffering a torn ACL last season, Dion Lewis was well on his way to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/predictions-new-england-patriots-2016.html/" target="_blank">having a huge year</a>. How will he recover from that injury for the Patriots? We believe Lewis will bounce back well enough to land as the No. 17 back next season.

Lewis not only rushed 49 times for 234 yards and two scores during seven games last season, but he caught an impressive 36 passes for 388 yards and two additional touchdowns. There's a lot to love about his game.
<h2>16. Eddie Lacy, Green Bay Packers</h2>
Let's face it, Eddie Lacy had a brutal 2015 season. He rushed for just 758 yards and three touchdowns, while often being overlooked for James Starks. Since the end of the year, Lacy has dropped weight and vowed to come back <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-with-the-most-to-prove.html/" target="_blank">ready to make a statement</a> in 2016.

We believe he'll bounce back, but not quite in a top-10 running back style. Instead, Lacy lands just outside of our top 15.

<h2>15. Jonathan Stewart, Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_590591" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-590591" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Jonathan-Stewart-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="Jonathan-Stewart-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" width="757" height="505" /> Carolina Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart | Streeter Lecka-Getty Images[/caption]

Jonathan Stewart's play isn't going to blow you away, but he will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underrated-running-backs.html/" target="_blank">be a consistent fantasy option</a>. Last season he rushed for 989 yards and six touchdowns over 13 games. It's obvious that Cam Newton's superstar breakthrough is helping Stewart, and it'll help once again in 2016.
<h2>14. Matt Forte, New York Jets</h2>
Matt Forte <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-players-who-will-thrive-with-their-new-teams.html/" target="_blank">landed in a new city</a>, which we believe means that he'll be a rejuvenated runner. Forte had the worst season of his career in 2015, rushing for just 898 yards and four touchdowns, while seeing a major dip in receptions (just 44 for 389 yards and three additional scores).

The fact is that the Jets will utilize Forte in any and every way possible. Expect to see him get far more touches than he did in 2015 with the Chicago Bears.
<h2>13. Carlos Hyde, San Francisco 49ers</h2>
In his second NFL season, Carlos Hyde hit the ground running in Week 1 against the Minnesota Vikings. In that game, he rushed 26 times for 168 yards and two touchdowns.

Unfortunately, he couldn't stay even remotely healthy from that point on, and wound up playing in just seven games throughout all of the 2015 season. With Hyde healthy in 2016, he will be a huge contributor and focal point of San Francisco's offense.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>12. Thomas Rawls, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639301" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639301" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thomas-Rawls_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

During his rookie season, Thomas Rawls' number was called when Marshawn Lynch was injured, and he stepped up in a big way. Now, Lynch is riding into the sunset in retirement, which means that it's Rawls' time to shine.

His impressive 830 yards and four touchdowns over just seven starts last year stands out, so the question is what can he do with a full 16 games? We believe it'll be fun to watch, while ranking him just outside of the fantasy top 10.
<h2>11. LeSean McCoy, Buffalo Bills</h2>
LeSean McCoy's been impressive for a long time now, but his first season in Buffalo was filled with injuries and a few mediocre games. Fortunately, McCoy bounced back nicely when all was said and done, averaging 4.4 yards-per-carry, with 895 yards and three rushing touchdowns in 12 games.

His skill as a pass catcher can't be overlooked either, as he caught 32 passes last year for 292 yards and two additional scores.
<h2>10. Jamaal Charles, Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
Jamaal Charles just can't seem to catch a break when it comes to injuries. He'll be rolling right along, then suffer a setback. Last season Charles was only able to play in five games before tearing his ACL -- but he was superb during those five games.

Charles rushed 71 times for 364 yards (5.1 yards-per-carry) with four touchdowns. He's a great receiving threat out of the backfield as well, and we know Alex Smith loves to utilize him however possible. Expect a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-bounce-back-injury-2016.html/" target="_blank">nice bounce back for Charles</a> in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9. Mark Ingram, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_563876" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-563876 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Mark-Ingram_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="613" /> New Orleans Saints running back Mark Ingram | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Another player who was hit with the injury bug. If Mark Ingram was able to stay healthy in 2015, we'd likely be looking at a Pro Bowl season. He totaled 769 rushing yards, 405 receiving yards, and six touchdowns through the first 12 games of the season.

Ingram showed in a big way last season that he can be a threat in the passing game, which helps take his fantasy value to a top-10 level.
<h2>8. Doug Martin, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
While we don't expect Doug Martin to be right on the fringe of taking down the NFL rushing crown again in 2016, we do think he'll have a strong year. Martin proved that he could still be an elite running back last season, rushing for 1,454 yards and 11 touchdowns, while also catching 49 passes for 472 yards and an additional score. If he can come anywhere close to those numbers again in 2016, fantasy owners will be completely thrilled.
<h2>7. Lamar Miller, Houston Texans</h2>
To be honest, last season was essentially irrelevant for Lamar Miller, so we aren't even going to talk about it. He's in a new town with a new team, and he's going to be hungry.

The Miami Dolphins didn't get the ball into Miller's hands as much as they should have, but the Texans will be more than happy to give the ball to the man they just signed for $26 million over four years.

Miller can get it done both on the ground and through the air, making him a focal point of this offense as well as a player who will ease the pressure off DeAndre Hopkins in the passing game.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Devonta Freeman, Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_651454" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-651454" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Devonta-Freeman_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1-640x446.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="528" /> Atlanta Falcons running back Devonta Freeman | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Devonta Freeman had a massive breakout year for fantasy owners in 2015, going off for 1,634 combined rushing and receiving yards, while catching 73 passes, and scoring 14 touchdowns. It doesn't get much better than that for fantasy owners, and at the very least, we expect to see Freeman as a huge part of the passing game. In 2016, he'll be a featured back once again.
<h2>5. Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
Running behind the best offensive line in the NFL, the No. 4 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-6-rookies-with-the-most-fantasy-potential-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">selected for a reason</a>. We're going to guess that the reason wasn't to sit behind either Darren McFadden or Morris.

Ezekiel Elliott will be asked to do a ton in 2016, including running, catching passes, blocking, and possibly even more. Don't expect Dallas to hold back in what may be one of the final years for <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underrated-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">Tony Romo</a> to really help the team push for a Super Bowl.
<h2>4. Todd Gurley, Los Angeles Rams</h2>
Sophomore slump? We're not buying it. Todd Gurley played in only 13 games last season, but still topped 1,100 rushing yards with 10 touchdowns. Expect him to be the entire focus on Los Angeles' offense in 2016, and for it to pay off in a big way.

The reason why he's not higher on our list is simply due to his lack of receptions, but it's worth noting that he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-underrated-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">may see even more</a> of those this coming season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. David Johnson, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639299" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639299" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/David-Johnson_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1-518x500.jpg" alt="NFL: Top 20 Fantasy Football Running Backs for 2016" width="757" height="730" /> Running back David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

It took multiple injuries, but a star was born in Arizona last season. David Johnson was an absolute force last year even though he only started five games. Overall, he had 581 rushing yards, a 4.6-yard-per-carry average, 457 receiving yards, and 12 combined touchdowns.

Don't be shocked if Johnson is able to wind up even higher on this list than No. 3, but we see the third spot as his floor this year.
<h2>2. Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
Adrian Peterson just <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/adrian-peterson-career-stats.html/" target="_blank">isn't a normal NFL running back</a>. Usually, backs will slow down around the age of 30. For Peterson, he took it back up a notch.

In 2015, he not only led the NFL in rushing yards with 1,485, but also scored 11 touchdowns, while catching 30 passes for 222 yards. The Vikings will once again feed the rock to their elite running back, so don't expect a slowdown.
<h2>1. Le'Veon Bell, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
Le'Veon Bell is by far the most well-rounded running back in the NFL. Even with the fact that his Week 1 status is unknown, we can't leave him off this spot.

A knee injury and two-game suspension sidelined him for all but six games of 2015, but during those six games, he averaged 4.9-yards-per-carry, rushed for 556 yards, caught 24 passes for 136 yards, and scored three touchdowns.

Expect the Steelers to center their offense around him and Antonio Brown. His pass-catching ability is what gives him the nod at No. 1 on this list in 2016.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_581511" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-581511" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ezekiel-Elliott-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Ezekiel Elliott" width="757" height="505" /> Ezekiel Elliott faces off against Michigan State prior to his career in the NFL. | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

As the 2016 NFL season draws closer, fantasy football drafts are beginning to heat up. Obviously, you must prepare for your draft, and we're going to help with that by checking out some of the biggest names in fantasy football and predicting their outcomes.

While we've talked about a few big-name running backs out there, including <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-adrian-peterson.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Adrian Peterson</a> and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-projections-todd-gurley.html/" target="_blank">Todd Gurley</a>, we now shift our attention to one of the most intriguing rookie running backs in recent memory. That would be none other than the Dallas Cowboys' No. 4 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Ezekiel Elliott.

While Elliott enters the league with a set of skills we haven't seen from a rookie running back in a long time, many fantasy football owners wonder whether or not he will immediately step in and be the featured workhorse back for the Cowboys? The answer: You bet.

Elliott is not only a superb runner, but he is also a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-predicting-the-most-productive-rookie-rbs-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">great pass-catcher</a> and strong blocker. He'll be able to do the best job out of himself, Darren McFadden, and Alfred Morris when it comes to protecting Tony Romo. So, let's take a look at how this will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-6-rookies-with-the-most-fantasy-potential-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">impact his fantasy value</a> and what we expect from him in 2016.

Remember back in 2014 when the Cowboys handed the ball to DeMarco Murray 392 times? That number seems absolutely unreal, but it's also what led to the Cowboys have incredible success that season. The team went 12-4 and beat the Detroit Lions in the postseason, before dropping the divisional round to the Green Bay Packers on a brutal non-catch call (that everyone remembers).

What is slightly overlooked is the fact that Murray also caught 57 passes that year, so his usage was just unreal. While we know the type of workload that Murray handled in 2014, how about the 2015 running backs?

The Cowboys released Joseph Randle during the season, so McFadden didn't even get big carries until around the sixth game of the season. Even with that said, he still totaled 239 attempts, while Randle saw 76 rushes, Robert Turbin received 32, Christine Michael got 15, and Lance Dunbar (who got injured) saw five carries. In total, there were 367 rushes carried out. Not too crazy, right? At least, not like 2014.

What can't be overlooked: This team was basically behind in every single game that Romo didn't play. There weren't nearly as many rushing attempts last season as the Cowboys would have liked, which was simply due to the fact that the team was 4-12 and couldn't hold a lead to save their lives. In turn, we should fully expect Dallas to get back to what they did in 2014 -- with a huge number of carries for Elliott.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Pass-catching will place him in the "elite" category</h2>
[caption id="attachment_546670" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-546670 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ezekiel-Elliott-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images-e1436376248831.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Ezekiel Elliott" width="757" height="505" /> Former Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott, now with the Dallas Cowboys | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

While we know Elliott can run (he had 3,961 rushing yards, 43 touchdowns, and a 6.7 yard-per-carry average over three years at Ohio State), the man can also catch passes. He actually wasn't asked to do a ton of it during his time with the Buckeyes, but in his final two seasons with the team, he caught 55 passes for 426 yards.

Elliott will be likely see somewhere between 30-40 receptions with the Cowboys in 2016, especially if he emerges as a player who the Cowboys simply can't afford to take off the field (which seems likely). Tacking those receptions onto a possibly huge workload running the ball, and there's almost no question that we're looking at a top-five fantasy football running back in 2016. Here's how we see the top five ranking when all is said and done:
<ol>
 	<li>Le’Veon Bell</li>
 	<li>Adrian Peterson</li>
 	<li>David Johnson</li>
 	<li>Todd Gurley</li>
 	<li>Ezekiel Elliott</li>
</ol>
Aside from Peterson, that's a lot of young talent on the board. Expect Elliott to hit the ground running, quickly proving that he was worth the exceptionally high draft pick the Cowboys spent on him.

		<description><![CDATA[For 2016–17, the 5 best NFL defenses are stacked with versatile players who can either stop the run, drop back into coverage, or blitz from any angle.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[To many, the NFL <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/best-nfl-offenses-2016-17.html/">is now a passing league</a>, with the likes of Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-tom-brady-life-much-better-players.html/">Tom Brady</a> taking turns shattering long-held records dating back decades. In recent years, league executives have levied stiff fines, penalties, and suspensions against overly aggressive defenders who take cheap shots against prone quarterbacks and receivers. As a result, offensive coordinators now regularly roll out multiple receiver sets, and dare defenses to adjust.

Offense may sell tickets, but defense wins games. In recent years, Seattle, Baltimore, and the New York Giants have each rode dominant defenses to Super Bowl glory. Last year, in Super Bowl 50, Von Miller and the Bronco defense took away MVP honors, while the aging Peyton Manning was tasked with simply managing the game and limiting his mistakes. For 2016–17, the five best NFL defenses will be stacked with versatile players at every level, who can either stop the run, drop back into coverage, or blitz from any angle to tee off upon the quarterback.
<h2><strong>5. Cincinnati Bengals</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_681401" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-681401" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Cincinnati-Bengals_Joe-Robbins_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Defenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="504" /> Vontaze Burfict of the Cincinnati Bengals reacts to a play | Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

Long gone are the days of the Cincinnati Bungles, when this franchise was mostly associated with perpetual losing, draft busts, extensive rap sheets, and shamed fans wearing brown paper bags at Riverfront. Cincinnati has actually made the playoffs through five consecutive seasons and has replaced Baltimore as Pittsburgh’s main rival out of the brutal AFC North. In recent years, smart draft picks, pinpoint passing from Andy Dalton, and aggressive defensive schemes out of Marvin Lewis brought forth a complete change in culture in Cincinnati.

Last season, the Bengals defense ranked second, in terms of points allowed, while being especially good at stopping the run and forcing turnovers. Carlos Dunlap and Geno Atkins owned the line of scrimmage, combining for 24.5 sacks through the 2015–16 regular season. At the second level, Vontaze Burfict and Rey Maualuga were free to wreak havoc, as athletic linebackers who can cover ground quickly from sideline-to-sideline. For 2016–17, George Iloka appears ready to slide over and replace the recently departed Reggie Nelson at free safety. Nelson did lead the NFL in interceptions last season, with eight. Talent is not the issue in Cincinnati.

It is the mental breakdowns and boneheaded mistakes that have kept the Bengals right outside of joining the ranks of the elite, in this ultimate game of inches. Marvin Lewis is 0-7 in the postseason, and Pittsburgh tackle Marcus Gilbert went so far as to demand a meeting with Cincinnati in the 2015–16 playoffs, “<a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000601341/article/steelers-ot-wants-to-face-choking-bengals-in-playoffs">where they choke</a>.” Gilbert got his wish, with Pittsburgh setting up for the game-winning field goal in Cincinnati. Multiple personal fouls, cheap shots, fights, suspensions, and roughly $85,000 in fines ultimately marred this wild-card bloodbath.

<h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_536014" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-536014" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Patrick-Peterson-640x448.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Defenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="530" /> Patrick Peterson celebrates his talented defense | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Arizona Cardinal defensive backs are rapidly emerging as the best secondary unit in the league this side of Seattle. Patrick Peterson is a shutdown corner who shadows the other team’s best receiver across the entire field and is rarely challenged. Last season, in Week 6, he took Antonio Brown out of his game and held him to three catches for 24 yards. Peterson, at 220 pounds, is a physical corner who excels in press coverage, without the benefit of safety help over the top.

At free safety, Tyrann Mathieu is a complete football player who can cheat up to the line of scrimmage for run support, go man-to-man against the slot, and also drop back into deep-zone coverage as the ultimate centerfielder. To mix things up, Mathieu will sometimes blitz off the edge and tee off upon the quarterback. The Honey Badger simply has a nose for the football; he racked up 80 tackles last season, second on the team. Peterson and Mathieu are two of the better playmakers, at any position, in the NFL. Taken together, the two former LSU teammates have combined for 25 interceptions and six return touchdowns in the NFL.

Last March, Arizona shipped out right guard Jonathan Cooper and their 2016 second-round pick to New England in exchange for Chandler Jones. Jones picked up 12.5 sacks last season and will immediately fill the glaring need for a hybrid linebacker/defensive end edge rusher within the Cardinal scheme. For 2015–16, Dwight Freeney, at 35, actually led the team in sacks, with eight. The Arizona defense is set to improve further upon a year when it ranked fifth in terms of yards allowed, with Chandler Jones now in the fold to wreak havoc and collapse the pocket.

<h2><strong>3. Denver Broncos</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_548204" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-548204 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Von-Miller_DeMarcus-Ware_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Defenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="529" /> Von Miller (L) and DeMarcus Ware solidify their defensive bond | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The 2015–16 Denver Broncos were often compared directly to the 2000 Baltimore Ravens; both had a Super Bowl run thanks to a historically dominant defense that carried a game-managing quarterback to the Promised Land. Last season, a brittle Manning gave up 17 picks against only nine touchdowns through nine regular-season games. Brock Osweiler leased the quarterback position through the backstretch of the season, before giving way back to Manning right before the playoffs started. In retrospect, the 2015–16 Bronco defense could have even carried the likes of Trent Dilfer to the Big Game, after finishing the season a respective third and first in run and pass defense.

For Denver, the action began with pressure, with both Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware flying off the edge to take their shots at the quarterback. Meanwhile, cornerbacks Chris Harris and Aqib Talib would lay in wait to pounce upon any mistakes and take interceptions back to the house. The formula was on full display for Super Bowl 50, when Von Miller came up with the MVP and 2.5 sacks. Cam Newton, for his part, refused to even address the media, after going a miserable 18-for-41 and taking seven sacks.

Like clockwork, the competition showed up to raid players immediately after the Super Bowl victory parade. The Broncos did lose defensive end Malik Jackson to the Jacksonville Jaguars and leading tackler Danny Trevathan to the Chicago Bears in free agency. In their place, Todd Davis and Vance Walker will step up as starters, with the Bronco D not missing much of a beat. If anything, it will likely be shaky quarterback play and poor field position that repeatedly force the defense to come up with important stops at Mile High.

<h2><strong>2. Seattle Seahawks</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_567864" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-567864" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Richard-Sherman-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Defenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="528" /> Richard Sherman intercepts a pass against the San Francisco 49ers | Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

The Seahawks have quickly emerged as one of the more polarizing teams in all of sports, largely due to their obnoxiously loud 12th Man fan base, rah-rah head coach, and brazen trash talk. Against this backdrop, the "haters" take special pleasure in calling for the inevitable decline of this team and Legion of Boom secondary. Seattle has played its part, in becoming synonymous with slow starts, before somehow rounding into form and blowing the doors off the competition through the playoffs.

Last year, the Seahawks actually dropped to 2-4, before taking eight of their next 10 to close out the regular season at 10-6. The Hawks opened up the season by giving up 34 points -- to the likes of Nick Foles and the Rams in St. Louis. By season's end, however, Seattle came all the way back to limit the high-octane Arizona Cardinals to six points on the road. For the year, the Seahawk D ranked a respective first and second in scoring and yards allowed.

The Legion of Boom secondary features three perennial Pro Bowlers in their prime, in the rangy Earl Thomas, hard-hitting Kam Chancellor, and brash Richard Sherman. Pete Carroll, with the L.O.B. patrolling the back half of the field, is now free to constantly rotate a fresh batch of players into the front seven. Carroll blitzes rarely, instead relying upon smaller defensive ends, like Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril to beat tackles off the ball and apply pressure. Carroll has been running this same base defense since his time at USC and the opposition has yet to crack its code. Expect more of the same this season, as Seattle reloads, yet again, with Jordan Hill and Mike Morgan to replace Brandon Mebane and Bruce Irvin in the starting lineup.

<h2><strong>1. Houston Texans</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_587402" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-587402" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/JJ-Watt_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images1-640x403-640x403.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Defenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="477" /> J.J. Watt prepares before a game | Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]

The Houston Texans defense has remained very much underrated, with the franchise cycling through the likes of Brian Hoyer, Ryan Mallett, T.J. Yates, and even Brandon Weeden at quarterback. Last year, Houston ranked 29th in field position, largely due to its sputtering offense with no continuity at quarterback. Still, the team ranked seventh in scoring defense, despite already being backed up against a wall when taking the field. The 2015–16 Texans defense did rank first, in terms of forcing three-and-outs, and limiting average drives to 5.1 plays.

The Texans defense, of course, begins with J.J. Watt, who is a one-man wrecking crew, in the mold of Lawrence Taylor. For 2015, Watt came up 17.5 sacks, 57 solo tackles, and three forced fumbles. Outside linebacker Whitney Mercilus broke out last year to tally up 12 sacks in his own right, with offensive coordinators keying in on Watt. For 2016, the Texans plan to finally welcome back a healthy Jadeveon Clowney onto the field. Houston will have the best pass rush in all of football, if it were to get <em>anything</em> out of former first overall pick Clowney this season. The explosive up-front pass rush will make life relatively easy for corners Kareem Jackson and Johnathan Joseph. The Texans will also be stout against the run, with Vince Wilfork eating up space at the point of attack, so that Brian Cushing can fill the gaps and take out the trash.

The Texans did roll the dice and make a big-time move this offseason, signing Osweiler to a four-year, $72 million contract. Certainly, Osweiler gained valuable experience last year, in going 5-2 as the starter, managing the game and riding a ferocious defense in Denver. For this year, the Houston defense will look even better, with Brock Osweiler limiting turnovers, making smart throws to move the chains, and chewing up clock. Houston will be the team to beat out of the AFC South.

		<description><![CDATA[The NFL is now a passing league. For 2016–17, the best NFL offenses will all feature strong quarterback play, which will set up the run.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[NFL analysts are quick to throw out the old "<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/fantasy-football-defenses-top-teams.html/">defense wins games</a>" cliche. Casual fans and league executives, however, would generally agree that it is actually offense that sells tickets. In recent years, the NFL has cracked down hard upon physical play against the quarterback and receivers running patterns out in space. Offensive coordinators now regularly roll out three- and four-wide receiver sets to take advantage of these new rules changes.

In 2011, Drew Brees went over the top to pass for 5,476 yards and break Dan Marino’s single-season passing yards (5,084) record that stood for 27 years. Two years later, Peyton Manning one-upped Brees with 5,477 yards passing in his own right. To state the obvious, the NFL is now a passing league. For 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17, the best NFL offenses will all <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-quarterbacks-who-will-have-the-best-2016-seasons.html/">feature strong quarterback play</a>, which will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-top-running-teams-2016.html/">set up the run</a>. Football purists from the "three yards and a cloud of dust" era are likely turning over in their graves.
<h2><strong>5. Arizona Cardinals</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_598929" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598929" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/David-Johnson-Norm-Hall-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Offenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="505" /> David Johnson takes one for the team | Norm Hall/Getty Images[/caption]

Both the Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys seemed set to emerge as some of the best NFL offenses, contingent upon health. The Cowboys went out and took Ezekiel Elliott out of Ohio State with the fourth overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft -- a major consolation prize for last year’s disastrous season. At the time, Elliott was the frontrunner for Offensive Rookie of the Year; he would run behind perennial Pro Bowlers up front, Tyron Smith, Travis Frederick, and Zack Martin.

Last weekend, however, Tony Romo was caught from behind while attempting to slide out of the pocket in a meaningless preseason game in Seattle. The hit fractured vertebrae in Romo’s back, and he will be out for another six to 10 weeks. Rookie Dak Prescott, a fourth-round pick, will be thrown into the fray and tasked with commanding respect out of the likes of Dez Bryant and Jason Witten in the huddle. Dallas went 1-11 last season without Romo. Meanwhile, Arizona has turned back the clock in the Valley of the Sun, with Chris Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, and Carson Palmer all supposedly on the wrong side of 30.

Earlier in his career, it was Palmer who suffered from a series of devastating injuries, including two torn ACLs. Last year, he came back at 36 years old, to play the best football of his life, in completing 64% of his passes for 4,671 yards and 35 touchdowns. Johnson and Fitzgerald also returned to prime form, combining for 2,087 yards and 12 touchdowns of total offense. The Cards do have great depth on the offensive side of the football -- to allay injury and age-related concerns. Drew Stanton is one of the better backup quarterbacks in the league and can step in to win games down the stretch. At the skill positions, David Johnson, John Brown, and Michael Floyd are all young players capable of going over 1,000 yards when featured. Arizona will make another deep postseason run, if this high-octane offense can put points on the board against division rival Seattle.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>New England Patriots</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_594708" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594708" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images-640x445-640x445.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Offenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="526" /> Tom Brady points at the opposing defense | Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Tom Brady will serve out his four-game Deflategate suspension to start the season. In his place, Jimmy Garoppolo is tasked with managing the game and riding a stingy defense against the Cardinals, Dolphins, Texans, and Bills. Against this lineup, the Patriots may stand at 2-2, before Tom Brady even takes the field. Brady, at quarterback, is the NFL’s leading man, with 58,028 total yards, 428 touchdowns, and, most importantly, four Super Bowl rings. Last season, Tom Brady, at 38 years old, led the NFL in touchdowns passes with 36. In typical Patriots fashion, the team finished third in scoring offense, without the benefit of any real burners on the outside.

Only Rob Gronkowski went over 1,000 receiving yards for the year, while wideouts Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Brandon LaFell each caught more than 70 balls for over 500 yards. Gronk, of course, is a matchup nightmare. He is all but automatic in the red zone. The Patriots, remember, were one failed two-point conversion at Mile High Stadium away from Super Bowl 50. Brady, like his arch-rival Manning, may have one last Super Bowl run left in him before delivering his Hall of Fame speech. For support, the Pats will go running-back-by-committee, with LeGarrette Blount, Brandon Bolden, and Dion Lewis sharing the load. Like clockwork, the Patriots offense will round into form by midseason, en route to clinching yet another AFC East title.
<h2><!--nextpage--> <strong>3. Green Bay Packers</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_539273" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-539273 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Green-Bay-Packers.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Offenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="505" /> The Green Bay Packers prepare for battle | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Last season, Aaron Rodgers completed 61% of his passes for 3,821 yards and 31 touchdowns against only eight interceptions. Behind Rodgers, the Pack ripped off six straight wins to open the season, before taking their first loss to the Denver Broncos on the road. In Week 3, Rodgers lit up the Kansas City Chiefs for 325 yards and one touchdown in a 38-28 win. The Pack closed out the regular season at 10-6, before losing an overtime thriller to Arizona in the Divisional Playoffs. For Rodgers, 2015 was actually a down year, in that he put up the worst numbers of his career as the full-time starter. The Green Bay offense then ranked 15th in points scored.

Rodgers, even in a down season, is clearly one of the best quarterbacks in the game. Much of the dropoff in production was due to the fact that Jordy Nelson blew out his knee that preseason and was shut down for the year. Nelson, in 2014, hauled in 98 receptions for 1,519 yards and 13 touchdowns. For 2016<span class="s1">–</span>17, he is back to stretch the field as one of the better big-play threats in the NFL. The ever dangerous Randall Cobb will then be free to work underneath routes out of the slot, with Nelson occupying both safeties deep over the top.

At the same time, Eddie Lacy has dropped weight, and seems poised to regain the form and burst that had him rack up 2,317 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground through his first two years in the league. Expect the Packers to emerge as legitimate <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/legitimate-super-bowl-contenders.html/">Super Bowl LI contenders</a> by midseason, behind their high-octane attack and bend-but-don’t-break defense. For the opposition, no lead is safe, with Rodgers at the controls and in full command of the offense.

<strong>2. Carolina Panthers</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_598981" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-598981" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cam-Newton_Grant-Halverson_Getty-Images-640x432.jpg" alt="The 5 Best NFL Offenses for 2016–17" width="757" height="511" /> Cam Newton leads his offense to victory | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

Carolina will surprise no one this season. Last year, the Panthers ripped off 14 consecutive wins, en route to 15-1 and a trip to the Super Bowl. Carolina established themselves as the team to beat, in outlasting a 37-29 Week 9 shootout at home against the Green Bay Packers. For the year, the 2015 Panthers ranked first in scoring offense and 11th in total yardage. Like Green Bay, the Panthers will also get a primary target (Kelvin Benjamin) back this season, after he tore his ACL during preseason team drills and was out for the entirety of 2015. Benjamin, as a rookie in 2014, hauled in 73 receptions for 1,008 yards and nine touchdowns.

Kelvin Benjamin, at 6-foot-5, is an imposing target who works well alongside speedster Ted Ginn Jr. on the outside. For added measure, Greg Olsen in one of the better pass-catching tight ends in the game and has gone over 1,000 yards receiving through two consecutive seasons. The Panthers will do much of their damage on the ground, with Jonathan Stewart carrying the load. To mix things up, the coaching staff will also call designed runs and option reads, to get Cam Newton out in space. This group will be all but unstoppable at the goal-line, with Newton going play-action, tucking the ball down and in, and racing towards the pylon. After baiting the defense to close down and commit, Newton may hit Greg Olsen dragging across the back of the end zone for six.

Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

The Pittsburgh offense will fire on all cylinders by mid-season, after Le’Veon Bell serves out his three-game suspension. Bell, of course, has quickly emerged as one of the more versatile weapons in all of football, after racking up 2,215 yards and 11 touchdowns worth of total offense through 2014. As the featured back, he is one cut and go at the line of scrimmage, before he drops his pads to break tackles and explode into the secondary. For passing situations, Bell is especially dangerous out of the screen game, and can even work effectively out of the slot.

Antonio Brown, the former sixth-round draft pick out of Central Michigan, is now often cited as the best wide receiver in the game. Brown has led the NFL in receptions through two consecutive seasons, with 129 in 2014 and 136 in 2015. As the total package, he is especially good at running routes, exploiting holes in zone coverage, and catching the football in traffic. After the catch, the shifty Brown often makes multiple defenders miss; he is a threat to score any time that he takes the field, even putting in double duty as a return man.

To mix things up, expect the Steelers to build out a Wildcat package, with Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell shifting across the formation. Ben Roethlisberger, of course, will be the straw that stirs the drink for this potent offense. For years, he has remained somewhat behind Brady, Manning, and even Rodgers within the QB pecking order, while also laying claim to two Super Bowl rings in his own right. In 2014, Roethlisberger did complete 67% of his passes and torched the NFL for a league leading 4,952 yards.

For 2015, Roethlisberger battled a series of nagging injuries and missed five starts, but he did lead the NFL in yards per game (328). Big Ben is at his best on broken plays, when he can muscle his way out of a collapsing pocket, pirouette away from the action, gather his feet, and throw a strike right down the middle of the field. As a sign of the times, Roethlisberger and his explosive offense will carry the day in Pittsburgh. The ghosts of the Steel Curtain past will watch on from Three Rivers.

		<description><![CDATA[The AFC North has two frontrunners in 2016, but who will take the division crown when all is said and done? These are our preseason AFC North predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, the Cincinnati Bengals took the crown in the AFC North, even with quarterback Andy Dalton missing three games. The Bengals went 12-4 on the season, but unfortunately lost a brutal game to the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/pittsburgh-steelers-win-super-bowl.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">rival Pittsburgh Steelers</a> in the playoffs, 18-16. Aside from the Bengals and Steelers, the 2015 season was a brutal one for the other two teams in the division, as the Baltimore Ravens finished 5-11 and the Cleveland Browns went 3-13.

The question is, can either of those teams make up some ground and get back into the mix with the Steelers and Bengals in 2016? Let's break down the division as a whole, and get into the preseason AFC North predictions, where we believe the Red Rocket and his Bengals will get the job done once again -- but just barely. Here's how we think the teams will rank at season's end:
<ol>
 	<li>Cincinnati Bengals</li>
 	<li>Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
 	<li>Baltimore Ravens</li>
 	<li>Cleveland Browns</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_584509" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-584509" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cincinnati-Bengals_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images-640x481.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC North Predictions" width="757" height="569" /> Andy Dalton (R) of the Cincinnati Bengals congratulates Tyler Eifert of the Cincinnati Bengals after scoring a touchdown. | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

The good news? The Cincinnati Bengals have made the playoffs in five straight seasons (six of the last seven). The bad news? They've lost in the wild card round every single year. We're on board with the Bengals finally breaking that streak in 2016, assuming they can stay healthy. Holding off the Steelers won't be an easy task, but this is a team coming off their best regular season since 1988.

The Bengals' offensive talent is on another level, and their defense allowed the second-fewest points-per-game in 2015, at 17.4. Teams will have trouble scoring on Cincinnati, and that offense will keep on rolling, led by Dalton, A.J. Green, Tyler Eifert, and two intriguing running backs in Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_593599" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-593599" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Antonio-Brown-Justin-Aller-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC North Predictions" width="757" height="505" /> Antonio Brown celebrates a touchdown. | Justin Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

The Steelers will once again make the playoffs, but they'll finish right on the heels of the Bengals in the AFC North. This is a team that literally hasn't fallen below the .500 mark a single time since Ben Roethlisberger took over at quarterback in 2004. They've hit the 8-8 mark three times, but aside from that, have finished with winning records in each season.

Roethlisberger is just a pure winner, and he has one of the best wide receivers in the entire NFL in Antonio Brown. Tack on a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-leveon-bell.html/" target="_blank">supremely talented running back</a> in Le'Veon Bell, and it's easy to see why the Steelers are <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-with-the-most-favorable-schedules-next-season.html/" target="_blank">such a dangerous group</a>. While their defense does have a few question marks, they're still more than talented enough to push the Bengals, make the playoffs, and of course, potentially <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-go-undefeated-next-season.html/" target="_blank">make another Super Bowl run</a>.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Baltimore Ravens</h2>
[caption id="attachment_561565" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-561565" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Steve-Smith-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC North Predictions" width="757" height="504" /> Steve Smith of the Baltimore Ravens reacts to a play. | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

Was the 2015 season just a fluke year for the Ravens, or is it a sign that the tides may turn in the wrong direction for this team? After seven straight seasons of finishing .500 or better, while making the playoffs six times, the Ravens dropped to 5-11, and their defense struggled mightily; they allowed 25.1 points-per-game last season. Joe Flacco had a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/overrated-nfl-players.html/" target="_blank">pretty rough year</a> as well, throwing for just 2,791 yards in 10 games due to injuries, while tossing 14 touchdowns against 12 interceptions.

The injuries to both Flacco and veteran wide receiver Steve Smith obviously <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-liability-players.html/" target="_blank">played a part</a>, but will this healthy duo be enough to overcome defensive shortcomings? Baltimore needs to get things turned around, but the issue is that both the Bengals and Steelers look like the AFC North's dominant forces. It's feeling like <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/no-faith-nfl-teams.html/" target="_blank">another third-place finish</a> for the Ravens in 2016.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_618041" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-618041" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Robert-Griffin-III_Cleveland-Browns_Redskins-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason AFC North Predictions" width="757" height="504" /> Quarterback Robert Griffin III of the Cleveland Browns | Matt Hazlett/ Getty Images[/caption]

Sorry, Cleveland fans. While the Johnny Manziel drama may be over, and the team is at least pointed in the right direction in some areas, the amazing turnaround won't happen in 2016. Robert Griffin III may be able to show he's still capable of <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">being an NFL-caliber quarterback</a>. We'll even go as far as saying that the Browns can win more than three games next season. Unfortunately, we won't <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-we-expect-to-see-fail-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">go much further than that</a>.

The playoff drought that dates back to the 2003 season will continue. Their defense allowed 27 points-per-game last season, while the offense averaged just a measly 17.4 points-per-game as well, which ranked them as the third-worst overall offensively and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-with-trouble-on-defense.html/" target="_blank">eighth-worst overall defensively</a>. It's a brutal spot, but at the very least, the Browns have some young talent who may help this team turn things around eventually.

		<description><![CDATA[Now that NFL training camps are well in session, here is a look at our current power rankings as the offseason nears its end.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rest easy, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> fans. The 2016 football season is rapidly approaching. The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-picks-by-state.html/" target="_blank">2016 NFL Draft came and went</a>, and training camp is in session. Aside from a few roster moves <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-expect-to-see-these-5-big-name-players-get-cut-this-offseason.html/" target="_blank">involving veteran players</a> who we will inevitably see before and during training camp, every team's roster for the upcoming season is set.

With that being the case, we put together our post-draft power rankings, which reflect every team's offseason moves. Here's what we came up with.
<h2>32. Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621777" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621777" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Cleveland-Browns-Fans_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-640x423.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="500" /> The Cleveland Browns have one of the longest suffering fanbases in professional sports. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The reality of the situation in Cleveland is that the Browns have holes all over their roster -- despite having 14 picks in the 2016 NFL Draft -- and they are still a long ways away from being competitive in the AFC North. Expect to see things get worse before they get better for the Browns in 2016.
<h2>31. San Francisco 49ers</h2>
When you truly think about it, it's shocking how far the 49ers fell over the last two seasons. In case you've missed it, they went from being one of the premier franchises in the league with one of the best head coaches in the business (Jim Harbaugh) on their sidelines to being arguably the worst team in the NFL with one of the most controversial coaches (Chip Kelly) in the game running the show. Needless to say, it will be several years before we see the Niners competing for another Super Bowl title.
<h2>30. San Diego Chargers</h2>
The Chargers have a legitimate franchise quarterback in Philip Rivers, but beyond that, there isn't much to write about. This team is officially in rebuild mode.
<h2>29. Tennessee Titans</h2>
The Titans have done well for themselves in the past two drafts, but still aren't quite ready to contend in the AFC South. On the bright side, the addition of offensive tackle Jack Conklin should help them keep second-year quarterback Marcus Mariota upright, and on top of that, the team is armed with loads of draft picks next year.
<h2>28. Detroit Lions</h2>
Losing a future Hall of Famer in Calvin Johnson to retirement obviously stings, but that is far from the Lions' only issue going forward. Quarterback Matthew Stafford's career is at a proverbial crossroads, their offensive line play left something to be desired in 2015, and their defense took a major step backward last year. This team is capable of surprising some people, but we just don't see it happening.
<h2>27. Chicago Bears</h2>
The Bears are a popular pick among NFL experts to turn things around in 2016, but we just don't see it. Their defense is still ill-equipped to stop a playoff-caliber offense, and it's hard to expect a step back from quarterback Jay Cutler now that Adam Gase is the head coach of the Miami Dolphins. To make matters worse, the Bears have to deal with two of the better teams in the NFC -- the Green Bay Packers and the Minnesota Vikings -- within their division.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>26. New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_565106" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-565106" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sean-Payton-Drew-Brees_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Can Sean Payton and Drew Brees lead the New Orleans Saints back to the NFC Playoffs? | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Based on what we saw last year, future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees is inching closer and closer to being just another veteran playing on borrowed time, and their defense was laughably bad. The Saints should be better on the defensive side of the ball (which isn't really saying much), but it's still hard for us to consider them true playoff contenders in the NFC.
<h2>25. Miami Dolphins</h2>
There is no arguing that the Dolphins have a fair amount of talent. If they ever truly gel, there is a good chance that this could be a playoff team in 2016. With that being said, we just don't see them ending their seven-year postseason drought in 2016.
<h2>24. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
By all accounts, the Eagles are committed to giving their first-round draft pick, quarterback Carson Wentz, a redshirt season in 2016. The fact that they aren't going to rush his development leads us to believe that the folks in Philadelphia are building for the future. That said, the NFC East is wide open, and the Eagles are talented enough to make a surprise run if things go well for them this season.
<h2>23. Baltimore Ravens</h2>
The Ravens had a disastrous season in 2015, and we just don't see things getting much better in 2016. Even with his outstanding play during the 2012 season, we aren't sold on Joe Flacco being a legitimate franchise quarterback. We also have serious concerns about the Ravens' rapidly aging defense. We don't doubt that Ozzie Newsome, who is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/ranking-the-5-best-general-managers-in-the-nfl.html/" target="_blank">one of the best General Managers in the league</a>, will turn things around in Baltimore, but it won't happen in 2016.
<h2>22. Buffalo Bills</h2>
The Bills have talent all over the field, but will they gel, stay healthy, and put together a complete season in 2016? Only time will tell, but our initial suspicion is that their postseason drought will continue.
<h2>21. Atlanta Falcons</h2>
After failing to adequately address their defensive issues this offseason, the 2016 Falcons likely won't be a much different team than they were in 2015. They should have no problems lighting up the scoreboard with an offense that is full of firepower, but it will be hard for the Falcons to win games if they continue to struggle on the defensive side of the ball.
<h2>20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
The Buccaneers have a young roster full of talent and potential. Their offense will give opposing defensive coordinators headaches if quarterback Jameis Winston takes the next step in his development. They were able to drastically improve their defense (on paper) this offseason. If things go well in Tampa Bay, the Buccaneers could prove to be a surprise postseason contender in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>19. Los Angeles Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_633502" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-633502" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jared-Goff-Jon-Durr-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Jared Goff is selected No. 1 overall in the 2016 NFL Draft. | Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

The Rams have their quarterback of the future in Jared Goff, an All-Pro caliber running back in Todd Gurley, and one of the best defenses in the league. However, with Goff looking like the team's Week 1 starter as a rookie -- behind a subpar offensive line -- the Rams will likely struggle in 2016.
<h2>18. Indianapolis Colts</h2>
The Colts will only go as far as quarterback Andrew Luck carries them. For Luck to find success in 2016, he will need his teammates to stay healthy and his offensive line to do a better job of protecting him. The Colts will still have issues on the defensive side of the ball, but if Luck returns to the All-Pro form he flashed in 2014, this team will contend for a playoff spot in the AFC.
<h2>17. Oakland Raiders</h2>
The Raiders had an excellent offseason. On paper they now look like a team that could contend for the AFC West title in 2016. However, we need to see their offseason success translate to on-field success before we truly buy in.
<h2>16. Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>
The Jaguars are in a similar situation to the Oakland Raiders. They have a roster full of young talent -- aided by their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nfl-draft-6-best-picks-of-the-first-round.html/" target="_blank">stellar 2016 draft class</a>. If they play up to their potential, the Jaguars are capable of winning the AFC South in 2016.
<h2>15. Houston Texans</h2>
The Texans went all-in on quarterback Brock Osweiler, and as long as the 25-year-old signal caller proves to be an above-average player, the Texans will be tough. If he struggles, even J.J. Watt won't be able to save them.
<h2>14. New York Jets</h2>
The Jets have a top-notch defense, and everything in place to be successful on offense if they can get their quarterback situation figured out before the start of the season. Simply put, if Ryan Fitzpatrick is back under center, the Jets are a playoff-caliber team.
<h2>13. Kansas City Chiefs</h2>
The Chiefs are talented and experienced, but in our eyes, they didn't do nearly enough to close the gap between them and the other top contenders in the AFC this offseason. They will benefit from having running back Jamaal Charles back in their lineup, but if All-Pro pass rusher Justin Houston misses time, their defense will suffer. We won't be surprised if the Chiefs make a return trip to the playoffs, but we will be surprised if they don't make another early postseason exit.

<h2>12. New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_606296" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-606296" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Eli-Manning_Tom-Pennington_Getty-Images-640x437.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="517" /> Can Eli Manning lead the New York Giants back to the NFC Playoffs? | Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

The Giants spent huge money this offseason, and we are confident that their financial risks will reward them on the field in 2016. In a wide open NFC East race, the Giants are the team with the best quarterback (in our opinion), and they should be vastly improved on the defensive side of the ball this season. If they stay healthy and see things break their way, the Giants could be one of the better teams in the NFC in 2016.
<h2>11. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
As we learned in 2015, the Cowboys success (or lack thereof) hinges on the health of quarterback Tony Romo. If he is healthy and stays healthy, this team could be special in 2016. If not, the Cowboys could end up picking in the top-10 in the 2017 NFL Draft.
<h2>10. Washington Redskins</h2>
The Redskins surprised everyone on their way to winning the 2015 NFC East title. After their impressive offseason, they should be even better in 2016. As we previously mentioned, the NFC East will be wide open this year, but this time around the Redskins won't sneak up on their opponents.
<h2>9. Minnesota Vikings</h2>
The Vikings have everything in place to contend in the NFC in 2016. They proved that they can play with anyone in the league last year, and were actually a shanked 27-yard field goal from knocking off the Seattle Seahawks in the 2015 NFC Playoffs. A lot of their 2016 season will depend on the development of quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, but as long as Adrian Peterson is healthy and their defense is at the top of its game, the Vikings will be competitive.
<h2>8. New England Patriots</h2>
Don't fly of the handle here. This ranking reflects the Patriots without quarterback Tom Brady, who as of now is suspended for the first four games of the season. If we knew Brady was going to have his suspension overturned, the Patriots would be the No. 1 team in our power rankings.
<h2>7. Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
Will this be the year that the Bengals finally get over the hump and win a playoff game? They have everything in place to be one of the top teams in the AFC (again), but it will be all for naught if they make a sixth-straight early playoff exit in 2016 (again).

<h2>6. Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_586217" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-586217" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ben-Roethlisberger_Dilip-Vishwanat_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Ben Roethlisberger and the Pittsburgh Steelers may have the best offense in the league. | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

The Steelers may have the best offense in the league, which should be enough to keep them in every game they play this season. If their defense comes together, this could be a Super Bowl-caliber team.
<h2>5. Carolina Panthers</h2>
The Panthers will again be one of the top teams in the league, but we actually see them taking a small step back in 2016. Here's why. They lost All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman and failed to adequately replace him, and they did little to improve their lackluster offensive line.
<h2>4. Arizona Cardinals</h2>
When it comes down to it, the Cardinals may actually have the most complete roster in the league. They proved in the past that they can play with and beat anybody, but they will have to stay healthy to do so in 2016. This team is a legitimate Super Bowl contender.

<h2>3. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_628007" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-628007" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Von-Miller_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-640x436.jpg" alt="The Best and Worst NFL Teams of 2016" width="757" height="515" /> Can Von Miller and the Denver Broncos repeat as Super Bowl champions? | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Most people are worried about the Broncos' quarterback situation, but in reality, their quarterback play in 2015 was nothing short of disastrous and that wasn't even enough to keep them from winning the Super Bowl. Despite losing Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan, the Broncos should have one of the best defenses in the game again. As they proved last year, it is all they need to compete for a world championship.
<h2>2. Green Bay Packers</h2>
The Packers had a great offseason thus far. They will be one of the top contenders to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LI next February. They should be better on defense, and the return of wide receiver Jordy Nelson will definitely boost their offense. And, of course, they still have the best offensive player in the game in quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
<h2>1. Seattle Seahawks</h2>
As long as the Seahawks can keep their nucleus (Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Michael Bennett, Bobby Wagner, Jimmy Graham, and Kam Chancellor) intact during the prime of their respective careers, they will be legitimate Super Bowl contenders. As of now, the Seahawks are the team to beat in the NFC.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_685520" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685520" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Nelson-Cobb_Stacy-Revere_Getty-Images-1024x764.jpg" alt="Stacy Revere/Getty Images" width="757" height="565" /> When healthy, Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb may give the Green Bay Packers the best wide receiver duo in the NFL | Stacy Revere/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the last <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-contracts-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">couple of decades</a>, offensive schemes in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> have changed dramatically. Gone are the days (for the most part) of offenses built around a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-best-rookie-seasons-by-a-running-back-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">punishing rushing attack and a workhorse running back</a>. In today’s NFL, there are still teams that place a heavy emphasis on the running game, but it is far more common to see an offense that is built to beat their opponents through the air with a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/lead-nfl-passing-yards-vegas-odds.html/" target="_blank">high-flying passing attack</a>. With that being the case, it can be said that wide receivers and running backs have now basically swapped roles when it comes to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-receiving-yards-leaders-odds.html/" target="_blank">expectations for offensive production</a>. Knowing this, it should come as no surprise that most teams have now made it a priority to build a roster that features at least two standout players at the wide receiver position.

One team that has done just that is the Green Bay Packers. They have two legitimate Pro Bowl wide receivers in Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb, and when you consider the fact that they have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/current-nfl-hall-fame-players.html/" target="_blank">All-Pro quarterback Aaron Rodgers</a> throwing them the ball, it almost seems unfair for opposing defensive backs. Be that as it may, you aren’t going to find the Packers on our list of the top wide receiver duos in the league today.

In case you missed it, Nelson is coming off of a torn ACL he suffered during Week 1 of the 2015 season, and he has <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/08/22/packers-wideout-jordy-nelson-to-return-to-individual-drills-today/" target="_blank">yet to fully participate</a> in any of Green Bay’s training camp practices. Since we don’t know if he will be healthy for the start of the 2016 season, we chose to leave the Packers off of our list for now. If Nelson returns to his pre-injury form, it will instantly elevate the Packers into one of the top two spots in our rankings.

Now that we have that out of the way, here is a look at our rankings of the top 10 wide receiver duos in the NFL today.

<em>* Note: New England Patriots tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Martellus Bennett would have easily made our list, but we chose not to factor in tight ends.</em>

<h2>10. Dez Bryant and Terrance Williams – Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_546028" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-546028 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dez-Bryant_Al-Bello_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Al Bello/Getty ImagesWide receiver Dez Bryant (#88) of the Dallas Cowboys celebrates a touchdown against the New York Giants in 2014." width="757" height="514" /> The Dallas Cowboys will benefit greatly from the return of Dez Bryant | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

The Cowboys only had Bryant on the field for nine games in 2015, and it was painfully obvious that his absence contributed significantly to their 4-12 overall record. With Bryant out, Williams stepped up nicely and hauled in 52 passes for 830 yards and three touchdowns. And with both players on the field in 2016, the Cowboys should be much better on the offensive side of the ball. Expect to see both players come close to the 1,000-yard plateau this year.

<h2>9. Travis Benjamin and Keenan Allen – San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_655970" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-655970" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Keenan-Allen_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images-1024x695.jpg" alt="Jeff Gross/Getty Images" width="757" height="514" /> Keenan Allen is one of the most underrated wide receivers in the league | Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]

This wide receiver duo has flown under the radar all offseason, but could ultimately prove to be one of the most productive in the league when it’s all said and done. Last year, Allen (pictured above) was on pace to have an All-Pro caliber season before landing on the Chargers’ injured reserve list with a lacerated kidney. And Benjamin, who is diminutive but explosive, is a new face in San Diego after signing with the team during free agency this offseason. If the Chargers can do an adequate job of protecting Philip Rivers, expect to see both of these guys catch 80 or more passes for over 1,000 yards in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief – Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_660495" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-660495" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/TY-Hilton_Andy-Lyons_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> T.Y. Hilton should post big numbers with Andrew Luck back on the field in 2016 | Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

With Andrew Luck back at full-strength, the Colts should have one of the best passing attacks in the NFL this year. And as a direct result, his top-two wide receivers – Hilton and Moncrief – should have big seasons in 2016.

With Luck on the field for only seven games in 2015, Hilton and Moncrief combined to catch 133 passes for 1,857 and 11 touchdowns. Those numbers will almost surely increase substantially in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. Larry Fitzgerald and John Brown – Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661870" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661870" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Larry-Fitzgerald_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> The Arizona Cardinals have one of the top wide receiver groups in the NFL | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

While Fitzgerald, who is a future Hall of Famer, and Brown were the Cardinals top-two receivers in 2015, they actually have a third player, Michael Floyd, who wasn’t far behind them. Last year, both Fitzgerald and Brown went over the 1,000-yard mark, and Floyd finished the season with 849 yards. All three players are extremely physically gifted, and with Carson Palmer throwing them the ball, we fully expect them to replicate those numbers in 2016.

<h2>6. Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree – Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_568015" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-568015" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Amari-Cooper_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree give the Oakland Raiders a dynamic wide receiver duo | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The future finally looks bright in Oakland after the Raiders have spent the last 13 seasons as bottom-feeders in the AFC. One of the main reasons for the optimism in Oakland is the dynamic wide receiver duo of second-year pro Amari Cooper, who has the look of a future All-Pro, and seven-year NFL veteran Michael Crabtree. Both players are close to being the complete package when it comes to their skillsets as wide receivers, and they will have a rising star in quarterback Derek Carr throwing them the ball.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu – Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_674016" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674016" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Julio-Jones_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu could give the Atlanta Falcons the best wide receiver duo in the NFC | Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite releasing veteran Roddy White, who holds almost every career franchise receiving record, the Falcons will again have one of the best wide receiver duos in the league in 2016. Julio Jones, who many people believe is the best player at the position in the NFL, is leading the way, and the Falcons went out and added Mohamed Sanu to compliment him during free agency. Jones will likely again contend for the league-lead in receptions, yardage, and touchdowns, and we wouldn’t be surprised if Sanu has a career-year in 2016 as well.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Antonio Brown and Markus Wheaton – Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658668" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Antonio-Brown_Justin-K.-Aller_Getty-Images-1-1024x641.jpg" alt="Justin K. Aller/Getty Images" width="757" height="474" /> Antonio Brown is the best all-around wide receiver in the NFL | Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

The Steelers would rank even higher on this list if Martavis Bryant weren’t suspended for the entire season. Fortunately for the Steelers, they should be just fine without Bryant. They have the best all-around wide receiver in the game today in Antonio Bryant, and fourth-year pro Markus Wheaton has emerged as a legitimate No. 2 NFL wide receiver over the last couple of years. We wouldn’t be surprised if both players are selected to the Pro Bowl in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson – Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685624" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-685624" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Allen-Robinson_Sam-Greenwood_Getty-Images-1024x696.jpg" alt="Sam Greenwood/Getty Images" width="757" height="515" /> Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns have quietly developed into one of the premier wide receiver duos in the NFL | Sam Greenwood/Getty Images[/caption]

You may be surprised to see Hurns and Robinson (pictured above) this high on our list, however we just couldn’t ignore their growth and production in 2015. Granted, they benefitted (statistically) from playing from behind for most of the season, but there is no denying that both Hurns and Robinson are premier NFL wide receivers. Both players are physically imposing, explosive, and excellent route runners. If their quarterback, Blake Bortles, can continue his development, Hurns and Robinson will each have Pro Bowl caliber season in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker – New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_579356" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-579356" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brandon-Marshall_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-1024x672.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="497" /> Brandon Marshall has given the New York Jets an All-Pro caliber wide receiver | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

We thought it was extremely foolish of the Jets to pay big money to sign Decker back in 2014, as the six-year veteran simply does not have the skillset to be a No. 1 wide receiver in the NFL. Now that they have paired him with Marshall, who is a legitimate No. 1 wideout, Decker is in a much better position to succeed. In 2015, Marshall and Decker teamed up to catch 189 passes for 2,529 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Both players possess great size, and are excellent route runners. And if this list were a ranking of best red zone duos, Marshall and Decker would rank No. 1.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas – Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_685630" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="wp-image-685630" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sanders-Thomas_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="800" height="534" /> Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas give the Denver Broncos the best wide receiver duo in the NFL | Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

The fact that the Broncos have two All-Pro caliber wide receivers that are both in the prime of their respective careers often gets overlooked by the team’s uncertainty at the quarterback position. Thomas is coming off of a disappointing season (by his standards) in which he caught 105 passes for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Sanders had 76 catches for 1,135 yards and six touchdowns in 2015. To put some perspective on their greatness, Thomas and Sanders posted those numbers while playing with arguably the worst quarterback in the league last year. Expect to see both players improve statistically in 2016.

		<description><![CDATA[Very few NFL players are able to step in and play at a high level right away. Here's a look at the 5 best rookie seasons by a quarterback in NFL history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_788467" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-788467 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RGIII_NFL-Draft.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="522" /> It's painful to remember now, but RGIII's rookie season was seriously impressive | Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

We have said many times before that<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall"> quarterback is the most important position in football</a>. That statement has proven to be true dating all the way back to the first game of football ever played. In today’s NFL, quarterback play tends to dictate the success of an entire franchise. Landing an elite, franchise quarterback in the NFL Draft can propel a team into a decade or more of success. For some, an elite quarterback can lead a team from being highly successful to being a dynasty.

Given the importance of the position, it should come as no surprise that quarterbacks are the most heavily scouted and scrutinized players leading up to the annual NFL Draft. Even so, teams continuously swing for the fences and miss when it comes to drafting quarterbacks. With the difficulty in projecting future NFL production at the quarterback position, there have been few prospects through the years that were viewed by coaches and personnel staffs as can’t-miss players.

Additionally, quarterbacks are the least likely position on the field to achieve instant success in the NFL. Several players have needed as many as three or four years to adjust to being a professional quarterback and serving as the face of a franchise. With that being said, some of the best rookie seasons by quarterbacks in NFL history have come from some unexpected players.

Turning in a solid rookie season does not guarantee players will go on to be Hall of Fame players. Likewise, an up-and-down rookie season does not mean that player will be destined for mediocrity at the NFL level. Some players just so happen to walk into far better situations for their first professional seasons.

In narrowing down this list to only five quarterbacks, we were forced to leave off players who were impressive in their rookie seasons. Guys like Andrew Luck and Greg Cook were both Pro Bowl-caliber quarterbacks in their first NFL seasons, but their rookie seasons weren’t quite as good as the five players we chose to include. Without further ado, here is a look at the top five rookie seasons by a quarterback in NFL history.

<h2>1. Robert Griffin III, 2012</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789878" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789878 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Robert-Griffin-III_2012.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="605" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>65.6% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>3,200 passing yards</li>
 	<li>20 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>5 interceptions</li>
 	<li>8.1 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>102.4 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>815 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>7 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
The Washington Redskins mortgaged their future to move up in the 2012 NFL Draft to select RGIII with the second overall pick. They sent three first-round and one-second round pick to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for the rights to select the 2011 Heisman Trophy winner. After Griffin’s rookie season, it appeared as though the Redskins had gotten a fair deal in what seemed like an overwhelmingly lopsided trade at the time.

Griffin led Washington to its first playoff appearance since 2007 and set rookie records for the highest quarterback rating and the highest touchdown-to-interception ratio of all time. On top of proving to be a more polished passer than anyone had expected, he was also a serious threat as a ball carrier, rushing for more than 800 yards and seven touchdowns as a rookie.

Unfortunately for the Redskins, RGIII’s rookie year has been by far the best season of his career. After two below-average seasons and a couple of major injuries, he left Washington in disgrace and looks to revive his career in Cleveland.

<h2>2. Dan Marino, 1983</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789879" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789879 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dan-Marino_Dolphins.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="515" /> Rhona Wise/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>58.4% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,210 passing yards</li>
 	<li>20 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>6 interceptions</li>
 	<li>7.5 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>96.0 quarterback rating</li>
</ul>
Marino will go down as one of the all-time biggest NFL Draft snubs. Yes, he was a first-round pick, but there were still <a title="The Greatest Draft in NFL History" href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl-mock-draft/2013/4/23/4255516/elway-to-marino" target="_blank">five other quarterbacks</a> selected ahead of him in 1983. Two of them, John Elway and Jim Kelly, went on to be Hall of Fame quarterbacks themselves, but the other three — Todd Blackledge, Tony Eason, and Ken O’Brien — shouldn’t even be mentioned in the same breath as Marino.

Marino stepped into the starting role for the Miami Dolphins in Week 6 of his rookie season and would go on to hold the position for the next 17 seasons. In his nine starts as a rookie, Marino gave the NFL world an accurate preview of what he would become as an NFL quarterback. He went on to earn second-team All-Pro honors, was selected to the 1983 Pro Bowl, and won the NFL Rookie of the Year award.

<h2>3. Cam Newton, 2011</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789880" align="aligncenter" width="751"]<img class="wp-image-789880 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cam-Newton_Panthers.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="751" height="1024" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>60.0% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>4,051 passing yards</li>
 	<li>21 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>17 interceptions</li>
 	<li>7.2 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>84.5 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>706 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>14 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
The Carolina Panthers made Newton the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft just months after the 6-foot-5, 245-pound quarterback ad won the 2010 Heisman Trophy and led Auburn to the BCS National Championship. He was almost instantly named the starter in Carolina and would go on to have an excellent rookie season in the NFL.

Newton proved to be a true dual-threat quarterback and one of the top playmakers in the league during his first professional season after throwing 21 touchdown passes and rushing for another 14 scores. He would earn a trip to the Pro Bowl as a rookie and was a near-unanimous selection as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for the 2011 season, not to mention leading his team to Super Bowl 50.

<h2>4. Russell Wilson, 2012</h2>
[caption id="attachment_789881" align="aligncenter" width="737"]<img class="wp-image-789881 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Russell-Wilson_Rookie.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="1024" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie Stats:</span>
<ul>
 	<li>64.1% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>3,118 passing yards</li>
 	<li>26 touchdown passes</li>
 	<li>10 interceptions</li>
 	<li>7.9 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>100.0 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>489 rushing yards</li>
 	<li>4 rushing touchdowns</li>
</ul>
Russell Wilson may go down as the <a title="Wilson Remembers People Ripping Seattle's 2012 Draft Class" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24433089/russell-wilson-remembers-people-ripping-seahawks-2012-draft-class" target="_blank">biggest Draft Day steal of all time</a> by the end of his career. Like Montana in 1979, Wilson was a third-round pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. The Seattle Seahawks selected Wilson with the 75th overall pick, and unlike Montana, Wilson would go on to win his team’s starting job during training camp as a rookie. He started off his rookie year as a more of a game manager than a playmaker, but that changed by the midway point of the 2012 season.

Wilson quickly evolved into one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks in the league and led the Seahawks to a playoff appearance in his first year on the job. After wildly exceeding expectations, Wilson won the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award and was selected to the 2012 Pro Bowl.

<h2>5. Ben Roethlisberger, 2004</h2>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Rookie stats</span>:
<ul>
 	<li>66.4% completion percentage</li>
 	<li>2,621 passing yards</li>
 	<li>17 touchdown passes</li>

 	<li>8.9 yards per attempt</li>
 	<li>98.1 quarterback rating</li>
 	<li>144 rushing yards</li>

</ul>
The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Roethlisberger with the 11th overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft, and their choice paid near-immediate dividends. After beginning the season as the team’s backup, Roethlisberger took over the starting job when Tommy Maddox obtained an injury early in the 2004 season.

From there, all Big Ben did was lead the Steelers to a 13-0 regular-season record and a trip to the AFC Championship Game as the team’s starter. In his first professional season, he proved early on that he was going to be a dominant force in the NFL for years to come; he went on to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

		<description><![CDATA[The NFC North will feature an interesting battle for the top spot in the division, but who will take the crown? Here are our NFC North predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In previous years, Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-go-undefeated-next-season.html/" target="_blank">ran the NFC North</a>. The Packers finished first in the division in the four years prior to 2015, but last season the return of Adrian Peterson and some strong defensive play helped the Minnesota Vikings take over the top spot.

Minnesota finished at 11-5, while the Packers went 10-6 and still made the postseason. The NFC North is one of the more interesting divisions, as expectations were high during the past few seasons for all four teams. While we've already checked out the predictions for other divisions, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/preseason-nfc-south-predictions.html/" target="_blank">including the NFC South</a>, let's review our NFC North predictions for the season, breaking it down by order and then more specific forecasts.
<ol>
 	<li>Green Bay Packers</li>
 	<li>Minnesota Vikings</li>
 	<li>Detroit Lions</li>
 	<li>Chicago Bears</li>
</ol>
<h2>Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589397" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589397" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bridgewater-Rodgers_Adam-Bettcher_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC North Predictions" width="757" height="505" /> Minnesota Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater speaks with Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. | Adam Bettcher/Getty Images[/caption]

A healthy Jordy Nelson equals a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/aaron-rodgers-stats-greats.html/" target="_blank">happy Aaron Rodgers</a>. The fact is, Rodgers wasn't the same quarterback we've seen in past years without his favorite wide receiver, but this will all go back to normal in 2016.

We actually expect the Packers to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-with-the-most-favorable-schedules-next-season.html/" target="_blank">win the division</a> by possibly two games, making it easier for the group down the home stretch. While the Vikings are still immensely talented, and could very well be in the mix for a postseason berth, they won't be able to slow down Green Bay this season.

Surprisingly, the Packers allowed just 20.2 points-per-game last season defensively, ranking them No. 12 in the NFL. Pairing their strong defense with a full-strength offense makes them not only ridiculously dangerous, but also one of the favorites to possibly <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-heres-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-super-bowl-li.html/" target="_blank">contend for a Super Bowl</a> next season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_485083" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-485083" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/182309483.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC North Predictions" width="757" height="524" /> Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson | Jamie McDonald/Getty Images[/caption]

Adrian Peterson flat out <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/adrian-peterson-career-stats.html/" target="_blank">isn't human</a>. The guy is now beyond the dreaded age of 30, but it <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-running-backs-best-2016-seasons.html/" target="_blank">doesn't even matter</a>. Minnesota is most effective offensively when they return to the ground-and-pound offense with Peterson.

While Teddy Bridgewater has a bright future in the NFL, they finally realized that at certain times the team  needed to get the ball to AP and block for the man. Do we expect Peterson to get 327 carries again in 2016? It's tough to gauge, as this was the third-most of his career, but the fact that he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-fantasy-football-adrian-peterson.html/" target="_blank">didn't slow down</a> along the way makes you think there's a good chance it could happen.

Regardless, while fans may look for more out of Bridgewater next season, we aren't sure it will happen, largely due to the fact that what Minnesota did last season worked well. To go along with that, their defense is more than talented enough to get them back in the push for the postseason.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Detroit Lions</h2>
[caption id="attachment_545777" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-545777 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Detroit-Lions_Leon-Halip_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC North Predictions" width="757" height="447" /> Detroit Lions huddle | Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

Not <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/" target="_blank">having Calvin Johnson</a> in 2016 was obviously about the worst possible scenario that Lions fans could have imagined at the end of 2015. While one of the greatest wide receivers of our decade has decided to call it a career -- and it will hurt Detroit badly -- we still believe they'll do enough to hold off the Chicago Bears and avoid falling into the cellar of the division.

What stands out about Detroit is the fact that they've improved both their offensive and defensive lines, which is huge. The less Matthew Stafford gets hit, the more time he'll have to allow his wide outs to get open. On top of that, Ameer Abdullah could be poised for a nice breakthrough season in 2016, after showing flashes of brilliance last season.

While the pairing of Golden Tate and Marvin Jones isn't the same as Johnson and Tate, it's still strong enough to help the offense move the ball. Let's not forget tight end Eric Ebron, who improved nicely in his second season, catching 47 passes for 537 yards and five touchdowns.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_497319" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-497319" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cutler-Bears.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC North Predictions" width="757" height="532" /> Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler | Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

It's so close. The Bears have a valid argument for moving up from No. 4 in the division, but we believe some people are slightly too excited about the Alshon Jeffery/Kevin White pairing. While both players should be fun to watch, Jay Cutler has <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/bears-will-never-win-super-bowl-with-jay-cutler.html/" target="_blank">shown so much inconsistency</a> throughout his career, and White has never touched the field for an actual NFL game.

To go along with that, some people believe Jeremy Langford is ready to fully take over for Matt Forte, but with the selection of Jordan Howard in the 2016 NFL Draft, that makes us think otherwise. As for their defense, the No. 9 pick Leonard Floyd is a good one. However, while the focus is on him gaining weight this offseason, we're not sure he'll be ready to make a big impact from the word go.

There are just so many <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/no-faith-nfl-teams.html/" target="_blank">questions surrounding the Bears</a>, which makes them a tough team to judge. Chicago's defense also allowed 24.8 points-per-game defensively in 2015, which doesn't add any confidence while putting out a prediction for the team this season. The Bears are on the fringe of contending for the playoffs, but it's going to take another season or two.

		<description><![CDATA[The Dallas Cowboys had a rough showing in 2015. Here are 3 bold predictions for this team in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_812278" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-812278 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tony-Romo_Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="534" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

For fans of the Dallas Cowboys, to say that the 2015 season was a disappointment would be a massive understatement. This team entered the season as one of the more intriguing bets to make a run at the Super Bowl, but they wound up being one of <a title="the biggest disappointments" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-teams-that-were-a-disappointment-this-season.html/" target="_blank">the biggest disappointments</a> in the entire league. While losing your quarterback and top wide receiver for a good chunk of the season obviously hurts, no one quite expected it to be as bad as the 4-12 finish that we saw at the end of the year.

Such a rough year poses the simple question: What’s next for the Cowboys? The only good thing about a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/2015.htm" target="_blank">four-win season</a> is the fact that Dallas now gets the No. 4 pick in the 2016 NFL draft. This pick should result in either an instant-impact player or a quarterback who the team could mold to become the future behind Tony Romo. In either situation, Dallas will be a team to watch in 2016 and should open up the year as the favorite in a below-average NFC East. With the season still a ways away, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t make a few predictions about this team. Let’s start things off with the quarterback himself.
<h2>1. Tony Romo posts similar numbers to 2014</h2>
In 2014, aka the great DeMarco Murray year, it was pretty overlooked that Romo actually threw for 34 touchdowns against just nine interceptions. He was stellar and proved that he still had plenty left in the tank. That season happened after many doubters assumed that he was pretty much done and wouldn’t be nearly as effective as he had been in the past. So, in 2016, we see Romo silencing those doubters once again.

While most say that he’ll never be the same quarterback as he was before, we think he will not only pass for 34 touchdowns, but keep his interceptions under 10 as well. Romo and the Cowboys will utilize the run game in a great way, and whether it’s Darren McFadden, a rookie, or someone else entirely, they will have a big year running behind that offensive line. Expect Romo to once again prove that players can come back from injuries and still light the NFL on fire.

<h2>2. Demarcus Lawrence finishes top five in the NFL in sacks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_945949" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-945949" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-DeMarcus-Lawrence-Dallas-Cowboys.jpg" alt="DeMarcus Lawrence #90 of the Dallas Cowboys at AT&amp;T Stadium (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)" width="757" height="501" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Lawrence <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LawrDe00.htm" target="_blank">finished the season with eight sacks</a>. Over his final eight games, he had seven of his eight sacks, and was constantly in the face of opposing quarterbacks. A sign of things to come? You better believe it. Lawrence will face a lot of pressure next year, as it’s likely that he will be the featured pass-rusher due to the unlikelihood of the team re-signing Greg Hardy.

Fortunately for the third-year pro, Lawrence has upped his game and seems poised to take that next step for the Cowboys defense — something they badly need. When looking at the top five in sacks from 2015, there was J.J. Watt (17.5), Khalil Mack (15), Ezekiel Ansah (14.5), Carlos Dunlap (13.5), and Chandler Jones (12.5). It’s tough to predict exactly where Lawrence will land, but we are confident that he will hit the ground running and find his way onto that list of studs.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. The Cowboys make the NFC championship game</h2>
[caption id="attachment_879762" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-879762" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Dez-Bryant-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Pennington/Getty Images" width="757" height="461" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

The team that is one of the most disliked in the entire NFL will finally get over that hump and make a postseason run. Whether it comes from a first-round bye or two wins, the Cowboys will make it to the NFC championship game. Who will their opponent be? Expect either the Arizona Cardinals or Carolina Panthers to make the trip back to the game and take on Jerry’s Boys.

It’ll be more than just Romo who helps get this job done. A healthy Orlando Scandrick will improve the secondary, the run game will roll, and Sean Lee will once again be the defensive leader who Dallas turned to in 2015. It may not be McFadden, but whoever the lead back in Dallas is, he will run wild all season long.

As for the name who so many waited to read here? Dez Bryant will return to an elite level in 2016. Because, let’s be honest, if Bryant wasn’t playing at his highest capacity, what are the Cowboys’ chances of seriously competing for a Super Bowl? Romo may still have the goods, but he needs a stud wide receiver to pick apart defenses.

		<description><![CDATA[Being a head coach in the NFL is the pinnacle of the football coaching industry. That said, here is a look at the 6 highest-paid coaches in the NFL in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coaching in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> is a career path that is not for the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-worst-free-agency-contracts-of-the-2016-offseason.html/" target="_blank">faint of heart</a>. On top of the fact that it is nearly impossible to break into the business, NFL coaches also have to find a way to cope with working 20-plus hour workdays, and they have to be comfortable with the notion that one bad season or one <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-player-arrests-2016.html/" target="_blank">off the field mishap</a> can result in them either <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-coaches-hot-seat-2016-season.html/" target="_blank">landing on the dreaded coaching hot seat</a> or losing their job altogether. With that being said, becoming a head coach in the NFL does come with a few perks.

On top of the overwhelming sense of professional accomplishment that comes with reaching the pinnacle of the industry, NFL head coaches also often make enough money to set themselves and their families up for generations to come. With that being the case, here is a look at the six highest-paid coaches in the NFL for the 2016 season.
<h2>5. (tie) John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens - $7 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676868" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676868" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/John-Harbaugh_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-1024x714.jpg" alt="John Harbaugh" width="757" height="528" /> The Baltimore Ravens signed John Harbaugh to a contract extension that made him one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The Ravens took a major chance on Harbaugh when they hired him to replace Brian Billick as their head coach back in 2008. The 53-year-old coach was coming off of a 10-year stint with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he spent his first nine seasons as the team’s special teams coordinator and his final season as their defensive backs coach. While his resume was impressive, he had zero previous head coaching experience and the next logical step in his career progression appeared to be moving into a role as an offensive or defensive coordinator or taking a head-coaching job at the college level. And after eight seasons as the head coach in Baltimore, it’s safe to say that Harbaugh was well worth the risk for Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome.

He has compiled a 77-51 overall record, won two division titles, and won Super Bowl XLVII in 2012. And as a result, it should come as no surprise that the contract extension he signed in 2013 made Harbaugh one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL.

<h2>5. (tie) Jeff Fisher, Los Angeles Rams - $7 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_626603" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-626603" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jeff-Fisher_Leon-Bennett_Getty-Images-1024x683.jpg" alt="Jeff Fisher is one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL despite his below average record with the Los Angeles Rams" width="757" height="505" /> Jeff Fisher is one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL despite his below average record with the Los Angeles Rams | Leon Bennett/Getty Images[/caption]

To be blunt, we are shocked that Fisher still has a job with the Rams. For as stunned as we are that he is still employed, we are even more flabbergasted that he is one of the highest-paid coaches in the National Football League. He has a career overall record of 169-156-1, and a 27-36-1 record as the head coach of the Rams. In 21 seasons as an NFL head coach, Fisher has led his teams to six postseason appearances and one conference championship, and six division titles -- all of which came with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans. When it comes to his time with the Rams, we are convinced that the only reason Fisher still has a job is the franchise’s unwillingness to pay him the multi-million dollar buyout that would come with him getting fired.

<h2>3. (tie) Andy Reid, Kansas City Chiefs - $7.5 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676873" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676873" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Andy-Reid_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1-1024x712.jpg" alt="Andy Reid" width="757" height="526" /> The Kansas City Chiefs made Andy Reid one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the course of his 17 seasons as an NFL head coach, Reid has proven to be an excellent motivator, a great personnel evaluator, and one of the best offensive minds in the game. He was fired by the Philadelphia Eagles following the 2012 season, but in Reid’s defense, his dismissal from Philadelphia was more of a mutual agreement to part ways. He was quickly scooped up by the Chiefs, who signed him to a five-year, $37.5 million deal during the 2013 offseason.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. (tie) Bill Belichick, New England Patriots - $7.5 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676876" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676876" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bill-Belichick_Elsa_Getty-Images-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Bill Belichick" width="757" height="505" /> Bill Belichick is rightfully one of the highest-paid coaches in the NFL | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, no price tag would be too high for Belichick’s services. He has built the Patriots into one of the greatest dynasties in NFL history, and undoubtedly has a place waiting for him in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. What’s even more amazing about Belichick’s body of work in New England is that on top of being an exceptional coach, he has also been arguably the best General Manager in the league for most of the last decade.

<h2>2. Pete Carroll, Seattle Seahawks - $8 million</h2>
[caption id="attachment_676880" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-676880" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Pete-Carroll_Grant-Halverson_Getty-Images-1024x682.jpg" alt="Pete Carrol" width="757" height="504" /> Pete Carroll has turned the Seattle Seahawks into a powerhouse, and as a result, he is one of the highest-paid coaches in the league | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

Needless to say, Carroll’s second stint as an NFL head coach has been vastly better than his first. Since taking the job in Seattle in 2010, Carroll has led the Seahawks to a 60-36 regular season record, an 8-4 postseason record, three division titles, two NFC titles, and the Super Bowl XLVIII title in 2013. With a resume like that, it’s no wonder he just <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/pete-carrolls-contract-negotiations-should-be-comforting-news-for-seahawks-fans/" target="_blank">landed a contract extension</a> that made him the second-highest paid coach in the league.

<h2>1. Sean Payton, New Orleans Saints - $8 million</h2>

Considering the job that he has done in New Orleans, we weren’t the least bit surprised to find that Payton <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/3/23/11290132/sean-payton-5-year-extension-saints" target="_blank">signed a contract extension</a> that currently makes him the highest-paid coach in the NFL. Since taking over as the head coach of the Saints in 2006, all Payton has done is turn a franchise that had been one of the biggest laughing stocks in NFL history, into a Super Bowl champion (they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV in 2009), a nearly unstoppable offensive juggernaut, and a perennial contender in the NFC. If the Saints were to ever part ways with Payton, there is no doubting that he will have no trouble finding another job.

		<description><![CDATA[In the NFL, breakout seasons lead to stardom and success. These 11 up-and-coming players are primed to break out in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every year the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> sees players enjoy breakout seasons that lead to fame and fortune. Last year, guys like cornerback Josh Norman, defensive end/outside linebacker Khalil Mack, defensive tackle Aaron Donald, and wide receiver Allen Robinson all seemingly came out of nowhere to emerge as some of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-the-2016-mvp-award.html/" target="_blank">best players in the league</a> at their respective positions.

With the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/2016-nfl-season/" target="_blank">2016 NFL season</a> rapidly approaching, we put together a list of players who are likely on the verge of experiencing breakout seasons. These 11 players have a combined zero Pro Bowl appearances and zero All-Pro selections, but we see these things changing this year.

Several players on this list will likely burst onto the NFL scene in 2016. With that said, here is a look at 11 players who are strong candidates to have breakout seasons in 2016.
<h2>DeVante Parker, WR, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639311" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639311" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DeVante-Parker_Alex-Goodlett_Getty-Images-640x417.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="493" /> Will DeVante Parker emerge as a Pro Bowl candidate in head coach Adam Gase's offense? | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

DeVante Parker’s rookie season (2015) was severely limited due to a foot injury that he suffered during training camp. When he was healthy, though, the former Louisville Cardinal flashed signs of brilliance, as he caught 22 passes for 445 yards and three touchdowns in the Dolphins’ final six games of the 2015 season.

By all accounts, Parker is now fully healthy. With a full offseason to work with quarterback Ryan Tannehill in new head coach Adam Gase’s offense, we wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if the 6-foot-3, 209-pounder goes over 1,000 receiving yards and emerges as the Dolphins’ No. 1 wide receiver in 2016, leading to an incredible breakout season.

<h2>Coby Fleener, TE, New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Coby-Fleener_Elsa_Getty-Images-1.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Will Coby Fleener be the next Pro Bowl tight end for the New Orleans Saints? | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

You could easily argue that Coby Fleener had a breakout season in 2014 (51 receptions for 774 yards and eight touchdowns), but that alone isn’t enough for us. The former Stanford tight end has yet to earn a Pro Bowl or All-Pro selection in his four-year NFL career, but we believe that could change in 2016.

This offseason, Fleener signed with the Saints and is tasked with filling the void of pass-catching tight end in head coach Sean Payton’s offense; a position that Jimmy Graham vacated when he was <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000477780/article/seahawks-get-jimmy-graham-from-saints" target="_blank">traded to the Seattle Seahawks</a>. With the Saints’ uncertainty at wide receiver, we envision Fleener getting at least 100 targets, resulting in 60+ catches, 800+ receiving yards, and close to 10 touchdowns in 2016.
<h2>Kony Ealy, DE, Carolina Panthers</h2>
Kony Ealy showed what he is capable of in Super Bowl 50, racking up four tackles, three sacks, and an interception against the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/denver-broncos/" target="_blank">Denver Broncos</a>. He only posted five sacks for the Panthers a year ago, but that was in large part because he was playing behind a future Hall of Famer in Jared Allen, who has since retired.

With Allen out of the picture, Ealy will step into a full-time starting role for the first time in his career, and we believe that he will post a double-digit sack total and possibly earn a spot on the NFC Pro Bowl roster in 2016.

<h2>David Johnson, RB, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639299" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639299" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/David-Johnson_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-1-518x500.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="730" /> Will David Johnson emerge as a Pro Bowler in 2016? | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Arizona head coach Bruce Arians has been <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000638149/article/arians-david-johnson-can-be-one-of-the-alltime-best" target="_blank">raving about</a> David Johnson’s potential all offseason and has also made it clear that the second-year pro will be the Cardinals’ workhorse running back in 2016. The former Northern Iowa standout is one of the most explosive backs and arguably the best pass-catching back in the league. With an increased workload that will likely be well over 300 touches, Johnson may put up All-Pro caliber numbers in 2016.
<h2>Ladarius Green, TE, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
With Heath Miller’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14807385/pittsburgh-steelers-tight-end-heath-miller-retires-11-seasons" target="_blank">decision to retire</a> this offseason, the Steelers suddenly had a pressing need at tight end. They opted to fill it by signing Ladarius Green during free agency, and we actually think the Steelers got better at the position with this acquisition.

Green has spent his entire NFL career with the San Diego Chargers, backing up a future Hall of Famer in Antonio Gates. He will step into a starting role in arguably the best offense in the league in 2016. At 6-foot-6 and 237 pounds, Green presents a dynamic target for Ben Roethlisberger, and we believe the 25-year-old tight end will post Pro Bowl-caliber statistics this year.

<h2>Thomas Rawls, RB, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639301" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639301" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Thomas-Rawls_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-1-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Will Thomas Rawls emerge from Marshawn Lynch's shadow in 2016? | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Based on what we saw from Thomas Rawls as a rookie in 2015 (during his time filling in for Marshawn Lynch), we believe that the former undrafted free agent is on the verge of becoming a bona fide NFL star. He will be the Seahawks’ starter in 2016, and simply put, we would be shocked if he doesn’t rush for over 1,000 yards -- he just has to stay healthy for the entire season.
<h2>Weston Richburg, C, New York Giants</h2>
As a whole, offensive linemen tend to fly under the radar. And Weston Richburg has fallen victim to this. Pro Football Focus graded out the former Colorado State standout as the third-best center in the league in 2015, yet he still goes unnoticed by most football fans. We believe this will change in 2016, as Richburg has a legitimate chance to earn All-Pro or Pro Bowl honors if he continues to dominate.

<h2>Jeremy Langford, RB, Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639307" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639307" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jeremy-Langford_Mike-McGinnis_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="505" /> Could Matt Forte's absence open the door for a breakout season from Jeremy Langford? | Mike McGinnis/Getty Images[/caption]

After eight exceptional seasons, running back Matt Forte moved on to the New York Jets, which opened the door for Jeremy Langford to step into a starting role in his second year in the league. Based on what we saw from Langford as a rookie in 2015 -- he ran for 537 yards and six touchdowns on 148 carries, and he caught 22 passes for 279 yards and a touchdown -- we firmly believe that big things are in store for the former Michigan State Spartan as he may see a significant increase in touches in 2016.
<h2>Preston Smith, OLB, Washington Redskins</h2>
Preston Smith started all 16 regular-season games for the Redskins as a rookie in 2015, and during the last month of the season, the former Mississippi State Bulldog showed flashes of talent, leading us to believe he could very well develop into a perennial All-Pro candidate in 2016.

Smith will likely benefit greatly from the Redskins’ improvement of the back end of their defense, and with Junior Galette and/or Ryan Kerrigan rushing the passer from the other side of the defensive line, teams won’t be able to focus solely on slowing down the 6-foot-5, 271-pounder. We predict a double-digit sack total and Pro Bowl-caliber play against the run from Smith in 2016

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Jadeveon Clowney, OLB, Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_639684" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-639684" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Jadeveon-Clowney_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images-3-640x439.jpg" alt="NFL: 11 Players Poised to Have Breakout Seasons in 2016" width="757" height="519" /> Will Jadeveon Clowney finally realize his immense potential with the Houston Texans in 2016? | Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

When he entered the NFL back in 2014, Jadeveon Clowney was widely viewed as a once-in-a-generation type of prospect. And up to this point, the former South Carolina Gamecock’s professional career has been largely disappointing. That said, when he has been on the field, Clowney has flashed All-Pro ability.

Now, for the first time in his career, Clowney is fully healthy and has an entire offseason in front of him to further develop his pass-rushing skills. And as we all know, opposing defenses will heavily focus on slowing down defensive end J.J. Watt, which should result in a lot of one-on-one pass rush situations for Clowney in 2016.
<h2>Marvin Jones, WR, Detroit Lions</h2>
With <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-calvin-johnson-deserves-to-be-in-the-hall-of-fame.html/" target="_blank">Calvin Johnson retiring</a> this offseason, the Lions signed free agent Marvin Jones and need the former Cal standout to help ease the pain of losing the best wide receiver in franchise history. This is the first time Jones will be expected to produce as a No. 1 or No. 2 wide receiver on a weekly basis, and based on what he showed during his past two NFL season, we believe he will exceed expectations.

His new quarterback, Matthew Stafford, is a true gunslinger, and with Golden Tate lining up on the other side of the field, Jones should see plenty of one-on-one coverage in 2016. As a result, we fully expect him to go well over 1,000 receiving yards.

		<description><![CDATA[There are always winners and losers when the NFL releases its annual schedule of games. These are the 5 teams with the most favorable schedules.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_627563" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-627563" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tony-Romo_Patrick-Smith_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-who-vegas-is-now-picking-to-win-super-bowl-51.html/" target="_blank">road to Super Bowl LI</a> in Houston, Texas has been laid out for all 32 teams in the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>. Back in April, the NFL released the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000653243/article/nfl-releases-2016-regularseason-schedule" target="_blank">full schedule of games</a> for the 2016 regular season, and as always, some teams were winners and others were losers. Today, we take a look at the teams that “won” by landing the most favorable schedules for the upcoming season.

Strength of schedule (based on the combined overall records of their upcoming opponents from the previous season) is the element that garners the most attention when determining which teams have favorable schedules for the upcoming season, but the truth of the matter is that there are several other factors that also play a major role in assessing the difficulty of each team’s schedule.

Before continuing, we feel compelled to point out that simply using the combined overall records of their opponents from the previous season as the only basis for determining strength of schedule is a completely flawed system.

For example, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/dallas-cowboys/" target="_blank">Dallas Cowboys</a> played most of last season without their starting quarterback, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tony-romo/" target="_blank">Tony Romo</a> (pictured above), and as a result, their 2015 record wasn’t truly indicative of the type of team they can be this year. The Cowboys will have Romo back in their lineup in 2016, which means that their winning percentage of 0.250 in 2015 will likely prove to be an inaccurate gauge of how difficult of an opponent they will be this season.

Knowing this, we decided to consider a handful of other dynamics -- short weeks (playing on Thursday night after playing a game the previous Sunday), home/road stretches, and when/where certain teams fall on each team’s schedule -- in addition to the combined overall records of their upcoming opponents from the previous season to take a more in-depth look at which teams have the most favorable schedules in 2016. Here’s what we came up with.
<h2>1. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
As we previously mentioned, the Cowboys will have Romo back under center, and that alone should make 2016 a much better season for "America’s Team." As far as their schedule goes, the Cowboys have the fourth-lowest strength of schedule in the league (their opponents had a combined winning percentage of just 0.465 in 2015), they have only one short week, and outside of matchups with the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers in Week 5 and Week 6, respectively, they don’t have difficult games in back-to-back weeks at any other point in the season. All said, with this schedule, the Cowboys should have no problem reaching double-digit wins in 2016.

<h2>2. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_627564" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-627564" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Von-Miller-DeMarcus-Ware_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-640x448.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="529" /> Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware of the Denver Broncos | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

The Broncos’ Super Bowl title defense in 2016 won’t be easy, but the league did do them a couple of favors when they put their schedule together. While their opponents do have the 14th<sup> </sup>highest strength of schedule (0.504) in the league, the Broncos have only one short week, they get to play their toughest non-divisional opponents (the Carolina Panthers and the New England Patriots) at home, and they just don’t have a brutal stretch of schedule this year. They may have a lot of roster questions that still need to be answered, but the Broncos have to be pleased with the way the NFL set up their 2016 regular season schedule.
<h2>3. Chicago Bears</h2>
The Bears’ 2016 opponents have the second-lowest combined 2015 winning percentage in the league (0.461), which is something that bodes extremely well for a team that is in rebuilding mode. On top of that, the Bears drew what appears to be the easiest non-divisional slate of games in the league in addition to having only one short week. Looking at this schedule, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the Bears finish above 0.500 this season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_627565" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-627565" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Aaron-Rodgers_Rob-Carr_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Rob Carr/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers | Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]

The Packers have the kind of schedule that should allow them to contend for the No. 1 seed in the NFC Playoffs in 2016. They have the lowest strength of schedule in the league (0.457), one short week, and zero strikingly difficult road games.

In fact, the Packers could easily enter their Week 14 game against the Seattle Seahawks on December 11 with a 12-0 record. The bottom line here is that assuming Aaron Rodgers stays healthy, the Packers could realistically win 13 or more games during the regular season.
<h2>5. Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
The Steelers have the 23rd lowest strength of schedule in the league, but it’s the second half of their 2016 schedule that inspired us to include them on this list. In their last eight games, Pittsburgh will play only one team -- the Cincinnati Bengals -- that had a winning record in 2015 and will have the added benefit of playing the Cleveland Browns twice during that span.

Additionally, the Steelers get to host the New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Kansas City Chiefs at Heinz Field. When it comes down to it, the Steelers’ schedule sets up nicely for them to make a serious run at contending for an AFC title in 2016.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_642303" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-642303" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Denver-Broncos-John-Elway-Victory-Parade-640x427.jpg" alt="4 NFL Teams That Still Need a Quarterback" width="757" height="505" /> Super Bowl 50 Champion Denver Broncos at the Denver City and County Building on February 9, 2016 after their Super Bowl victory parade. | Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

With NFL free agency winding down and the 2016 NFL Draft now in the rearview mirror, teams should be set at the quarterback position, right? Well, not so fast. Unfortunately, a team or two from the list of those who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-we-expect-to-see-fail-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">we expect to see fail</a> in 2016 are also the ones who currently still desperately need a quarterback.

There's a whole lot of uncertainty at this point in the NFL, and it's never a good thing for a team to have uncertainty at the quarterback position at this point in time. With that said, let's jump into it by looking at four teams who still need to figure out their gameplan at the quarterback position in 2016.
<h2>1. Denver Broncos</h2>
Listen, it's really nice that everyone is touting Mark Sanchez as being ready to make some impressive turnaround. If it's not that, it's hearing that rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch will be ready sooner than later (how many times have we heard that before about a rookie?). In all honesty, the Broncos have a stellar defense, plenty of offensive playmakers, but they do not have their sure-fire answer at quarterback. Yes, Lynch may turn out the be the answer down the road, but to throw him into the fire in 2016 would be a pretty bad idea. At this exact moment, the Broncos aren't set at the key position, but that doesn't mean that they won't be within the next year or two potentially. This one falls under the "still needs a QB until proven otherwise."
<h2>2. San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_593074" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-593074" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gabbert-and-Kaepernick-Ezra-Shaw-Getty-Images-1024x739.jpg" alt="4 NFL Teams That Still Need a Quarterback" width="757" height="546" /> Blaine Gabbert and Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers | Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

We have absolutely no idea whether or not Colin Kaepernick can turn things around, but when it looks more and more like Blaine Gabbert is going to be starting for the 49ers in 2016, it's obviously not the best spot. Gabbert did show signs of improvement last season, but he's just not a long-term answer at the position for San Francisco. Unfortunately, the team also did very little in the offseason to address the position (drafted Jeff Driskel), which means that they still fall squarely under the category of "needing a new quarterback." Time to play the wait-and-see game about the future in San Francisco, but if Kaepernick is able to rebound, he could prove quite a few doubters wrong.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_619126" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-619126" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ryan-Fitzpatrick_Jeff-Zelevansky_Getty-Images1-640x427.jpg" alt="4 NFL Teams That Still Need a Quarterback" width="757" height="505" /> Ryan Fitzpatrick of the New York Jets | Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images[/caption]

We were completely sold on the fact that the Jets were going to bring back Ryan Fitzpatrick and wouldn't land on this list. Now, the offseason is speeding up, and it's starting to get slightly more alarming as time goes on. If it doesn't wind up being Fitzpatrick, then we'll be looking at either Geno Smith or Christian Hackenberg starting for the team in 2016.

While Hackenberg is a bit of an unknown, one thing that we do know is that he needs more than one offseason to be prepared to play in the NFL. As for Smith, well, a lot of people are completely uninterested in talking about him as a starter at the NFL level again. Can he prove those people wrong, or will Smith get a chance and flame out again? For now, the Jets badly need to address their quarterback position, because we don't believe either of those guys are ready.
<h2>4. Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_593822" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-593822" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-640x427-640x427.jpg" alt="4 NFL Teams That Still Need a Quarterback" width="757" height="505" /> Robert Griffin III of the Cleveland Browns | Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Cody Kessler being drafted by the Browns doesn't just remove them from this list. Neither does signing Robert Griffin III as a free agent this offseason. The Browns have a lot to prove, and their quarterbacks have even more to prove. Maybe RGIII can turn things around and be the quarterback we saw dominate during his rookie season with the Washington Redskins, but it doesn't seem that way.

His upside is there, but will he be able to turn a corner with the Browns, who are obviously in need of some consistency from their receivers as well? Essentially, the QB situation in Cleveland is one big mess right now, and until we see some type of success from one of these players (or Josh McCown) during the 2016 NFL season, they'll remain squarely on this list.

		<description><![CDATA[The 2016 NFL Draft had some intriguing running backs, but who will be the top producers this coming season?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_632540" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-632540" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NFL-Draft_Chris-McGrath_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Chris McGrath/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell speaks during the draft. | Chris McGrath/Getty Images[/caption]

While we can't say that the NFL draft has turned into a running back's dream just yet, seeing former Ohio State back Ezekiel Elliott go No. 4 overall to the Dallas Cowboys is a great sign for the future of the position.

In terms of talent, there was a clear drop-off after Elliott in terms of talent; most expected Derrick Henry from Alabama to be a second-round pick. In the end, that's how it played out, and we didn't see another back selected until the third round.

Fortunately, there are still a few players at the position who should be ready to step in and <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-6-rookies-with-the-most-fantasy-potential-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">make an impact in 2016</a>, so the question is, who should be on your fantasy football radar? Let's take a look at the top rookie running backs and how they will likely rank in terms of production in 2016.
<h2>6. Jordan Howard, Chicago Bears (fifth round)</h2>
We considered keeping this list at just five players, but couldn't justify leaving Howard off it. Since Chicago let Matt Forte leave, there have been rumblings that the Bears weren't completely sold on Jeremy Langford as their featured back. And this is where Howard comes into play.

It was pretty surprising to see him fall all the way to the fifth round, as Howard, a transfer from UAB to Indiana, totaled 1,213 yards and nine touchdowns in 2015, an impressive 6.2 yards per carry. He will be a major playmaker in this league, and while he'll likely remain behind Langford for much of this season, don't be shocked to see him slowly take away touches as the year rolls on.
<h2>5. Derrick Henry, Tennessee Titans (second round)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_595059" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-595059" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Derrick-Henry_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL: Predicting the Most Productive Rookie RBs in 2016" width="757" height="504" /> Derrick Henry of the Tennessee Titans | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

If the draft happened just a few months earlier, Derrick Henry would probably be No. 2 on this list. Instead, he'll sit behind former Philadelphia Eagles running back DeMarco Murray. The Titans acquired Murray this offseason, and there's little doubt that he'll be their featured back in 2016. Unfortunately, this means that the man who rushed for 2,219 yards and a ridiculous 28 touchdowns last season for Alabama will get sporadic touches.

There is reason to believe that the Titans will try to bring him along as the season goes on and get him more and more involved, so it wouldn't be shocking to see Murray's role wind up being less massive than everyone expects it to be. One way or another, it's hard to ignore the fact that Henry's situation would have been much better had the team not traded for Murray.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. C.J. Prosise, Seattle Seahawks (third round)</h2>
While it was surprising to see C.J. Prosise go above a few other running backs in the draft, there's no question that he landed in a great spot. He'll play alongside Thomas Rawls now that Marshawn Lynch has called it a career. While Rawls had an impressive season in 2015, the Seahawks will look to utilize the rookie to help ease the pressure off him this coming year.

Prosise is an interesting story, as he switched from wide receiver to running back in 2015, and averaged 6.6 yards per carry with 1,029 rushing yards and 11 scores. It's obvious that the Seahawks see Prosise as a player who can catch the ball out of the backfield, while changing the game on the ground as well.

Expect Seattle to ease Prosise in, and don't be shocked if he's not an immediate playmaker from day one. However, after a few weeks, he should wind up being a major game changer.
<h2>3. Kenyan Drake, Miami Dolphins (third round)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_637832" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-637832" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Derrick-Henry-and-Kenyan-Drake-Alabama-640x427.jpg" alt="Derrick Henry of the Alabama Crimson Tide celebrates with teammate Kenyan Drake after scoring a 50-yard touchdown against the Clemson Tigers during the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship Game at University of Phoenix Stadium on January 11, 2016 in Glendale, Arizona.

Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

There's good news and bad news for Kenyan Drake. The good news is that he landed a great spot in Miami, a team that just lost Lamar Miller and will likely rely heavily on Jay Ajayi. This means Drake should get plenty of action early. The bad news is that he could have been drafted higher than the third round had he not been stuck behind Henry at Alabama.

Drake received just 77 carries last year, totaling 408 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 29 passes for 276 yards and an additional score. He has game-changing speed and should be an excellent weapon out of the backfield for Ryan Tannehill. Don't be shocked if Drake is able to force his way into a 50-50 split with Ajayi.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Devontae Booker, Denver Broncos (fourth round)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_572633" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-572633" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Devontae-Booker-Arizona-State-v-Utah-DOX8Xlc9SSVl.jpg" alt="NFL: Predicting the Most Productive Rookie RBs in 2016" width="757" height="459" /> Devontae Booker, drafted by the Denver Broncos | Gene Sweeney Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

Devontae Booker was a complete and total steal by the Broncos in this draft. The fact that he wound up falling to the fourth round is incredible. It wouldn't have shocked us to see Booker get drafted soon after Henry, but instead he landed on a Broncos team where he'll be able to push for immediate work.

It really wouldn't be surprising in the slightest to see him actually take over in this backfield and become the go-to option. He's a threat both on the ground and through the air, and over his two seasons with Utah, he totaled 2,773 rushing yards, averaged five yards per carry, scored 21 touchdowns, and caught 80 passes for 622 yards.

Booker's game is the real deal, and Broncos fans will love the fact that they landed him, yet alone that it happened in the middle rounds of the draft.
<h2>1. Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys (first round)</h2>
Ezekiel Elliott is the type of talent who doesn't come around at running back every year. He's the definition of a complete back, as he can not only be a force running the ball, but he can also catch passes and most importantly, he can block. The Cowboys need to keep Tony Romo healthy, and they now landed a stellar pass-blocking running back in Elliott, which means it will be hard for Dallas to justify keeping him off the field for too long.

The man who topped 1,800 yards rushing and scored 41 touchdowns the past two seasons already has the heart of fans of the Dallas Cowboys, but just wait until you see him play. Elliott is a difference-maker in every way you can imagine. He'll be the top producing rookie in 2016, and will also take down the Offensive Rookie of the Year award as well.

		<description><![CDATA[It takes talent and guts; here's a look at the best college quarterbacks who decided to try their hand at being NFL wide receivers.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_831491" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831491 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Braxton-Miller-Jamie-Sabau-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best College Quarterbacks Turned NFL Wide Receivers" width="757" height="503" /> Jamie Sabau/Getty Images[/caption]

When Braxton Miller decided that he would <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/braxton-miller-position-change-was-it-the-right-or-wrong-move.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">play wide receiver for Ohio State</a> in 2015, it came as a surprise, but not entirely. The Buckeyes had a log jam behind center with three quarterbacks on the roster who all could be All-Americans if given the chance to start. So when Miller, who threw for more than 2,000 yards passing as a sophomore and a junior, chose to become a wide receiver, he wasn’t the first player to ever do so. Athletic quarterbacks such as himself have been doing this for years in order to make it to the National Football League.

While there are still plenty of pro-style quarterbacks at the collegiate level, as college football has evolved into more and more teams implementing some sort of spread, fast-pace offense, it seems that there are less pro-ready quarterbacks entering the draft each year. However, many of those players—spread offense quarterbacks, for example, who succeed in college not because of their arm strength but because they’re the most dangerous player on the field as long as the ball’s in their hand—have found a spot for themselves on an NFL team. Just not as a quarterback.

When a player has athleticism that many others (quarterbacks or not) don’t have, they have worth in the NFL. Whether they’re returning kicks, playing in the backfield, or catching passes as a receiver, if they’re good enough, a team will be smart enough to find them a spot on the field. But going from college quarterback to professional wide receiver can’t be easy.

Sure, you have the mindset and know what you look for in receivers, but running routes and catching hard-thrown balls isn’t something a player just picks up on the fly. And that’s why it’s all the more impressive when a successful college quarterback converts into an equally successful professional wide receiver. Whether or not Miller will succeed remains to be seen. But until then, here are the five best quarterbacks who successfully converted into NFL wide receivers.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Hines Ward</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831493" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831493 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hines-Ward-Grant-Halverson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best College Quarterbacks Turned NFL Wide Receivers" width="757" height="568" /> Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

Ward was never a full-time starting quarterback at Georgia, but he had his moments. Ward earned the starting job in the Bulldogs’ bowl game, the Peach Bowl, during his sophomore season and went on to throw for a record-setting 413 yards. But when Pittsburgh drafted him, his quarterbacking days ended as quickly as they started.

During his 14-year career with the Steelers, though, he amassed 1,000 receptions and 12,083 yards—both of which are franchise records. Furthermore, he helped the Steelers to two different Super Bowl titles (2005 and 2008). When the Steelers defeated the Seahawks in Super Bowl XL, Ward earned the game’s MVP honors due to his five catches, 123 yards and one touchdown—which just so happened to come from another quarterback turned receiver, Antwaan Randle El.
<h2>2. Josh Cribbs</h2>
Cribbs went undrafted in 2005 following a successful tenure at Kent State. Upon finishing his career, he left the Golden Flashes as the school’s all-time offensive leader with 10,893 yards and also all-time passer with 7,169 yards. But his style of play at Kent State—run and pass with ease—and the lack of elite competition he saw, resulted in scouts not believing he’d be a successful NFL quarterback.

Though Cribbs didn’t amount to a prolific wide receiver—he tallied just a little more than 1,000 total career receiving yards—he was by far one of the league’s, if not the most, best punt and kick returners. During his time as the Browns return man, Cribbs made two Pro Bowls and also two All-Pro teams. He also holds the league record for total kick returns for touchdowns with eight in his career.

Sure, Devin Hester might have been a better overall return man (evidenced by his 14 career punt returns for touchdowns), but Cribbs always seemed to make it happen mid-kickoff return.<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 3. Julian Edelman</h2>
[caption id="attachment_831506" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831506" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Julian-Edelman-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="The 5 Best College Quarterbacks Turned NFL Wide Receivers" width="757" height="519" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

Similar to Cribbs, Edelman also played quarterback for Kent State. And also similar to Cribbs—albeit not as prolific—Edelman excelled under the Golden Flashes’ offensive system. But his skills and attributes have allowed him to excel more so than Cribbs as a receiver. Yes, it helps that he’s had Tom Brady throwing him the ball.

But following a slow professional start and the fact that he was a seventh-round draft pick, Edelman has found his niche in New England’s offense. In the last two seasons he has 197 receptions, 2,028 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. At 29 years old, Edelman’s stock is on the rise, and despite his smaller six-foot frame, his trustworthy hands and no-fear mentality have made him Mr.Reliable for Brady in the slot.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Antwaan Randle El</h2>
Despite playing for an Indiana team that was never atop the Big Ten standings from 1998-2002, Randle El was one of the conference’s best college quarterbacks. However, the Steelers drafted him in 2002 and immediately moved him to receiver, very similar to what they had done with Ward years before.

While he was never the go-to guy, he had four successful seasons in Pittsburgh and also played an important role in the team’s Super Bowl Championship in 2005. When Randle El went to the Washington Redskins in 2006, he played the same kind of role he had in Pittsburgh: mostly in the slot and returned some kicks and punts. But both the Redskins and Steelers utilized his ability on reverse, wide receiver passes.

Randle El finished his career 22 for 27 on passing attempts—all as a receiver—323 yards, and six touchdowns. By far his best moment, though, came in his 43-yard touchdown pass in the Super Bowl during a reverse pass. After all, the Steelers did love the trick play that year.
<h2>5. Gene Washington</h2>
By far the oldest player on this list, Washington played quarterback at Stanford and was later drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 1969 NFL draft. Though San Francisco took him as a quarterback, he was quickly converted into receiver.

But he flourished at wide receiver, making the Pro Bowl in each of his first four seasons, and also leading the NFL in receiving in 1970 with 1,100 yards. In an era where the passing game was nowhere as prevalent as it is today, Washington was well ahead of the curve in terms of best college quarterbacks turned NFL wide receivers.

		<description><![CDATA[NFL trade rumors involve a ton of speculation. Regardless, these 5 big-name players will most likely be traded in the coming months.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-worst-nfl-trades-ever.html/" target="_blank">Blockbuster trades</a> helped shape the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> into the billion-dollar empire we know today. While we typically don’t see the same number of trades in the NFL as we do in other pro sports leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, or MLB, there will undoubtedly be at least two or three trades -- and many NFL trade rumors -- each year; ones that mold the landscape of the league.

Some trades, such as the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/what-jimmy-graham-means-for-the-seattle-seahawks.html/" target="_blank">Jimmy Graham trade</a> in 2015, seem to come out of nowhere, whereas others become public knowledge well before they are officially executed. With the 2016 regular season rapidly, here is a look at five players who are most likely to be traded in the coming months.
<h2>1. Colin Kaepernick, QB, San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_621228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-621228" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Colin-Kaepernick_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="NFL Trade Rumors: 5 Big-Name Players Most Likely to Change Teams" width="757" height="504" /> It's a nearly forgone conclusion that Colin Kaepernick's time with the San Francisco 49ers will soon come to an end. | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

In our eyes, the 2016 season will be Colin Kaepernick’s last season with the 49ers -- if he’s not traded before. The team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-money-derail-colin-kaepernicks-trade-to-the-denver-broncos.html/" target="_blank">came incredibly close</a> to sending the former second-round pick to the Denver Broncos this offseason, and now reports are surfacing that <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfl/rumors/post/_/id/30211/nfl-rumor-central-blaine-gabbert-heavy-favorite-over-colin-kaepernick" target="_blank">Blaine Gabbert is the heavy favorite</a> to be the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">Niners’ starting quarterback</a> when the regular season opens in September.

The one factor that could hinder Kaepernick’s trade value during the season is his $15.27 million salary-cap hit. If the 49ers cannot find a trade partner, or if the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder cannot improve his trade value, there is a real chance that San Francisco will release him before his 2017 salary becomes guaranteed on April 1, 2017.

Of course, it would help if Kaepernick were willing to restructure his current contract. But as we learned during the trade saga with the Broncos, this seems incredibly unlikely. Still, there are likely multiple teams <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-4-teams-desperate-enough-to-sign-colin-kaepernick.html/" target="_blank">desperate enough</a> for help at the quarterback position to take on Kaepernick’s contract as is.

<h2>2. Joe Thomas, OT, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661205" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661205" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joe-Thomas_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-640x429.jpg" alt="NFL Trade Rumors: 5 Big-Name Players Most Likely to Change Teams" width="757" height="507" /> Joe Thomas is too good to waste his talents playing for the Cleveland Browns. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

The Browns came close to <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/report-broncos-offered-browns-first-round-pick-for-joe-thomas/" target="_blank">sending Joe Thomas to the Denver Broncos</a> during the middle of the 2015 season, but their asking price proved to be too high for Denver’s liking and they held onto the eight-time All-Pro for another season. Looking ahead, it seems like the 6-foot-6, 312-pounder still has enough gas left in his tank to be dominant for at least four or five more seasons.

We believe his time in Cleveland will soon come to an end. It’s obvious that the Browns are currently in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-lose-every-game-season.html/" target="_blank">full-fledged rebuild mode</a>, which is something Thomas must be sick of by now. In his nine-year NFL career, the future Hall of Famer has yet to play in a postseason game; if he stays in Cleveland, he <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-with-trouble-on-defense.html/" target="_blank">likely never will</a>.

As for the Browns, it makes total sense to move Thomas while his value is high in order to continue stockpiling draft picks and young talent. With that being the case, don’t be surprised if Thomas is traded to a Super Bowl contender before the trade deadline this fall.

<h2>3. Mike Glennon, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661207" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661207" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mike-Glennon_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images-1-640x474.jpg" alt="NFL Trade Rumors: 5 Big-Name Players Most Likely to Change Teams" width="757" height="561" /> Mike Glennon is buried behind Jameis Winston on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' depth chart. | Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, Mike Glennon will never be the full-time starting quarterback in Tampa Bay unless Jameis Winston’s career somehow completely implodes. In his 18 career starts, Glennon has posted decent numbers and has shown flashes of having the skillset to be a successful starter in the NFL -- which has made him attractive to several teams on the trade market. The Dallas Cowboys <a href="http://www.bucsnation.com/2016/6/6/11866126/nfl-trade-rumors-mike-glennon-to-cowboys-rumors-surface-again" target="_blank">continue to be rumored</a> as a potential trade destination Glennon, but we can think of at least five other teams that would <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/tampa-bay-buccaneers/post/_/id/13151/despite-trade-speculation-backup-qb-mike-glennon-remains-in-tampa" target="_blank">likely be interested</a> if the Bucs made him available. For Tampa Bay, it makes sense to move Glennon while they still can since it’s a virtual guarantee that he will sign with a team that will give him the opportunity to start when his rookie contract expires in two years.

<h2>4. Jimmy Graham, TE, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661211" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661211" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jimmy-Graham_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-2-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL Trade Rumors: 5 Big-Name Players Most Likely to Change Teams" width="757" height="505" /> Jimmy Graham isn't a great fit in the Seattle Seahawks' offense. | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

The Seahawks completely shook up the NFL last offseason when they acquired Jimmy Graham in a trade with the New Orleans Saints. On paper, the move looked brilliant, but after a full year to reflect on the trade, it appears as though the two-time All-Pro tight end just <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-are-the-seattle-seahawks-regretting-trading-for-jimmy-graham.html/" target="_blank">isn’t a great fit in Seattle’s offense</a>.

Graham has never been a great blocker, and the Seahawks’ run-first, ball-controlling offense simply isn’t conducive to his skill set. While the Seahawks may want to give it more time with Graham, we could totally see them moving him for the right price.

<h2>5. Nick Foles, QB, Los Angeles Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_661212" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-661212" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Nick-Foles_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL Trade Rumors: 5 Big-Name Players Most Likely to Change Teams" width="757" height="505" /> Nick Foles is now expendable after the Los Angeles Rams selected Jared Goff with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

This kind of goes without saying, but Nick Foles is now expendable in Los Angeles after the Rams made the decision to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-breaking-down-the-fallout-from-the-rams-titans-trade.html/" target="_blank">mortgage their future</a> to trade up and select former Cal quarterback Jared Goff with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.

We fully expect there to be plenty of trade interest in Foles around the league, but there is also a chance the Rams will want to hold onto the 27-year-old quarterback for one more season as an insurance policy in the event that Goff is not ready to play from day one.

		<description><![CDATA[It was a rough year in the NFC East in 2015. Will the Washington Redskins repeat as NFC East champions in 2016? Here are our preseason NFC East predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[NFL Training camp always reminds us that it's almost time for the official football season. Fans start to scan through their <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-10-must-watch-games-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">team's schedules</a> and prepare for the upcoming season. So, with OTAs now officially in the books and training camps coming up, it's time to make some predictions concerning each division.

We'll kick things off with the always-interesting NFC East, which featured a division winner with a 9-7 record in the Washington Redskins last season. Let's start with the NFC East predictions concerning where each team will land, and then evaluate each on a team-by-team basis.
<ol>
 	<li>Dallas Cowboys</li>
 	<li>Washington Redskins</li>
 	<li>New York Giants</li>
 	<li>Philadelphia Eagles</li>
</ol>
<h2>Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_617080" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-617080" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Dallas-Cowboys_Ronald-Martinez_Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC East Predictions" width="757" height="505" /> The Dallas Cowboys offense huddles during play in 2015. | Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

The team that finished last in the division at 4-12 will <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-with-the-most-favorable-schedules-next-season.html/" target="_blank">make an impressive turnaround</a> and take the crown in 2016. To put it simply, the Cowboys were surprisingly not bad defensively last year, and as we all know, they played almost the entire year without Tony Romo.

When Romo was out with two collarbone injuries, the team managed just a 1-11 record, and couldn't really generate anything resembling a mediocre offense. This year, they'll have a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-players-bounce-back-injury-2016.html/" target="_blank">healthy Romo</a>, a healthy Dez Bryant, veteran Jason Witten, and of course the No. 4 overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Ezekiel Elliott.

The Cowboys offense <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-3-bold-predictions-for-the-dallas-cowboys-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">will be loaded</a>, but here's a fun fact. Dallas' defense in 2015 allowed the fewest points (374) in the NFC East, just ahead of the Redskins (379). If their defense is able to have that same type of production in 2016, the offense will do more than enough to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-start-season.html/" target="_blank">make the Cowboys a playoff team</a> and division winner once again.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Washington Redskins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_617080" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-617080" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jordan-Reed-Washington-Redskins.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC East Predictions" width="757" height="505" /> DeSean Jackson (L) and Jordan Reed of the Washington Redskins | Mitchell Leff/Getty Images[/caption]

While the Redskins weren't amazing last year, they were the team that decided to grab hold of what was a really, really bad NFC East. Kudos to them, but with at least two of the other three teams in the division improving and getting healthy this season, Washington's path to back-to-back division titles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/mistakes-washington-redskins-cant-repeat.html/" target="_blank">will be brutal</a>.

We think Washington is strong enough to possibly grab a wild card spot, but they won't be able to keep the Cowboys from grabbing the top spot. Kirk Cousins broke out nicely last year for Washington, tossing 29 touchdowns against 11 interceptions, but he's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-worst-taste-quarterbacks.html/" target="_blank">still an unknown</a>. Can he repeat that performance, or will he take a step back?

While Washington has a talented group of pass-catchers, they decided to put all their money on running back Matt Jones to take over the backfield -- after letting Alfred Morris leave town. The Redskins will be a solid team, but not a division winner in 2016.

<h2>New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_594412" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-594412" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eli-Manning-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images-640x425.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC East Predictions" width="757" height="503" /> New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-greatest-new-york-giants-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">G-Men</a> are back on the brink of the postseason. While the NFC East won't produce three playoff teams in 2016, the Giants will finish right around the .500 mark, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-that-won-during-free-agency.html/" target="_blank">improving from their 6-10 record</a> last season. Eli Manning is sporadic at times, but he had a solid 2015 campaign, throwing for 35 touchdowns against 14 interceptions.

The <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-best-offensive-weapons-in-the-nfc-east.html/" target="_blank">real star of the show</a> in New York is Odell Beckham Jr. But is their offensive talent enough to get them over the hump? We love the addition of Sterling Shepard out of Oklahoma during the 2016 NFL Draft, and while the offense should be strong, there are obvious reasons to be concerned about the defensive unit.

The Giants' defense gave up the third-most points in the NFL per game last season at 27.6, and we don't really see this changing. Expect Manning and Beckham to have no issues connecting, but the team will lose a few shootouts in 2016.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_580487" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-580487" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sam-Bradford-Alex-GoodlettGetty-Images-640x442.jpg" alt="NFL: Preseason NFC East Predictions" width="757" height="523" /> Quarterback Sam Bradford of the Philadelphia Eagles | Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

There's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-predictions-philadelphia-eagles-2016.html/" target="_blank">good news and bad news</a> for the Eagles. The good news is that they seem to have a pretty bright future in quarterback Carson Wentz. The bad news is that it looks like they're set to roll out the red carpet for another season with Sam Bradford.

While the Eagles have no interest in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/predicting-rookie-qbs-will-produce-2016.html/" target="_blank">pushing Wentz onto the field</a> before he's ready -- the right move -- Bradford isn't the answer at the position. Chase Daniel may actually be a better option in 2016, but overall, it will be interesting to see how Philadelphia's offense looks this season.

New head coach Doug Pederson did a superb job with the Kansas City Chiefs' offense, specifically their running game. We should expect to see a lot of Ryan Mathews this season.

Regardless, the NFC East as a whole has improved. We don't believe the Eagles have done enough this offseason to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-never-win-super-bowl.html/" target="_blank">do much better than 2015</a>. Expect somewhere around a 6-10 or 7-9 finish for Philadelphia, with Wentz getting some playing time later in the year.

		<description><![CDATA[Todd Gurley was a top-five fantasy football running back in 2015. Can he be even better in 2016?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_913862" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-913862" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Todd-Gurley_Dilip-Vishwanat_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Todd Gurley" width="757" height="549" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

Todd Gurley burst onto the NFL scene in a big way in 2015, even though it took a few games to get his health to the point where he was ready to take over in the backfield for the St. Louis Rams. Once he did, though, there was no turning back for the rookie running back. Gurley was so good in 2015 that he went down as one of the <a title="best running backs" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-best-running-backs-of-the-2015-season.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">best running backs</a> in the league.

In 2016, he’ll look even better and leave a lasting impression after his sophomore campaign. Now, when looking back at 2015 from a fantasy football perspective, Gurley managed to finish in the top five in ESPN standard scoring:
<ol>
 	<li>Devonta Freeman: 230 points</li>
 	<li>Adrian Peterson: 217 points</li>
 	<li>Doug Martin: 187 points</li>
 	<li>DeAngelo Williams: 179 points</li>
 	<li>Todd Gurley: 176 points</li>
 	<li>Lamar Miller: 173 points</li>
 	<li>David Johnson: 164 points</li>
</ol>
As you can see, Gurley was next to some impressive company and did it all while playing in just 13 games. The same can actually be said about Freeman, Williams, and Johnson though, as none of those three players were full-time starters for their teams. While that’s a pretty impressive list, the question is, what should we expect fantasy football-wise from Gurley in 2016? Better yet, can Gurley work his way up that list and finish as one of the top two fantasy running backs?<!--nextpage-->
<h2>The good news and bad news for Gurley</h2>
[caption id="attachment_868225" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-868225" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Todd-Gurley-St-Louis-Rams-v-Arizona-Cardinals-qRqrdMjLezbl.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Todd Gurley" width="757" height="505" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

For Gurley, it won’t be as easy to be massively successful in 2016 as it will be for a few other names on the list above. For a hypothetical situation, we’ll assume that all of those running backs remain on the same teams they were on in 2015. In that case, any NFL fan would probably take any other starting quarterback over whoever will likely start for the Los Angeles Rams next year.

That’s the bad news, because the lack of a strong passing attack will make life just a bit tougher for the second-year running back in Los Angeles. As for the good news? Well, with the lack of strong quarterback play, it’s pretty obvious that the Rams will give the ball to Gurley as often as he can possibly take it.

Through 13 games last season we saw Gurley tally 229 carries for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns. He topped 19 carries eight times, while falling below nine carries just one time (in his first game played). Gurley will obviously be the focal point of the Rams offense next season, but it would still be nice for the Rams to find a solid passing game to help ease the pressure off him. Only time will tell, but he should still be in for a huge fantasy season, and he will be one of the first running backs drafted.
<h2>Consensus</h2>
[caption id="attachment_847108" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-847108" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Todd-Gurley-St-Louis-Rams-v-Oakland-Raiders-XU5zD6W5qw8l.jpg" alt="2016 Fantasy Football Projections: Todd Gurley" width="757" height="505" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

It will be tough sledding at times for Gurley, but that doesn’t change the fact that he will be the definition of a workhorse running back in Los Angeles this coming season. The Rams love him, the fans will love him, and fantasy owners will be ecstatic with what he’ll be able to bring to their teams in 2016. Based on ESPN scoring, we believe the top five running backs in 2016 fantasy football will be:
<ol>
 	<li>Le’Veon Bell</li>
 	<li>Todd Gurley</li>
 	<li>David Johnson</li>
 	<li>Devonta Freeman</li>
 	<li>Adrian Peterson</li>
</ol>
It’s an interesting mix, as Bell, Johnson, and Freeman are all stellar pass-catching backs, while Gurley and Peterson are really the ground-and-pound type of backs. Regardless, as we saw in 2015, there’s more than enough potential for both types of running back to excel. Gurley will bump up from the No. 5 spot to No. 2, and will finish with somewhere around 1,300-1,400 yards with 13-15 touchdowns rushing. The only reason he won’t take the top spot is due to Bell’s exceptional ability in the passing game.

		<description><![CDATA[The NFL has plenty of talented, high-performing running backs, but which 5 will have the best 2016 seasons statistically?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the NFL quickly becoming a pass-heavy league, the roles of “elite" running backs seem to be fading, but fortunately that won’t be the case for the five players below in 2016. Not only are these running backs utilized in a big way in their team’s offensive game plan, but the bulk of them can also catch passes out of the backfield as well. Regardless of how the ball gets into their hands, they are each capable of doing huge things when it does. While the five names below are all poised for huge seasons, you’ll also notice one or two names who flew a little under the radar by not making this list. Let’s kick it off with a player who’ll be stepping into the spotlight for a full-time starting gig.
<h2>5. Thomas Rawls, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_865231" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-865231 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Thomas-Rawls_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images-e1454710457181.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Running Backs Who Will Have the Best 2016 Seasons" width="757" height="505" /> Thomas Rawls of the Seattle Seahawks | Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

While Rawls started his fair share of games last season, he didn’t get the full year as the No. 1 guy in Seattle, as Marshawn Lynch was still playing and Rawls suffered his own injury late in the year. With that being said, we still got to see Rawls tally double-digit carries six times, and finish the season up with 147 carries for 830 yards and four touchdowns. He wasn’t a massive part of the passing attack, catching just nine balls for 76 yards and a score, but he proved he can do it when called upon. Either way, Rawls is poised to be one of the more dangerous and intriguing running backs in 2016.

<h2>4. David Johnson, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_855477" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-855477 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/David-Johnson_Norm-Hall_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Running Backs Who Will Have the Best 2016 Seasons" width="757" height="670" /> David Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals | Norm Hall/Getty Images[/caption]

Johnson gets the nod over Rawls for one reason. His ability to catch passes out of the backfield is stellar, and his playmaking potential as a receiver bumps him just a bit above Rawls. Johnson was also in a situation in 2015 where he wasn’t the featured back for the bulk of the season, and only saw double-digit carries in four games. Regardless, Johnson still finished up the year with 581 rushing yards, 457 receiving yards, and 12 combined touchdowns. He has massive upside, and in an offense where Carson Palmer and Arizona’s talented group of wide receivers will help to ease the pressure, expect Johnson to have a huge 2016 season.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Le’Veon Bell, Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_658671" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-658671" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LeVeon-Bell_Justin-K.-Aller_Getty-Images-1-640x429.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Running Backs Who Will Have the Best 2016 Seasons" width="757" height="508" /> Le’Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers | Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

While it’s actually pretty bold to predict Bell as a top-three running back after the brutal knee injury he suffered in 2015, we’ve seen quite a few running backs bounce back in a big way after injuries. For Bell, we expect a big 2016 season. Bell played in just six games last season, but still managed 556 rushing yards, 136 receiving yards, and three touchdowns. His yard-per-carry average was 4.9, proving that he can shred through defenses without much of an issue at all. Bell is one of the most well-rounded backs in the NFL as well, and his 2014 season proves that, as he had over 2,000 combined rushing and receiving yards, with 11 total touchdowns.

<h2>2. Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
[caption id="attachment_893885" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-893885" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Adrian-Peterson_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Running Backs Who Will Have the Best 2016 Seasons" width="757" height="513" /> Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

Yes, we’re predicting “All Day" to finish in the No. 2 spot this season. While Peterson led the league in rushing yards last season with 1,485 while scoring 11 touchdowns, we expect the man at No. 1 on this list to give him a run for his money and actually take down the rushing title. Peterson will still have a massive year, and as he’s done every year that he’s played (except for 2014, when he played one game), he’ll also top the double-digit touchdown mark. Peterson is the man in Minnesota still, and even at the age of 31, next season will continue his incredible career.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Todd Gurley, Los Angeles Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_589211" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-589211" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Todd-Gurley_Dilip-Vishwanat_Getty-Images-640x464.jpg" alt="NFL: The 5 Running Backs Who Will Have the Best 2016 Seasons" width="757" height="549" /> Todd Gurley of the Los Angeles Rams | Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

Gurley burst onto the scene in 2015 in a big way, rushing for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns in just 13 games. With Gurley having a full year in the NFL under his belt, as well as being able to play in the full 16 games next season, expect him to light it up in Los Angeles. Gurley will not only win the rushing title next year, but he’ll also score between 13 and 15 touchdowns as well. While we saw a bit of his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield last year (21 receptions for 188 yards), expect to see a little more of that also. Gurley will be utilized in every way possible in this offense, and at times he may wind up just putting the Rams on his back.

		<description><![CDATA[The Philadelphia Eagles had a rough 2015 season. Will it improve in 2016 under new head coach Doug Pederson? It's time to get bold with 3 predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_611814" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611814" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Eagles-Mitchell-Leff-Getty-Images-640x443.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016" width="757" height="523" /> Darren Sproles of the Philadelphia Eagles celebrates his touchdown with teammate Lane Johnson (L) and Zach Ertz against the Buffalo Bills in 2015. | Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images[/caption]

The Philadelphia Eagles have been one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/6-nfl-teams-that-have-choked-away-the-most-wins-in-nfl-history.html/" target="_blank">more successful teams</a> in terms of their win-loss record over the past 15 years. Since 2000, the team has fallen below the .500 mark just three times, with the most recent coming in 2015 as they finished 7-9 overall. While the Eagles <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-how-the-eagles-have-dominated-the-offseason.html/" target="_blank">haven't been bad</a> by a long shot, they also haven't found much playoff success.

Over that 15-year span, the Eagles made just one Super Bowl, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-teams-never-win-super-bowl.html/" target="_blank">losing back in 2004</a>. The start of the 2016 season marks a new era for the Eagles though, as they threw in the towel <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-worst-decisions-chip-kelly-made-with-the-eagles.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">on Chip Kelly</a>, and turned things over to former Kansas City Chief's offensive coordinator Doug Pederson.

Things <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-coaches-everyone-will-be-watching.html/" target="_blank">weren't always great for Kelly</a>, but as their head coach, he managed to lead them to a 27-21 record, with a finish no worse than second in the NFC East. So, with Pederson now running the show in Philly, and a strange quarterback situation in the making, what will the upcoming season look like? Let's get bold with three predictions about the Philadelphia Eagles' 2016 season.
<h2>1. Ryan Mathews hits double-digit rushing touchdowns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_611814" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611814" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ryan-Mathews-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016" width="757" height="523" /> Ryan Mathews of the Philadelphia Eagles is tackled by Ndamukong Suh of the Miami Dolphins in 2015. | Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

In Kansas City, one thing Pederson had no issue with was getting the most out of his running backs. With DeMarco Murray now long gone in Tennessee, it will be Ryan Mathews' <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-7-best-offensive-weapons-in-the-nfc-east.html/" target="_blank">chance to shine</a> this season.

The running back is coming off a season in which he was surprisingly productive, but hardly received the ball. Mathews totaled just 106 carries for 539 yards (5.1 yards-per-carry) with six touchdowns. He caught 20 passes for 146 yards and an additional score as well.

With Pederson's strong track record with running backs, as well as the uncertainty at the quarterback position, expect Mathews be heavily involved in the offense this season. We're talking 1,000-plus yards, probably somewhere around 1,200, as well as topping double-digit touchdowns for the first time in his NFL career.

To this point, Mathews' best season came in 2013 with the San Diego Chargers, when he ran the ball 285 times for 1,255 yards and six scores.

<h2>2. Philadelphia finishes fourth in the NFC East</h2>
[caption id="attachment_564517" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-564517 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sam-Bradford-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016" width="757" height="564" /> Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Since 2000, the Eagles have finished fourth in the division three times; one of those times they did it with an 8-8 record (2007). This year, it will happen once again, but it won't be with an 8-8 record. A new coach is nice and all, but there is still a massive amount of questions for this team.

Yes, they have quite a bit of defensive talent, but they also allowed 430 points last season. As for the offensive side of things, it's either Sam Bradford, Chase Daniel, or <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-why-the-eagles-were-smart-to-trade-for-no-2.html/" target="_blank">Carson Wentz</a> running the show. To be honest, none of these quarterbacks really get anyone too excited about the passing game.

Wentz has a bright future in this league, but it will take him time to adjust. Bradford is in a situation where he's <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/biggest-nfl-offseason-mistakes.html/" target="_blank">never really done anything</a> to warrant being considered a franchise quarterback, which is obvious. Daniel is a real unknown, but actually might be the best option.

Regardless, the Eagles can't run the ball all game, and with the improvements in the NFC East, including the Washington Redskins improving, there's a real possibility that this team <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-teams-we-expect-to-see-fail-in-2016.html/" target="_blank">finds itself in last place</a> in the division.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Sam Bradford gets benched, but it's for Chase Daniel</h2>
[caption id="attachment_611814" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-611814" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ChaseDaniel.jpg" alt="NFL: 3 Bold Predictions for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2016" width="757" height="523" /> Quarterback Chase Daniel, formerly of the Kansas City Chiefs, now with the Philadelphia Eagles | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

There's good news and bad news for Bradford and the Eagles. The good news is that they start off with games against the Cleveland Browns and Chicago Bears. The bad news? They start off against the Browns and Bears.

If Bradford struggles against those two teams and can't get the Eagles two wins early, it will spell trouble. Their third game is against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and then comes that dreaded early-season bye week. Now, this is where it gets interesting.

Imagine if the Eagles are 1-2 going into the bye week; Bradford has played poorly, but the team doesn't believe that Wentz is <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nfl-drafts-biggest-winners-and-losers.html/" target="_blank">ready for in-game action</a>. Fortunately, that's why they handed Daniel a three-year, $21 million deal. He may not be the long-term answer, but this is a way for the Eagles to avoid having to throw Wentz into the mix too early, while also pleasing the fans (to an extent).

Now, if Daniel gets in and struggles, then Pederson will face a real fun situation, as Philly will clamor for the rookie quarterback from North Dakota State at that point. Overall, we see this being an interesting, and potentially tough year for the Eagles.

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2014, Michael Vick became the first NFL quarterback to rush for 6,000 career yards. What other big names join Vick on the all-time QB rushing yards list?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_474434" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/07/Michael-Vick-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-474434 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Michael-Vick-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Michael-Vick-Rich-Schultz-Getty-Images.jpg" width="757" height="511" /></a> Rich Schultz/Getty Images[/caption]

It might feel like a distant memory now, but the Week Ten New York Jets-Pittsburgh Steelers game from 2014 will go down in history for at least two reasons. First of all, the Jets won, hanging on to beat the Steelers 20-13 after recovering a late onside kick, snapping an eight loss skid for Rex Ryan's crew. Second, and perhaps slightly more memorable in the NFL record books, was that New York’s Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for 6,000 yards in a career.

The NFL veteran has consistently been able to move the pigskin both with his feet and his arm, averaging more than seven yards per rush whenever he carries the ball. Vick’s exploits on the ground include a 1,000-yard season <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2707909" target="_blank">with the Falcons</a> in 2006, the first ever by a quarterback. And while the Virginia Tech product has sat alone for several years on top of the all-time “most career rushing yards by a QB” list, the recent 6,000-yard milestone seems like a good time to open up the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_career.htm" target="_blank">record books</a> and see what other <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/21/vick-isnt-the-first-rushing-quarterback-but-he-is-the-best-for-now/" target="_blank">big-name signal-callers</a> from years gone by join Vick as the best rushing quarterbacks pro football has <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/gallery?id=5208880" target="_blank">ever seen</a>.

Here, then, are the top seven rushing quarterbacks in NFL history, based on career yardage totals.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>7. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_506823" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-506823 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" width="756" height="565" /></a> Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

In 16 years under center with the Denver Broncos, Hall of Famer John Elway rushed for a total of 3,407 yards, even though he never had more than 304 yards in a season. Elway, who started at least 11 games in every season he played, averaged 4.4 yards per rushing attempt and scored 33 touchdowns for the Broncos. Still, his biggest plays came with his arm: Elway’s career-long run went for just 31 yards.
<h2>6. Donovan McNabb</h2>
The Eagles have been fortunate enough to employ quite a few talented runners at quarterback in recent history, including longtime star Donovan McNabb (pictured). Of McNabb’s 3,459 career rushing yards, 3,249 came in a Philadelphia uniform. McNabb retired with a career rushing average of 5.6 yards per carry and 29 rushing scores to his credit.
<h2>5. Steve McNair</h2>
Over 13 years, first with the Oilers/Titans and later with the Ravens, quarterback Steve McNair consistently made big plays on the ground to help his team win. McNair carried the ball into the end zone 37 times, including a career-long 71-yard scoring run against the Buccaneers in 1998. McNair rolled up 3,590 rushing yards over his career on an average of 5.4 yards per carry.
<h2>4. Fran Tarkenton</h2>
Fran Tarkenton played 18 NFL seasons in all during the ’60s and ’70s with the Vikings, Giants, and then Vikings again. Tarkenton amassed 3,674 rushing yards over that span, averaging 5.4 yards per rush. Perhaps more amazingly, Tarkenton reached that total without ever putting together a 400-yard season. He finished his career with 32 rushing touchdowns, in addition to 342 more through the air.

<h2>3. Steve Young</h2>
49ers legend Steve Young rushed for at least 150 yards in each of his first 14 seasons in the NFL (two with Tampa Bay, then the rest in San Francisco). The <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=252&amp;tab=Championship" target="_blank">Super Bowl XXIX MVP</a> finished his career with 722 carries and 4,239 yards on the ground, scoring 43 touchdowns in the process.
<h2>2. Randall Cunningham</h2>
Randall Cunningham (pictured above) rushed for 4,928 yards over his 16 seasons as an NFL quarterback, which stood as the all-time record until Mr. Vick came along. Cunningham averaged 6.4 yards per carry and found the end zone with his legs 35 times, 32 of those with the Eagles. Best known for his time in Philly, Cunningham finished out his career with stints in Minnesota, Baltimore, and Dallas.
<h2>1. Michael Vick</h2>
Vick rushed for 6,109 yards in his career, more than half of them with the Falcons. He also scored 36 touchdowns on the ground and has at least one run of 20 or more yards in every season he’s played, including a career-best 61-yarder in 2013 with the Eagles.

Nothing causes a stir quite like trying to get people to agree on which <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> team is the best of all time. Not only does everyone seem to have an opinion on the matter, but no one can ever agree on the best method to use for calculating an accurate answer. Of course, it’s always easier to come to a conclusion if you’re willing to look at the problem in a strictly objective matter. And if you ask us, there is no better way to do that than with <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/" target="_blank">Elo ratings</a>.

For those of you who need a little reminder on how these work, the good folks at FiveThirtyEight, who used this methodology in 2014, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nfl-elo-ratings-are-back/" target="_blank">have you covered</a>: “Elo still works exactly the same way it did [in 2014]: Teams gain and lose ground based on the final score of each game and how unexpected the result was in the eyes of the pregame ratings."

This may seem like a complicated method, but the more you look at it, the more it begins to make sense. And because <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/neil-paine/" target="_blank">Neil Paine</a> was kind enough to break it all down, we have a credible process to figure out which <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">teams are the greatest in NFL history</a>.

Here’s how FiveThirtyEight explains it:

“For our master ranking of the best Elo seasons ever, we computed each team’s season-ending Elo and its season-long mean Elo in addition to its peak rating. The teams in the table above are ranked by the column labeled ‘blend,’ which simply takes the average of the three measurements to get a more holistic picture of a team’s quality."

Since we’re all about passing along quality information, and always enjoy creating a lively discussion, we figured it would be best to get the ball rolling by taking a look, according to Elo, at the five best teams in the history of the NFL.

<h2>5. 1989 San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_872032" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/89-49ers-Rick-Stewart-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-872032" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/89-49ers-Rick-Stewart-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="San Francisco 49ers celebrate after a touchdown " width="757" height="505" /></a> Rick Stewart/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Elo blend: 1770</h2>
The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1989.htm" target="_blank">1989 San Francisco 49ers</a> won the organization’s second consecutive Super Bowl, crushing the Denver Broncos in the big game by a score of 55-10. With the great Joe Montana under center, this team finished the regular season with a 14-2 record, was first in the NFL in scoring (27.6 points per game), and was third in the league in points allowed (15.8 points per game). <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">According to FiveThirtyEight</a>, this Niners team would reach a peak Elo rating of 1795, which would also constitute the club’s end-of-the-year mark. However, since San Francisco’s mean Elo would only hit 1720, the ’89 team would have to settle for an Elo blend of 1770, making it the fifth best team in NFL history.

<h2>4. 1998 Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_872039" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Denver-Broncos-TIMOTHY-A.-CLARY-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-872039" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Denver-Broncos-TIMOTHY-A.-CLARY-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="John Elway (C) is carried by teammates after winning the Super Bowl" width="757" height="569" /></a> Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Elo blend: 1771</h2>
Hall of Fame quarterback <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/johnelway/2500547/profile" target="_blank">John Elway</a> was able to ride off into the sunset after winning his second straight Super Bowl with the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/johnelway/2500547/profile" target="_blank">1998 Denver Broncos</a>. Like the No. 5 team on this list, the ’98 Broncos also finished the regular season with a 14-2 record. However, while this group only managed to hit a peak Elo rating of 1784 and finish the year with a mark of 1781, because these Broncos were able to acquire an average mark of 1747, their Elo blend score wound up being just higher — 1771 — than the 1989 San Francisco 49ers’. As a result, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">based on FiveThirtyEight’s calculations</a>, this Denver Broncos team ranks as the fourth best NFL team ever.

<h2>3. 1942 Chicago Bears</h2>
[caption id="attachment_746462" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Chicago-Bears-Helmet.jpg"><img class="wp-image-746462" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Chicago-Bears-Helmet.jpg" alt="Chicago Bears helmet" width="757" height="505" /></a> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Elo blend: 1785</h2>
The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/1942.htm" target="_blank">1942 Chicago Bears</a> are a great example of why using Elo ratings to rank teams is an imperfect system. Although this group finished the regular season with an 11-0 record, led the league in scoring (34.2 points per game), and had the top scoring defense in the NFL — allowing just 7.6 points per contest — it ended up losing to the Washington Redskins in the Championship game. Yet, because the Bears wound up with an <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">Elo blend of 1785</a>, it didn’t matter that they lost on the big game. Statistically speaking, the 1942 Chicago Bears fall into the No. 3 spot on the NFL’s best teams. Unfortunately, it still comes without a ring.

<h2>2. 2004 New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_872055" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tom-Brady-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-872055" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tom-Brady-JEFF-HAYNES-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady throws the ball against the Carolina Panthers in the Super Bowl" width="757" height="544" /></a> Jeff Haynes/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Elo blend: 1792</h2>
Since Bill Belichick and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> came together to form one of the greatest head coach-quarterback combos the NFL has ever seen, the New England Patriots have had some pretty special teams. However, if we look at it from a strictly Elo perspective, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2004.htm" target="_blank">2004 team</a> finds itself in some pretty historic company. After toppling the Carolina Panthers in the Super Bowl, these Pats finished with a season-ending (and peak) Elo of 1817, as well as a mean score of 1743. Once you average it all out, New England’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">Elo blend of 1792</a> is enough to make this team the No. 2 ranked squad in history.

<h2>1. 2007 New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_872069" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Seymour-and-Brady-Jim-McIsaac-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-872069" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Seymour-and-Brady-Jim-McIsaac-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots celebrates with Richard Seymour #93 after defeating the New York Giants to go undefeated for the season" width="757" height="550" /></a> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Elo blend: 1824</h2>
Considering the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2007.htm" target="_blank">2007 New England Patriots</a> came up short in the Super Bowl, it would be easy to find their place at the top of history’s best teams controversial. However, let’s not forget that prior to losing their final game of the season, this Pats team finished the regular season 16-0, put up 38.6 points per game, and came within one “Helmet Catch" of running the table. The Patriots may have ended the year with an Elo rating of 1824 — and, therefore, an average mark of 1797 — but at the height of their domination, their peak Elo was a whopping 1849. Therefore, if one were to go off Elo ratings alone, New England’s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-nfl-teams-of-all-time-according-to-elo/" target="_blank">blended rating of 1824</a> would make it the best team in the history of the National Football League.

		<description><![CDATA[While running backs are not typically known for their pass-catching acumen, a real dual threat can make all the difference.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/LaDainian-Tomlinson_Robert-B.-Stanton_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="576" /> LaDainian Tomlinson runs for a nice gain. | Robert B. Stanton/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the past few years, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> has become more pass oriented than ever before. This has forced organizations to spend valuable resources on the quarterback position, hoping to strike gold on a gunslinger with the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-quarterbacks-who-will-have-the-best-2016-seasons.html/" target="_blank">skills to lead them to greatness</a>. On the flip side, this shift in philosophy has made other offensive positions less valuable than they once were; more specifically, that of the running back.

Given the punishment running backs endure on a regular basis, not to mention the short lifespan associated with the position, teams have started utilizing a "running back by committee" strategy rather tailoring their offenses around a tailback. As a result, in order to remain a fixture in a team's offense, running backs have needed to become more versatile, making sure their skill sets involve more than simply carrying the ball out of the backfield. Which is why a "pass-catching running back" has become such a hot commodity in the NFL.

Not all backs are known for their ability to catch the ball out of the backfield, however, the league has seen its fair share of RBs with great hands. With that in mind, here's a look at the seven best receiving running backs of all time.
<h2><strong>7. Ronnie Harmon
</strong></h2>
While he’ll always be known for dropping what would have been a game-winning touchdown pass in the 1989 AFC Championship, judging Ronnie Harmon’s entire career as a pass-catching running back on that one play would seem to be a bit harsh. Over 11 years, Harmon managed to successfully pull in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarmRo00.htm" target="_blank">582 receptions for over 6,000 career receiving yards</a> … just not that one.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6. Tiki Barber</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Tiki-Barber-Tom-Berg-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="514" /> Tiki Barber runs for a touchdown. | Tom Berg/Getty Images[/caption]

One half of the NFL’s Barber twins (the set being completed by his identical brother, Ronde), Tiki Barber was a three-time Pro Bowler who managed to rush for over 10,000 yards during his NFL career, but his pass catching would prove equally valuable for the franchise he played for — the New York Giants, who drafted him in 1997 and watched him break nearly every team record related to rushing — nabbing <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BarbTi00.htm" target="_blank">586 catches over nine seasons</a>.
<h2>5. Marcus Allen</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FngI6dnrBjY"></iframe>

The original prototype, Marcus Allen was the first player to ever notch 5,000 yards in receptions while also earning a membership card into the 10,000 rushing yards club. The 15-year veteran, who started with the Los Angeles Raiders before finishing his career with the Kansas City Chiefs, ultimately <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AlleMa00.htm" target="_blank">compiled 587 catches</a> (or a Tiki Barber plus one more, in technical terms).

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Keith Byars</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v66vIdXyGc8"></iframe>

There are only four running backs in NFL history to have topped 600 receptions, and of those, only Keith Byars is their Ronnie Harmon — the guy who lost the ball that wound up losing his team the game. In that case, it was a fumble, his team was the Jets, and the Denver Broncos proceeded to hang 23 points on them in the AFC Championship game. He retired after that game, but not before a career that saw him perform wonderfully for the Patriots, Dolphins, and Eagles, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/ByarKe00.htm" target="_blank">notching 610 catches</a>.
<h2>3. LaDainian Tomlinson</h2>
Lawrence Taylor may be the “real” L.T., but the 2006 league MVP certainly did his initials justice over the during his time in the NFL. While playing the bulk of his career in San Diego, where his dual-threat capabilities complemented both a nascent Drew Brees and Philip Rivers extraordinarily well, Tomlinson went on to <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TomlLa00.htm" target="_blank">haul in a respectable 624 catches</a> — although they were “only” for a total of just over 4,000 yards.

<h2>2. Marshall Faulk</h2>
[caption id="attachment_711114" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-711114" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Marshall-Faulk-Tom-Mihalek-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="475" /> Marshall Faulk #28 looks to make a play. | Tom Mihalek/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

This one was a given. Most rookies step into the NFL and take some time for adjustment, but not Marshall Faulk, who put together one of the most impressive inaugural campaigns the league had ever seen, taking the first of many, many rushing steps toward establishing a Hall of Fame career. Ultimately, he would finish up having snagged <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FaulMa00.htm" target="_blank">767 catches for nearly 7,000 receiving yards</a>, averaging an NFL-best (among running backs) 39.1 receiving yards per game.
<h2>1. Larry Centers</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0QOUQkDT5LY"></iframe>

The best pass-catching RB in the history of the league, though, is none other than Larry Centers, who played from 1990 to 2003 and managed to pull in an astonishing <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CentLa00.htm" target="_blank">827 catches in his career</a>. A three-time Pro Bowler and NFL Champion, he performed admirably (albeit in a significantly smaller role than in his prime) with the New England Patriots at the age of 35.

		<description><![CDATA[Every year we see future Pro Bowlers slip through the cracks and slide into the late rounds of the NFL Draft. This year will be no different.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2016 NFL Draft turned out to be one of the most unforgettable and entertaining drafts in recent memory. We saw <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nfl-draft-why-the-titans-and-browns-are-already-winners.html/" target="_blank">two blockbuster trades</a> involving the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks, Laremy Tunsil suffer through an epic social media scandal, several more trades, some <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/7-worst-dressed-players-from-the-2016-nfl-draft.html/" target="_blank">crazy fashion choices</a>, and last but not least, several teams select players who could end up <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/2016-nfl-draft-6-best-picks-of-the-first-round.html/" target="_blank">favorably altering</a> the trajectory of their new franchises.

After a few days to reflect on what went down in Chicago, aka "Draft Town," we have identified five players who we believe will prove to be among the biggest steals of this year’s draft class. Here’s a look at what we came up with.

<em>Note: In putting together our list, we only considered players who were picked on day three (Rounds 4-7) of the draft.</em>
<h2>1. Rashard Higgins, WR, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_634678" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-634678" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Rashard-Higgins_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images-640x431.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="509" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Given his nickname, it would have been fitting if Rashard “Hollywood” Higgins ended up with the Los Angeles Rams, but as it ended up working out, the Browns landed themselves a player who could very well develop into a solid No. 2 or No. 3 wide receiver at the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">NFL</a> level in the fifth round (No. 172 overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft.

While he may not be a burner (he ran a 4.64 second 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine), Higgins flat-out knows how to get open and may actually be the best route runner in the 2016 draft class. On top of that, the 6-foot-1, 196-pounder has a knack for coming down with 50-50 balls. All said, we wouldn’t be surprised if Higgins emerges as the Browns' primary slot receiver as a rookie in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Devontae Booker, RB, Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_634682" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-634682" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Devontae-Booker_Jennifer-Stewart_Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jennifer Stewart/Getty Images[/caption]

After selecting Devontae Booker in the fourth round (No. 136 overall), Broncos’ General Manager John Elway said that the former Utah standout was the <a href="http://broncoswire.usatoday.com/2016/04/30/elway-on-devontae-booker-we-didnt-think-hed-be-there-in-the-fourth/" target="_blank">second-highest rated running back</a> on the board going into the draft. And it’s easy to see why.

With his north and south, bruising running style, Booker will be a great fit in Gary Kubiak’s zone-blocking rushing attack, and his ability to pass block and catch the ball out of the backfield will make him an excellent option on third downs from day one. When it’s all said and done, we believe that Booker will be a regular in the Broncos’ running back rotation by the end of his rookie season.
<h2>3. Jatavis Brown, LB, San Diego Chargers</h2>
If Jatavis Brown had prototypical linebacker size, he would have been a top-20 pick. Instead, the 5-foot-11, 227-pounder fell all the way down to the fifth round (No. 175 overall), but we firmly believe the former Akron standout has a promising future in the National Football League.

Brown has elite speed (4.47 second 40-yard dash), agility, and quickness, a non-stop motor, and excellent football instincts. At the very least, Brown will likely develop into one of the league’s best special teams players within the next two to three years.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Scooby Wright III, LB, Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="758"]<img class="" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Scooby-Wright_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="TUCSON, AZ - SEPTEMBER 20: Linebacker Scooby Wright III #33 of the Arizona Wildcats during the college football game against the California Golden Bears at Arizona Stadium on September 20, 2014 in Tucson, Arizona. The Wildcats defeated the Golden Bears Wildcats 49-45. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)" width="758" height="513" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Simply put, we find it incredibly hard to believe that Wright did not come off the board until the 250th overall pick in the seventh round. The former Arizona Wildcat was arguably the best defensive player in all of college football in 2014 (he was limited to only three games in 2015).

While he doesn’t have elite-level athleticism, his football IQ, competitiveness, and instincts are off the charts good. If he proves to be healthy, which by all accounts he is, Wright has the potential to develop into a Pro Bowl-caliber linebacker in the NFL.
<h2>5. Jalen Mills, S, Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
Had Jalen Mills not entered the draft with major red flags because of his character and <a href="http://www.nj.com/eagles/index.ssf/2016/04/2016_nfl_draft_what_eagles_fans_should_know_about_1.html" target="_blank">off-field behavior</a>, the former LSU Tiger likely would have been a second- or third-round pick.

Be that as it may, the Eagles took a chance on Mills in the seventh round (No. 233 overall), and we'd be shocked if the 6-foot, 191-pounder doesn’t end up making the Eagles’ 53-man roster this fall. He has the versatility to play both corner and safety in the NFL, and his football instincts will likely make him an instant special teams standout during his rookie season.

		<description><![CDATA[National Football League quarterbacks are held responsible for the outcome of every game. But who are the best, and what really constitutes the best?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The quarterback is first among equals when it comes to a football team’s offense. This is not shocking. They’re the decision-makers on the field, the one player who is almost guaranteed to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-most-clutch-playoff-quarterbacks-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">have the ball in his hand</a> in the course of every play (let’s pour one out for the Wildcat). Even when a QB gets derided as a mere “game-manager,” the not-quite slur acknowledges that even the most passable of quarterbacks is in charge of making the offense go.

As the head of operation: Points on the Board, a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/category/nfl/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> quarterback is up against every other NFL quarterback whenever they take the field. It’s inevitable. Due to a QB’s status, he is largely held responsible for every loss and every victory. In some order, it will be the head coach, the quarterback, and a defense (either a team's own or the other team’s) that will be credited for the outcome of every game.

But which quarterback in NFL history is the best? What really constitutes the best? How could anyone ever know? FootballPerspective.com took a crack at <a href="http://www.footballperspective.com/checkdowns-judging-qbs-by-their-top-5-seasons/" target="_blank">tackling this difficult question</a>, and the site seems to have done a pretty good job.

Deciding that one great season wasn’t enough to hang a career on (consider Tebow in 2012 compared to Tebow in 2014), the site took each NFL quarterback’s five best seasons and ran them through a self-proclaimed “quick-and-dirty formula.

Calculate the relative ANY/A (adjusted net yards per attempt) of each quarterback in every season since 1950; for each quarterback season, multiply each quarterback’s number of dropbacks by his relative ANY/A to derive a passing value over average metric; pro-rate non-16 game seasons to 16 games; and calculate a career grade for each quarterback based on the sum of his best five seasons.”

Sound like a lot of math? It is a lot of math. The results, though, are not nearly as complicated as the process. Check it out.
<h2><strong>5. Steve Young: 6,028 adjusted net yards over average</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_484133" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-484133" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Steve-Young-John-Mabanglo-AFP-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest Passing Quarterbacks of All Time" width="757" height="529" /> Steve Young celebrates a victory. | John Mabanglo/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Best seasons</span>: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998<strong>
</strong>

No one’s surprised that Steve Young is on the list. If anything, they’re surprised he’s so low. With separate entries into the College Football Hall of Fame and the NFL Hall of Fame, “Grit” is still holding on to the third-highest passer rating in NFL history, and he’s still holding on to his six passing titles.

So why only slot No. 5 for the 49ers legend? It goes back to the method and adjusted net yards per attempt. What’s an adjusted net yard per attempt? According to Football Perspective, it’s "(Passing Yards + 20 * Passing TDs – 45 * INTs – Sack Yards Lost) divided by (Pass Attempts + Sacks)." Make sense?

Steve Young’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/Y/YounSt00.htm" target="_blank">1994 season looks like this</a>: 3,969 yards and 35 touchdowns with 461 pass attempts, 10 interceptions, and 31 sacks for 163 yards lost. Or: (3,969 + 20*35 – 45*10 – 163) divided by (461 +31), which is 8.24. So Steve Young had an ANY/Y of 8.24 in 1994. Subtract that from the league average ANY/Y from that year to get the Relative ANY/Y.

Then, the Perspective folks multiplied that number -- which you can find on <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/" target="_blank">Pro-Football-Reference</a> in case you don’t want to do the math yourself -- by the number of dropbacks a quarterback had that season, and boom: Young scores a 1,410 in 1994, a 1,342 in '92, a 1,202 in '93, a 116 in '98, and a 904 in '91. Add those together, and you get 6,028, good for fifth all time. Easy, right?

<h2><strong>4. Dan Marino: 6,163 adjusted net yards over average</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_484136" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-484136" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dan-Marino-Rhona-Wise-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest Passing Quarterbacks of All Time" width="757" height="639" /> Dan Marino looks to pass. | Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Best years</span>: 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1992<strong>
</strong>

Dan Marino, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MariDa00.htm" target="_blank">nine-time Pro Bowler</a> and five-time passing leader (who is still the all-time leader for game-winning drives), comes in at No. 4 with the Football Perspective’s system -- because you can’t keep a good Dan down.

How do the ANY numbers compare to the real numbers? Well, in '84, the Dolphins got off to a blazing start, reeling off 11 straight wins before finally losing, in overtime, to the San Diego Chargers. They made it all the way to the Super Bowl but lost to the 49ers. In '86? They went 8-8, missing the playoffs, but Marino went nuts, averaging almost 300 yards a game and racking up the second-highest AV (approximate value -- if you had to boil down a player to one number) of his career.

His best year of the bunch was 1984, with an ANY/A of 2,271. That was his 45-touchdown year, when the Dolphins almost went all the way. Check out some of Marino at his prime right here -- it’s all his TDs in one place, plus some hilariously classic interview footage from coach Don Shula and the Marinimal himself. Also, be glad that football on television has evolved in leaps and bounds over the past 30 years.

<h2><strong>3. Drew Brees: 6,592 </strong><strong>adjusted net yards over average</strong></h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Best years</span>: 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013

Who’s that? That’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/drew-brees/" target="_blank">Drew Brees</a>, one of the most pass-happy quarterbacks to ever make it to the NFL. It’s not a shock to see Breesus ranked this highly on any list that’s based on any kind of “he throws the football better than most” list, but did you really expect last season to make an appearance on his best ever? You don’t have to lie.

In the 2013 season, the Saints went 11-5 and made a strong push into the playoffs -- until they, like everyone else, got shot down by the Seattle Seahawks -- behind the return of Sean Payton, absent last year owing to BountyGate, and the rocket arm of No. 9. Climbing more than 5,000 yards thrown for the third straight season, Brees was able to pull off an A.N.Y./A of 1,123. Not bad.

His best year was 2011, when he <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BreeDr00.htm" target="_blank">threw for 5,476 yards on 468 completion</a>s (both best in the league that season) for an ANY/A of 1,590. The Saints got knocked off by the 49ers in the playoffs. So it goes. Here he is at his best.

<h2><strong>2. Tom Brady: 6,853 </strong><strong>adjusted net yards over average</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_484138" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-484138" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/New-England-Patriots-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 5 Greatest Passing Quarterbacks of All Time" width="757" height="504" /> Quarterback Tom Brady | Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Best years</span>: 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012

Again, a pass-happy QB, high ANY/A rating. The interesting thing about <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/tom-brady/" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> is how many different systems he’s been able to rock the rocket arm. Think back to that ridiculous 2007 season. Brady to Moss. Brady to Moss. 16-0. Deep bomb after deep bomb. So on and so forth. Absurdly awesome offense doing incredible things on the football field. We all know that.

That team bears almost no resemblance to the 2012 squad, which was well on its way to blazing a new offensive trail with a pair of hyperathletic, pass-catching tight ends in Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez. Now, of course, Hernandez is in jail for life and Gronkowski misses more games than he plays.

Consider that for a second. Brady, more than any other QB in modern history, has been able to continually refine his game and his system (coach Bill Belichick deserves a lot of the credit here, too) to match up with his declining arm strength. Joke about deflation all you want, but the team that won the 2014 Super Bowl is far removed from prior successful years.

Here are some Brady highlights <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KjjVNeMo64" target="_blank">from 2007</a>. Give it a look and see just how different that offense is from 2012.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JEC5EfdVUZQ"></iframe>
<h2><strong>1. Peyton Manning: 8,115 adjusted net yards over average</strong></h2>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Best years</span>: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013

It’s not even close. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/tag/peyton-manning/" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a> is the best passer in NFL history, and that was true before he went on the warpath with the Denver Broncos in 2013, <a href="http://www.milehighreport.com/2013/12/31/5255828/broncos-nfl-records-2013-peyton-manning" target="_blank">burning down the offensive record book</a> and replacing it with a portrait of Peyton. (Of course, Seattle promptly went back and replaced that painting of Manning with <a href="http://www.manningface.com/" target="_blank">Manning Face</a>).

That wasn’t his best season, though. As a passer, Manning’s best year was 2004, when he dropped an ANY/A score of 2,113. To put it in perspective, Brady’s 2007 notched a 2,014, and Manning’s 2013 was worth 2,031. Check it out below, and remember: They lost to the Patriots in the playoffs that year.

		<description><![CDATA[Michael Vick is a shadow of the player he once was. Will he get another chance to earn one last contract?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_581256" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-581256" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Michael-Vick_Jared-Wickerham_Getty-Images-1024x774-640x484.jpg" alt="Michael-Vick_Jared-Wickerham_Getty-Images-1024x774.jpg" width="757" height="572" /> Michael Vick | Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

In the not too distant past, Michael Vick was the face of the Atlanta Falcons and arguably the most exciting player in the league due to his unique physical ability to be a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/top-7-rushing-quarterbacks-in-nfl-history.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">game-changing player with both his arm and legs</a>. The former Virginia Tech product helped make the Falcons one of the most enticing teams in the NFL. He made eye-popping plays look normal, and he was one of the most difficult players for an opposing defense to game plan against.

What made Vick most effective during his tenure with Atlanta was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/who-are-the-nfls-greatest-mobile-quarterbacks.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">being an elusive runner</a> when he decided to scramble, which only added more effectiveness to his speed and quickness. It comes as no surprise that he became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season, including more than 750 rushing yards three times.

However, all of this came to an end as Vick became <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3718304" target="_blank">involved in a dog fighting scandal</a> that saw him get jail time and miss two complete seasons during the prime of his career. He got a second chance with the Philadelphia Eagles, making two playoff appearances and posting the first two 3,000-passing-yard campaigns of his career.

Vick had the most productive season of his career in 2010, earning his fourth Pro Bowl selection and AP NFL Comeback Player of the Year by posting career highs in touchdowns (21) and passer rating (100.2) while rushing for 676 yards and nine touchdowns. Things took a progressive tumble over the next few seasons, though, due to injuries and inconsistent play.

He signed with the New York Jets and eventually the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he was relegated to a backup role in both situations. Vick did have another opportunity to start in 2015 with the Steelers -- when Ben Roethlisberger suffered a knee injury -- making three starts in his place before a hamstring injury against the Arizona Cardinals forced him to miss the remainder of the season. This led many to believe that his playing days were over, but Vick recently stated that he still has interest in extending his career at least one more year.<!--nextpage-->

“I've got one more dedicated season in my blood, if somebody needs me to come in," Vick told the <a href="http://www.dailypress.com/sports/virginia-tech/dp-spt-teel-column-tyrod-camp-20160402-column.html" target="_blank">DailyPress.com</a>. "But I'm kind of happy where I am right now. I've got my health, I've got my kids, I've got my family. The game has done so much for me in terms of relationships, opportunities to take care of myself and my family. I'm just thankful. I give all the credit to God."

The soon-to-be 36-year-old may not be the same physical specimen that he was during the prime of his career, but he still has plenty to offer a team as a threat with his legs. If anything, Vick can be a viable option as a backup quarterback. He proved that last season with Pittsburgh, holding a 1-1 record in the two starts. Both could have resulted in wins had his team not fallen short in overtime to the Baltimore Ravens.

In that same breath, Vick has expressed the desire to return to the Steelers for another campaign because of the culture and comfort he has with the organization. He <a href="http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Vick-I-love-the-Steelers-organization/79dcc723-41f4-41b7-9bb1-18d322014150" target="_blank">told Steelers.com</a>:
<blockquote>It’s a special group, it’s a special atmosphere. It’s a special group of coaches. I think Coach [Mike] Tomlin and what he demands from the players, he gives it to us but at the end of the day he understands we are men. He puts responsibility on us and we respond.

I think it’s the type of coach he is in terms of how he treats his players. He makes his players want to work hard for him. From Day 1, from the time I got here, it was a family oriented atmosphere. My first day felt like I had been here for two months because everybody welcomed me in. You can’t ask for more.</blockquote>
If the Steelers continue to show no strong interest in bringing him back this upcoming season, other teams looking for much-needed stability could present him with opportunities. The bottom line: The quarterback is the most important position in the NFL, and the opportunity to add a player like Vick, who has 15 years of experience along with a playmaking ability, may be enough to earn him one more shot at extending his career.

		<description><![CDATA[The Green Bay Packers had a heartbreaking end to their 2015-16 season, so let's take a look at next season -- with three bold predictions.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_926802" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-926802" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Davante-Adams-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

To say that the Green Bay Packers’ 2015-16 season came to a close with a flurry of emotions would be a massive understatement. After making the playoffs with a 10-6 record, the <a title="Packers rolled over" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-just-how-dangerous-are-the-green-bay-packers.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">Packers rolled over</a> the Washington Redskins 35-18 in the first round. Then came that infamous game against the Arizona Cardinals, with a chance to go to the NFC championship on the line. We all know how that one ended, as a Hail Mary sent the game to overtime for the Packers, but it just wasn’t enough.

Larry Fitzgerald got through Green Bay’s defense for 75 yards to start overtime, and then two plays later, Fitzgerald crossed the goal line and sent his Cardinals to the next round. It was heartbreak hotel for Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, but it was still a strong season for a team who lost their top wide receiver, Jordy Nelson, while also getting little production from their running game.

Their leading rusher, Eddie Lacy, had just 758 yards and three touchdowns, and running backs in total (including fullback John Kuhn) totaled just seven rushing scores all season. So, it’s time for Green Bay fans to look toward 2016. We’ll start things off with Lacy himself, who basically saw the <a title="law get laid down" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000625109/article/mike-mccarthy-eddie-lacy-has-a-lot-of-work-to-do?" target="_blank">law get laid down</a> for him by head coach Mike McCarthy.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Eddie Lacy will have the best year of his career</h2>
[caption id="attachment_705913" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-705913" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456402122.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="597" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

At times, Lacy’s 2015 campaign was tough to watch. He was constantly stuffed by opponents’ defensive fronts and had <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LacyEd00.htm" target="_blank">eight games with 38 or fewer rushing yards</a>. That’s brutal, especially when looking at the fact that he also had four games with 10 or fewer rushing yards. For either of those statistics to be next to the name of a starting NFL running back is just completely unacceptable.

Things got so bad at times for Lacy that the team had to turn their attention to James Starks, who finished with 39 carries and 157 yards less than Lacy. Neither back was amazing in 2015, but it’s going to be Lacy who takes McCarthy’s words to heart and turns things around in a big way. Not only will he become the workhorse back once again in Green Bay, but he’ll be even better than he was back in his rookie season when he rushed for 1,178 yards and 11 scores.

See, the thing is, this is a contract year for Lacy now. If he can show up in a big way, it’s far more likely that he can command a fairly good-sized contract on the free agent market. On the flip side, if he has a year like he did in 2015, he’s not going to make much and will wind up being just a change-of-pace back somewhere else. We expect him to have about 1,200 yards, at least 11 touchdowns, and most importantly, a higher average yards-per-carry than he did during that rookie year (4.1).

<h2>2. Aaron Rodgers wins the MVP award</h2>
[caption id="attachment_910842" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-910842" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Aaron-Rodgers-Dallas-Cowboys-v-Green-Bay-Packers-GascafhYfopl.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

With Lacy’s improved play, the return of Nelson, and a much healthier team across the board, Rodgers will take over in ways that we’ve seen in the past. Many people seem to overlook the fact that Rodgers was actually pretty strong last season, but he just didn’t have the massive number of yards that we’re used to seeing from him. Even without his top weapon and a group of wide receivers who failed to step up at times — paired with almost no running game — Rodgers still threw for 3,821 yards, 31 touchdowns, and just eight interceptions.

Concerning interceptions, he’s done an excellent job of avoiding them, and this stood true once again. With a revamped run game, expect Rodgers to return to elite level. Heck, if the guy was able to throw for 31 touchdowns and avoid turning the ball over in as tough of a year as it was for the Packers last season, imagine what he could do next year. We’re talking 35-plus touchdowns, 4,300 or more yards, and again, very few interceptions. Rodgers will lead the Packers to a division title and his own MVP award.

<h2>3. Jordy Nelson immediately reverts back to 2014 form</h2>
[caption id="attachment_875496" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-875496" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jordy-Nelson-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="533" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

If you want to see how much Rodgers truly missed Nelson, wait until you see these two start to connect on the field in 2016. Not having Nelson obviously hurt the Packers, and it’s hard to imagine how a player will bounce back from a knee injury, but expect Nelson to return to building on what he did in 2014. While he didn’t have the most touchdowns of his career last season, he caught the most passes (98), had the most receiving yards (1,519), and had the second-most touchdowns with 13.

Don’t be surprised to see Nelson get more targets than he’ll even know what to do with, which should result in him topping 100 catches for the first time in his career while also winding up with double-digit touchdowns. Nelson is one of the most talented wide receivers in the NFL, but with players like Julio Jones and Antonio Brown being reception monsters, Nelson is getting a bit overlooked right now. Fortunately, that won’t happen for much longer.

		<description><![CDATA[It's fair to assume that Robert Griffin III will not be with the Washington Redskins come 2016. Here are five possible landing spots for the embattled quarterback.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_916964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-916964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Robert Griffin III looks over before a game against the Cowboys" width="757" height="505" /></a> Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]

Now that the 2016 NFL season is in the rear view, there's not much left to do but to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-best-nfl-free-agents-of-2016.html/" target="_blank">look forward to to the offseason, free agency</a>, and quarterback controversies. After accounting for five touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) in his team’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400791695" target="_blank">35-25 victory</a> over the Buffalo Bills, Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins made his weekly appearance on Grant &amp; Danny on 106.7 The Fan the following Monday morning. There he was asked about his impending free agency and whether or not he wished to remain with the Redskins. Cousins was quite straightforward <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/12/21/cousins-i-want-to-be-where-im-wanted/" target="_blank">in his response</a>:
<blockquote>Bottom line, like anybody else in any line of work, any job you have, you want to be where you’re wanted. And I’m no different. So that’s the bottom line: I want to be where I’m wanted, and we’ll find out where I’m wanted in a few months. But we have a job to do before that, and that’s where my focus is: on right here and right now. And if we get the job done, I’d like to think I’ll be wanted here.</blockquote>
Well, if the report from Mike Jones of The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/football-insider/wp/2015/12/21/redskins-are-sold-on-kirk-cousins-but-remain-undecided-on-his-value/?postshare=7221450712862671&amp;tid=ss_tw" target="_blank">told us anything</a>, it’s that the feeling appears to be mutual. According to Jones, “The Washington Redskins are sold on Kirk Cousins as their starting quarterback beyond this season, and because of that, team officials are determined to avoid letting the fourth-year veteran depart via free agency this offseason." If you’re Cousins, this is great news. However, if you’re Griffin III — the No. 2 overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft and once-starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins — it probably is not good news.

Interestingly enough, the Redskins did <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000488248/article/redskins-will-pick-up-rgiiis-fifthyear-option" target="_blank">pick up RGIII’s fifth-year option</a> this past offseason. However, when you take into consideration that it will cost the organization <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/washington-redskins/robert-griffin-iii/" target="_blank">a little over $16.1 million in 2016</a>, it’s safe to assume the former face of the franchise will seek employment elsewhere come next season, and <a href="http://www.wusa9.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2016/01/11/rgiii-leaves-behind-forgive-them-note-locker/78643866/" target="_blank">the note he left in a cleaned out locker</a> speaks to that as well. Here are five potential landing spots.

<h2>1. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_916975" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Garrett-and-Romo-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-916975" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Garrett-and-Romo-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys coach Jason Garrett (L) chats with QB Tony Romo" width="757" height="505" /></a> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

If we’ve learned anything from watching the Dallas Cowboys play in 2015, it’s that they're terrible without quarterback Tony Romo under center. As a result, given that the four-time Pro Bowler spent most of the season <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14233206/tony-romo-dallas-cowboys-season-latest-collarbone-injury" target="_blank">out of the lineup due to injury</a> and will turn 36 next April, we’d say it’s about time that Jerry Jones and company begin the search for his eventual replacement — or at least a legitimate backup. And who knows, perhaps that search will begin and end with Griffin III.

<h2>2. Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_916977" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cleveland-Browns-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-916977" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cleveland-Browns-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Johnny Manziel chats with the Cleveland staff" width="757" height="505" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

Consider us among those who believed it was in Cleveland’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-browns-need-to-stick-with-johnny-manziel.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">best interest to start Johnny Manziel</a> at quarterback toward the end of the 2015 season. Quite frankly, the organization needed to see what they had in the former Heisman Trophy winner. But off-the-field antics aside, we’re not sure Johnny Football has done enough to prove he deserves to be the Browns’ QB of the future. Truth be told, we have no idea if RGIII has what it takes to cut it in Cleveland (after all, it is the place where starting quarterbacks go to die). Still, under these circumstances, it might be worth the risk to give the partnership a try

<h2>3. New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_916983" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Payton-and-Brees-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-916983" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Payton-and-Brees-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Saints coach Sean Payton chats with quarterback Drew Brees" width="757" height="505" /></a> Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to Pro Bowl quarterback Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints have a major decision to make. Despite everything he’s done for the organization since arriving in 2006, Brees is 36 years old (he turns 37 in January) and is scheduled to bring with him a <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-orleans-saints/drew-brees/" target="_blank">cap hit of $30 million in 2016</a>. If the Saints can’t justify spending that kind of money on an aging quarterback, perhaps it’s time for the franchise to bring in a young quarterback for head coach Sean Payton (if he’s still in New Orleans next season) to mold. If anyone has what it takes to get the best out of RGIII, it’s the guy in the visor above.

<h2>4. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_917015" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bradford-and-Kelly-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-917015" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bradford-and-Kelly-Kevin-C.-Cox-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Sam Bradford and Eagles coach Chip Kelly chat" width="757" height="505" /></a> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Eagles head coach Chip Kelly made it perfectly clear that he wanted Sam Bradford to <a href="http://www.nj.com/eagles/index.ssf/2015/12/chip_kelly_says_eagles_want_to_re-sign_sam_bradfor.html" target="_blank">be in Philadelphia in 2016</a>. That, of course, was back when Chip Kelly was Philly's head coach. Now, with the former St. Louis Rams quarterback set to hit free agency after the season, there is no indication that the feeling is mutual. On top of that, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000604851/article/texans-eagles-cowboys-might-be-interested-in-rgiii" target="_blank">according to NFL Media Insider</a> Ian Rapoport, the Eagles are one of a handful of teams that have shown interest in Griffin.  Maybe 2016 will be the year we get to see if RGIII can be that guy.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_917017" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Manning-and-Osweiler-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-917017" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Manning-and-Osweiler-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning chats with Brock Osweiler #17" width="757" height="505" /></a> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

Every list needs a wildcard, and the Denver Broncos fit the bill. No one knows what the future holds for Peyton Manning. He’s not getting any younger and his body (more importantly, his arm) is not getting any stronger. As for backup-turned-starting quarterback Brock Osweiler (above, right), the jury is still out on whether or not he’s the right guy to replace the surefire Hall of Famer in Denver. Griffin may not be a great QB when he’s put under center, but Broncos coach Gary Kubiak might be fascinated by what RGIII can offer in the play-action game. Would this pairing <em>actually</em> make sense? Stranger things have happened.

		<description><![CDATA[Johnny Manziel may be on his way out of town, but let's take a look at the five places Manziel could most likely play in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_908801" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-908801" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Johnny-Manziel-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="CLEVELAND, OH - NOVEMBER 30: Johnny Manziel #2 of the Cleveland Browns warms up prior to the game against the Baltimore Ravens at FirstEnergy Stadium on November 30, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio." width="757" height="520" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Johnny Manziel was supposed to lead the Browns to a lot of places (like Las Vegas, maybe), but a 3-13 record wasn't one of them (as the starter, Manziel would go 2-4). While it’s obvious that Manziel has had his ups and downs both on and off the field, he’s still talented enough, or at least famous enough, to get at least one more shot in the NFL. The question becomes, are the Browns willing to work through the issues away from the game in hopes that he’s their quarterback of the future, or will they part ways with him this off-season? <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-would-johnny-manziels-release-be-a-blessing-in-disguise.html/" target="_blank">The answer seems to be the latter</a>, so let’s look at four teams that may end up with the quarterback’s services in 2016.
<h2>1. St. Louis Rams</h2>
No surprise here. You probably knew that the Rams were pretty bad at passing the ball in 2015 -- you may have even guessed, correctly, that they were <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2015.htm" target="_blank">the worst passing team in the league</a>. To make things even worse, between three quarterbacks (although Sean Mannion threw just seven passes), they have a total of 11 touchdown passes on the season. That's one more touchdown than the number of interceptions thrown by incumbent starter Nick Foles.

The Rams finished off the year 7-9 and could be moving to Los Angeles, but that doesn’t mean they’ll look to spend their draft pick on a quarterback, whether or not they should. Bringing Manziel into town, especially if it just costs them a mid-to-late-round draft pick to land him, could be a nice option for the team, as St. Louis needs someone who can ease the pressure off rookie running back Todd Gurley.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_891014" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-891014" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Blaine-Gabbert_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images-640x432.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="511" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

While some are desperately trying to deem Blaine Gabbert as the future of 49ers football, we aren’t there just yet. Gabbert has done a solid job replacing Colin Kaepernick (who is all but certainly on his way out the door), but it likely won’t be enough to hold the job if someone like Manziel comes to town. Now, if the 49ers decide to draft a quarterback, starting Gabbert for another season would make sense, to give the rookie a year to learn.

That may not even happen, but if Manziel joins Chip Kelly with the 49ers,  we believe the former Texas A&amp;M star would get the nod as the starter in San Francisco. As the season came to a close, Gabbert had completed 63% of his passes, with 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions through eight games. It hasn’t been bad, not by a long shot (shout out to his last game of the season, where he threw for over 350  yards) , but it will be interesting to see how the higher-ups in the organization view him, and whether or not he's worth playing.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_858255" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-858255 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chip-Kelly_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

Sam Bradford’s time with the Eagles may be nearly up, barring some type of run to the postseason, which is possible in the woeful NFC East. Even without Chip Kelly in town, the team needs a quarterback. While Manziel is, from the look of things, struggling to keep it together, a career move to Philly wouldn’t shock us in the slightest. Keep an eye on this situation, because Manziel in Philadelphia could be fun to watch — even though it’s not likely, they're desperately in need of any players in a post Chip rebuild.
<h2>4. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
Would you put it past Jerry Jones to bring in his man crush in Manziel to sit behind Romo and prepare?

This could work if the Cowboys make it known immediately that Manziel is the backup and that Romo is the starter. Allowing Manziel a bit of time to learn behind Romo would be great, and if you’re going to pick one team who would overpay for Manziel, it would likely be Dallas. Jones hasn’t shied away from his love for Manziel, and with Romo getting older, the team would be wise to prepare for the future. Don’t be surprised if that future is indeed Manziel. While the best idea for Dallas is to basically start over, we can’t really put it past them to make the NFL even more of a circus by signing the former Johnny Football.

		<description><![CDATA[Colin Kaepernick's days in San Francisco may be numbered. Here are 4 teams that may be desperate enough to give him another chance.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_876224" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-876224" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Colin-Kaepernick_Thearon-W.-Henderson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 4 Teams Desperate Enough to Sign Colin Kaepernick" width="757" height="505" /> Colin Kaepernick | Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

The 2016 Super Bowl is in the books, the Denver Broncos have been <a title="crowned as the champions" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-what-the-broncos-super-bowl-victory-means.html/" target="_blank">crowned the champions</a>, and the NFL Draft Combine is over, which means it’s time to get through the “NFL drought." In the meantime, we’ll talk about Colin Kaepernick. Yes, him. The man who once led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl and back-to-back NFC championship games is now well on his way out the door.

It’s widely known that Kaepernick wants out of San Francisco, and according to Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News, he’d prefer to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/colin-kaepernick-49ers-jets-sources-article-1.2518118" target="_blank">land with the New York Jets</a>. While it seems unlikely that the Jets will make this move, there will still be teams that are interested in Kaepernick’s skill set. Who are the four teams desperate enough to bring in this quarterback? Kaepernick may not have the greatest numbers, but he has talent.

Through his four seasons as a starter, he’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KaepCo00.htm" target="_blank">thrown for 9,995 yards</a>, completed 59.9% of his passes, and has 56 touchdowns against 26 interceptions. Kaepernick has done decent work running the ball, rushing for 1,832 yards and 11 touchdowns as well. Let’s take a look at the four teams that could make a push for Kaepernick — whether through trade or free agency — if he gets released.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_738971" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-738971" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Manziel-Grant-Halverson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 4 Teams Desperate Enough to Sign Colin Kaepernick" width="757" height="504" /> Former Cleveland Browns QB Johnny Manziel | Grant Halverson/Getty Images[/caption]

The Browns make this list not because we believe that Kaepernick would be the best fit for them, but instead because they just badly need a quarterback. In all honesty, it’s not likely that the Browns will make this move, but when desperation kicks in, they may decide to give it a run. The main reason why Cleveland is an unlikely suitor: They currently own the No. 2 pick in the draft, sitting behind the Tennessee Titans, which drafted Marcus Mariota last season.

This means that Cleveland should be able to take its pick from a quarterback class including Jared Goff, Carson Wentz, and Paxton Lynch. Now, if Cleveland decides not to go that route, they could trade back, add picks, draft another young stud, and potentially sign Kaepernick. Hey, if they see a bright future for him, then why not? It may not be the most likely move for the Browns, but it’s one that needs to be put on the table and considered as we move forward.

<h2>2. Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_851151" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-851151 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Brian-Hoyer-Chris-Greythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 4 Teams Desperate Enough to Sign Colin Kaepernick" width="757" height="504" /> QB Brian Hoyer of the Houston Texans | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

Now we’re getting into situations that seems more likely. Brian Hoyer has one more season with the Texans before they are once again in search of their quarterback of the future. So, why not give Kaepernick a shot to come in and compete with Hoyer? It’s unknown whether or not Kaepernick would be able to actually beat Hoyer out for the job, but it’s worth finding out.

Hoyer showed flashes of competency last season, but his brutal playoff performance against the Kansas City Chiefs left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans, as well as many people in the organization. For the time being, Hoyer is the man in Houston, but Kaepernick has the potential to light a spark under this offense, and he would get to work with superstar DeAndre Hopkins. Pairing Kaepernick and Hopkins would be interesting and possibly enough to actually save Kaepernick’s career when all is said and done.

<h2>3. Los Angeles Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_855338" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-855338 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jeff-Fisher-and-Stan-Kroenke-Michael-Thomas-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 4 Teams Desperate Enough to Sign Colin Kaepernick" width="757" height="504" /> Head coach Jeff Fisher of the St. Louis Rams talks with team owner Stan Kroenke before a game. | Michael Thomas/Getty Images[/caption]

Unfortunately for Rams fans who hope to see them draft a top quarterback, it seems unlikely that one will fall to them at No. 15 in the first round. The Rams put together a pretty solid season, especially with all of the question marks at quarterback. While Case Keenum played well at times, it seems that Nick Foles is probably done with the Rams. With a new home for this team, how about about a new quarterback to bring along with them? It’s possible, and Kaepernick may just be that man.

Whether the team chooses to bring back Keenum or not is kind of irrelevant, because in all honesty, it’s pretty unlikely that he’ll be their future at the position. For at least the time being, the Rams need to find a new option at quarterback, so why not Kaepernick? It makes a lot of sense. He’d have a stellar running back in Todd Gurley in the backfield with him as well, which should make his life quite a bit easier.

<h2>4. Philadelphia Eagles</h2>
[caption id="attachment_852596" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-852596 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sam-Bradford_Jon-Durr_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL: 4 Teams Desperate Enough to Sign Colin Kaepernick" width="757" height="504" /> Sam Bradford of the Philadelphia Eagles | Jon Durr/Getty Images[/caption]

While Brandon Lee Gowton of Bleeding Green Nation broke down why Sam Bradford <a title="may not be back" href="http://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2016/2/10/10957808/sam-bradford-eagles-nfl-free-agency-contract-quarterback-franchise-tag-analysis" target="_blank">may not be back</a> in Philadelphia, there’s one reason that really jumps out as the most obvious: He wasn’t very good. Bradford’s first season with the Eagles was filled with mediocrity, as he threw for 3,725 yards, 19 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions. He also had a quarterback rating of just 86.4, so it’s obvious that his time in Philadelphia may have come to an end.

So, again, why not Kaep? Philadelphia is unlikely to have a shot at the top quarterbacks in the 2016 NFL draft unless they make a trade, and the free agency class isn’t exactly loaded with superstars. Kaepernick could be a great addition, and while he’ll come with some scrutiny from this fanbase, there’s a good chance that he could help keep them in playoff contention. The Eagles need a quarterback badly, and Kaepernick may need a new team. Say hello to a match made in heaven.

		<description><![CDATA[The Mile High City has a long and storied history in the NFL. There's more to the Broncos than their great quarterbacks and a 3-4 defense, though.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_764332" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-764332 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Broncos-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

Denver Broncos football brings to mind a rocking Mile High stadium, cold weather games, bright orange uniforms, 3-4 defense, and spectacular quarterback plays from a perennial contender and one of the more respected franchises out of the American Football Conference. Throughout the '70s and '80s, however, legions of NFL fans mocked the Broncos for “not being able to win the Big One.” The Broncos, of course, had been on the wrong end of blowout Super Bowl losses to the NFC, in 1977, 1986, 1987, and 1989.

In Hollywood fashion, an aging John Elway finally led the Broncos to the Promised Land, in claiming back-to-back Lombardi trophies in 1997 and 1998. It follows, then, that many of the greatest players in franchise history would have been instrumental to the title runs that swung the perception of this franchise.

<h2>1. Peyton Manning</h2>
In Denver, Peyton Manning has been a glorified hired gun, signed to win a Super Bowl as soon as possible. That doesn’t mean he’s not an incredible player. As part of this “win now” mentality, John Elway successfully recruited Manning to Denver in 2012. From there, Denver followed that with the acquisition of Wes Welker, a safety valve for Manning out of the slot, and after suffering a blowout Super Bowl XLVIII loss to the Seahawks, the Broncos rebuilt their defense, in picking up Aqib Talib and DeMarcus Ware as high profile free agents.

As a Bronco, Peyton Manning has compiled a 38-10 regular season record. This record includes <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00.htm" target="_blank">a 2013 run when the then-37-year-old lit up the League for 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns</a>. By retirement, Peyton Manning is likely to surpass Brett Favre’s one-time ownership of every major passing record, and one more title run may complete the final chapter of this storybook career.

<h2>2. Champ Bailey</h2>
Likely a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer, Champ Bailey is already hailed as one of the greatest cornerbacks of all time. In 2004, the Washington Redskins and Denver Broncos completed a straight-up trade of Clinton Portis and Champ Bailey. At the time, the two were deemed equals, but the Broncos came out on top in retrospect, as the franchise kept cranking out 1,000-yard rushers Reuben Droughns, Tatum Bell, Travis Henry, and Mike Anderson, byproducts of Mike Shanahan’s zone-blocking scheme.

In his prime, Bailey emerged as the league’s most prominent shut down corner. In 2006, Bailey <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BailCh00.htm" target="_blank">led the NFL</a> with 10 interceptions. In run support, Bailey would shed blockers and make form tackles out on the edge. As an added bonus, he would often blitz off the slot to harass the quarterback in passing situations. Bailey racked up 522 tackles, 34 interceptions, and 3 return touchdowns, in 10 years of service with the Broncos.

<h2>3. Shannon Sharpe</h2>
In true rags-to-riches form, the Denver Broncos selected Shannon Sharpe out of tiny Savannah State with the 192nd overall pick (7th round) in the 1990 NFL Draft. By 1992, Sharpe had worked his way into the starting lineup, before making a name for himself as a fierce competitor, brash trash talker, and one of the most prolific tight ends of all-time. At 6-foot-2 and 230 pounds, Sharpe was too fast for linebackers to cover in space, and too physical for defensive backs to handle on jump balls and post corner routes toward the back of the end zone.

As a Denver Bronco, Sharpe <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SharSh00.htm" target="_blank">hauled in 675 receptions for 8,439 yards and 55 touchdowns</a>. He was especially instrumental in winning back-to-back 1997-1998 titles for Denver. In 1997, Sharpe was a big play threat at tight end, as his 1,107 yards on 72 catches broke down to 15.4 yards-per-catch. The following season, he emerged as the go-to guy at the goal line with 10 touchdown receptions.

<h2>4. Terrell Davis</h2>
For one quick flash in time, Terrell Davis was the most dominant running back in the National Football League. As a sixth-round pick out of Georgia, Davis immediately took the league by storm, racking up 6,413 rushing yards and 61 total touchdowns <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaviTe00.htm" target="_blank">through his first four seasons as a Bronco</a>. As a complete back with vision and balance, TD was the perfect fit for Mike Shanahan’s zone blocking scheme, where linemen would clear out a particular space rather than grappling with one man.

In Super Bowl XXXII, Terrell Davis <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199801250den.htm" target="_blank">ran for 157 yards and 3 touchdowns</a> to take home MVP honors. Ironically, it was the running game that carried Hall of Fame quarterback John Elway and the Denver Broncos to their first Super Bowl win, which came against the Green Bay Packers. The following season, Davis cracked the 2000-yard plateau, while also hitting pay dirt 21 times on the ground. The Broncos, again, went on to repeat as champions, with TD picking up 102 rushing yards against the Falcons.

Three years later, however, Terrell Davis was already out of football, his career was cut all too short by an assortment of knee and leg injuries.

<h2>5. John Elway</h2>
John Elway was the Golden Boy. At Stanford, Elway was a star quarterback and baseball player, while also majoring in economics. In 1982, he was actually drafted into the New York Yankees farm system. In 1983, Elway effectively forced a trade to Denver after being drafted by the Colts, torching defenses with both his rocket arm and his scrambling, the ability to convert broken plays into first downs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWGx_P9KPZg" target="_blank">The Drive</a> best captured Elway’s young career. In 1987, John Elway marched the Broncos 98 yards downfield for the winning touchdown in the AFC Championship Game at Cleveland. After advancing to the Super Bowl, however, the Washington Redskins dismantled the Broncos 42-10. In four years, John Elway lost three Super Bowls by a combined 136-40 score, to the Giants, Redskins, and 49ers.

In the twilight of his career, Elway joined forces with head coach Mike Shanahan, and Shanahan worked to install a dominant running game in order to finally take the pressure off of Elway. In Super Bowl XXXII, John Elway (then 37) tucked the ball in and took off on third-and-six in the red zone. Shortly thereafter, Elway absorbed a vicious hit from Packers safety LeRoy, but still picked up the first down. Eventually Elway would bring home the first out of two Lombardi trophies to the city of Denver.

		<description><![CDATA[With Matthew Stafford's future with the Detroit Lions allegedly in doubt, here's a look at 5 potential landing spots for the QB in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_885836" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Matthew-Stafford-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885836" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Matthew-Stafford-Gregory-Shamus-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Matthew Stafford looks on against the Vikings" width="757" height="515" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The Detroit Lions are shaking things up. <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-4-potential-landing-spots-for-calvin-johnson.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">And not everyone will be safe</a>. That much was clear when Lions owner Martha Ford <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14059034/detroit-lions-fire-gm-martin-mayhew-president-tom-lewand" target="_blank">announced the firing</a> of team president Tom Lewand and general manager Martin Mayhew.

Said Ford during a 1 minute, 53 second statement in December: “We are very disappointed with the results of the season so far. And believe a change in leadership was necessary."

With the Lions holding a 1-7 record and sitting in fourth place in the NFC North, the time had clearly come to make some moves. And while it’s not uncommon to see a shakeup in the front office or on the coaching staff, there seems to be the belief that it won’t stop there.

<a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-network-around-the-nfl/0ap3000000573611/Rapoport-Stafford-s-future-with-Lions-is-in-doubt" target="_blank">NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported</a> that he was told quarterback <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm" target="_blank">Matthew Stafford</a>'s future in Detroit is “very much in doubt." Of course, it didn’t stop there. <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/11/05/detroit-lions-matthew-stafford/75231568/" target="_blank">Rapoport continued</a>:
<blockquote>“There’s a lot going on with Matthew Stafford now … he was benched earlier in the year which, for a franchise quarterback, never happens," Rapaport said. “I’m also told that Joe Lombardi, the former offensive coordinator, was frustrated that he couldn’t put enough on Stafford’s plate, did not think he was able to handle it, was not taking as much control of the offense as the coaching staff wanted.

“In fact, new offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter actually had to simplify things for Stafford. All of which, in part, leads to the conclusion that Stafford’s days in Detroit are very much numbered."</blockquote>
We’re in no position to say whether Stafford will be a part of the Detroit Lions’ plans for the future. However, considering he does have a Pro Bowl appearance under his belt, we can’t help but discuss the possibility of him suiting up for a new team next season. Therefore, since it’s always fun to speculate, here’s a look at five potential landing spots for Matthew Stafford in 2016.

<h2>1. Houston Texans</h2>
[caption id="attachment_885841" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Houston-Texans-Thomas-B.-Shea-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885841" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Houston-Texans-Thomas-B.-Shea-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brian Hoyer #7 leads the Texans huddle" width="757" height="554" /></a> Thomas B. Shea/Getty Images[/caption]

At 3-5, believe it or not, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/htx/2015.htm" target="_blank">Houston Texans</a> currently find themselves tied with the Indianapolis Colts at the top of the AFC South standings. On top of that, quarterback <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/12477/brian-hoyer" target="_blank">Brian Hoyer</a> has quietly put together a pretty solid season thus far. In the six games he’s seen the field, the Texans QB has completed 60% of his passes for 1,581 yards, 13 touchdowns, and just three interceptions. However, despite his mild success in 2015, we’re not completely convinced he’s the Texans’ answer at the quarterback position. If he can finish out strong the rest of the season, perhaps Houston won’t be in the market for a new QB next season. If not, we’re sure coach Bill O’Brien would love the opportunity to see what he could do with a quarterback like Stafford.

<h2>2. Washington Redskins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_885843" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Garcon-and-Cousins-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885843" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Garcon-and-Cousins-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Garcon is congratulated by Cousins" width="757" height="504" /></a> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

One things for certain, Robert Griffin III will not be the Washington Redskins starting quarterback in 2016. That ship has officially sailed, which leads us to this year’s starter <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880" target="_blank">Kirk Cousins</a>. While he has managed to produce magic at times, Cousins has struggled more often than not in 2015. And yet, despite his inconsistent play (and that’s putting it nicely), head coach <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000560278/article/jay-gruden-backs-kirk-cousins-despite-redskins-struggles" target="_blank">Jay Gruden continues to back No. 8</a>. But let’s be serious, prior to the start of the season Gruden did the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-this-a-make-or-break-year-for-rgiii.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">same thing with RGIII</a>. And look how that turned out. The fact that Cousins went on to throw eight interceptions in seven games and has a quarterback rating of 85.1. If Gruden gets the opportunity to upgrade at the quarterback position with a player like Stafford, we suspect he’ll take it.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Cleveland Browns</h2>
[caption id="attachment_885846" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Johnny-Manziel-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885846" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Johnny-Manziel-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Johnny Manziel #2 tries to escape the pocket" width="757" height="505" /></a> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

We would love to see the Cleveland Browns give Johnny Manizel the opportunity to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-why-the-browns-need-to-stick-with-johnny-manziel.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">remain the team’s starting quarterback</a>., if only to watch the trainwreck. Even if coach Mike Pettine gave him another shot in 2016, there’s no guarantee Manziel would do enough to win himself the job. On the flip side, while Josh McCown has done admirably as the team’s starting quarterback, including a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201510110rav.htm" target="_blank">457-yard performance against the Baltimore Ravens</a>, he is 36 years old. Not exactly a spring chicken. Given these limited options, we think the Browns could easily carve out a place for  Matthew Stafford in Cleveland.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_885845" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-York-Jets-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885845" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-York-Jets-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="New York Jets celebrate a touchdown" width="757" height="563" /></a> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

We’ve enjoyed watching journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick quarterback the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nyj/2015.htm" target="_blank">New York Jets</a> and bring some consistency to an oftentimes floundering offense, but we don’t see him as the long-term solution at the position. First-year head coach Todd Bowles already has himself some quality pieces to work with. The Jets’ defensive line is young, hungry, and only going to get better. New York also has a legit receiving corp in <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/players/7868/" target="_blank">Brandon Marshall</a>, Eric Decker, and Devin Smith (he’ll get there, trust us). All that’s missing is a quality quarterback to tie it all together. There’s no reason to think Matthew Stafford can’t be that guy.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_885847" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-885847" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning reacts after an incomplete pass" width="757" height="467" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Every list needs a wild card. This is ours.

The Broncos  have the nastiest defense in the NFL and look like a legitimate Super Bowl contender. However, if this group does end up hoisting the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season, it won’t be because of the outstanding play of quarterback <a href="http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/roster/Peyton-Manning/5e49338e-cd44-4226-9451-f111c0eb767d" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a>.

By the looks of it, age and injuries have finally seemed to catch up to one of the greatest QBs of his generation. Through seven games, Manning has thrown just seven touchdown passes to go along with 11 interceptions. This is not the guy we’re used to seeing. Perhaps we never will again.

The idea of Matthew Stafford going to the Denver Broncos is predicated on the notion that the great Peyton Manning calls it a career at the end of 2015. If he decides to give it a go next season, we don’t see Stafford as a Bronco. However, if Manning concludes that the time is right to ride off into the sunset, we think <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/johnelway/2500547/profile" target="_blank">John Elway</a> would love to see what Denver can do with a guy like Stafford. After all, we know how much he loves quarterbacks with a rocket arm.

		<description><![CDATA[With Super Bowl 50 now in the rearview mirror, it's time to turn our attention to pro football's next major event: the 2016 NFL draft.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_943145" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NFL-Draft-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-943145" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NFL-Draft-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="505" /></a> The on-screen announcement that the Chicago Bears picked Kevin White of the West Virginia Mountaineers during the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft. | Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

It didn’t hit us until after we watched the confetti fall on the heads of the Denver Broncos players following their Super Bowl victory that we were now faced with an undeniable truth: The 2015 NFL season is officially over. And for just one second, we were literally (and a little melodramatically) as sad as all those poor souls who <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/super-bowl-5-big-chokes-from-the-past.html/" target="_blank">choked on the stage of Super Bowls past</a>. But then we quickly cheered up because we remembered that we can now turn all our attention to another key event: the 2016 NFL draft.

Now that the Lombardi Trophy has been lifted into the air, the order for this year’s draft is officially complete. As a result, we can throw out our <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-draft-2016-post-divisional-round-mock-draft.html/" target="_blank">previous mock draft</a> and begin with something fresh and current. Of course, as we continue our thorough examination of this year’s potential draftees, our predictions are subject to change. Here’s a look at our (Post-Super Bowl) 2016 NFL mock draft.
<h2>1. Tennessee Titans: Laremy Tunsil, OT, Ole Miss</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931387" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Laremy-Tunsil-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931387" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Laremy-Tunsil-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="544" /></a> Laremy Tunsil, No. 78, of the Mississippi Rebels | Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

The Tennessee Titans could go in a few different directions with their No. 1 overall pick. However, we continue to believe — just as we did following the divisional round of the playoffs — that solidifying the O-line makes the most amount of success. If Marcus Mariota is going to be the Titans’ franchise quarterback (and we have every reason to believe that he is), then the front office better step up and use this selection to protect their most important player. And that means drafting Ole Miss tackle Laremy Tunsil.

With his massive 6-foot-5, 305-pound frame, the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/laremy-tunsil-1.html" target="_blank">junior standout</a> is big, strong, and — per draft expert Mel Kiper’s evaluation up to this point (subscription required) — the <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2016/insider/story/_/id/14385480/joey-bosa-top-robert-nkemdiche-drops-mel-kiper-2016-big-board-nfl-draft" target="_blank">top pass-blocker in the draft</a>. It’s time for the Titans to protect Mariota’s blind side. As far as the 2016 draft is concerned, no one will do that better than Laremy Tunsil.

<h2>2. Cleveland Browns: Carson Wentz, QB, North Dakota State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_943150" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Carson-Wentz-Michael-Chang-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-943150" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Carson-Wentz-Michael-Chang-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="504" /></a> Carson Wentz of North Dakota State | Michael Chang/Getty Images[/caption]

In our earlier mock draft, we had the Cleveland Browns selecting Cal quarterback Jared Goff. We still believe the Browns need to select a QB with their No. 2 overall pick, however, now we’re leaning toward a different gunslinger: North Dakota State’s Carson Wentz. Not only does Wentz have the <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/515607/carson-wentz" target="_blank">build of a prototypical quarterback</a> (he’s 6-foot-6, 235 pounds), but after lighting up the competition at the Senior Bowl, he also demonstrates that he has <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000629797/article/carson-wentz-solidifies-standing-as-firstrounder-at-senior-bowl" target="_blank">first-round talent</a> despite playing college ball at an FCS school.

Trust us, the question of whether or not Wentz could handle himself against the country’s top players was easily the biggest concern surrounding the quarterback. The Cleveland Browns forced us to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-is-it-time-to-take-the-cleveland-browns-seriously.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">start taking them seriously</a> after they hired Hue Jackson to be their new head coach. And when discussing the upcoming draft, Jackson said the following: “If there is a QB at No. 2 that is a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000624126/article/hue-jackson-browns-need-to-go-get-qb-with-no-2-pick-in-draft" target="_blank">best fit for our team</a>, we need to go get him. It’s my opinion we need a QB.” Well, in our opinion, that quarterback is Carson Wentz.

<h2>3. San Diego Chargers: Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931405" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joey-Bosa-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931405" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joey-Bosa-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="505" /></a> Joey Bosa of the Ohio State Buckeyes | Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Ohio State defensive end Joey Bosa may not be on the board when the San Diego Chargers pick at No. 3. However, if he is, they should take him immediately. Bosa is No. 1 on <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2016/insider/story/_/id/14385480/joey-bosa-top-robert-nkemdiche-drops-mel-kiper-2016-big-board-nfl-draft" target="_blank">Mel Kiper’s Big Board</a> (subscription required) and we don’t expect that to change anytime soon. The reason: He’s a monster.

At 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, this <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/joey-bosa-1.html" target="_blank">two-time consensus All-American</a> is powerful, versatile, and practically impossible to block one-on-one. Bosa is a dominant pass rusher and an undeniable game-changer. This is one who the Chargers shouldn’t even have to think about.

<h2>4. Dallas Cowboys: Myles Jack, LB, UCLA</h2>
[caption id="attachment_943159" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Myles-Jack-Otto-Greule-Jr-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-943159" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Myles-Jack-Otto-Greule-Jr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="585" /></a> Myles Jack of the UCLA Bruins | Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images[/caption]

Another team that could go in multiple directions are the Dallas Cowboys. And while we took a look at the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/32for32x160114/biggest-2016-draft-needs-every-nfl-team" target="_blank">club’s biggest needs</a> and originally decided that upgrading the secondary was the best play, we now believe that increasing the talent at the linebacker position may be the better move. Which is why we think the Cowboy’s should take <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/myles-jack-1.html" target="_blank">UCLA’s Myles Jack</a>.

Despite suffering a season-ending knee injury back in September, Jack is versatile, athletic, and explosive. He is tough, mobile, and has the speed to cover a lot of ground. Also, he is <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/pac12/post/_/id/97361/former-ucla-lb-myles-jack-has-sights-set-on-nfl-combine" target="_blank">preparing to showcase the goods</a> at the upcoming NFL combine. If he performs like we expect him to, there’s no reason why the Cowboys should let this former UCLA stud fall past them at No. 4.
<h2>5. Jacksonville Jaguars: Jalen Ramsey, S/CB, Florida State</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931408" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jalen-Ramsey-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931408" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jalen-Ramsey-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="NFL Draft 2016: Post-Super Bowl Mock Draft" width="757" height="547" /></a> Jalen Ramsey of the Florida State Seminoles | Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

Like we said before, in 2015, the Jacksonville Jaguars were <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/jax/2015.htm" target="_blank">last in the league in points allowed</a> (448 points and 28.0/g) and 29th in passing yards (4,291). Looking at these figures, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Jags target <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/32for32x160114/biggest-2016-draft-needs-every-nfl-team" target="_blank">a pass rusher</a>. However, that was before Florida State’s Jalen Ramsey fell into their laps.

Ramsey is an unrivaled athletic specimen. This multipurpose DB can shutdown receivers as a cornerback or cover in space as a safety. At <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/jalen-ramsey-1.html" target="_blank">6-foot-1, 202 pounds</a>, he’s rangy, instinctive, and knows how to bring the wood. This is exactly the kind of player who Gus Bradley and the Jacksonville Jaguars need.

		<description><![CDATA[Will Ray Rice get another shot in 2016? If so, one of these 4 teams may be the one to give him a chance.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_694189" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-694189" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ray-Rice-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images" width="757" height="479" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Ray Rice, any chance to return to the NFL is a good chance, as it seems that he <a title="may be all but finished" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-ray-rice-get-a-second-chance.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">may be all but finished</a> due to the domestic violence off-field issue he had. Rice was cut by the Baltimore Ravens back in September 2014 and has yet to receive another chance to play since then. Unfortunately, it seems as though he won&#8217;t get another chance, unless some team with a drastic need at running back comes along, willing to deal with the backlash of signing Rice. So, who are the suitors? There has to be someone, right? Of course, and the rumors will come during the 2016 offseason. With that said, let&#8217;s look at four teams that may be desperate enough to sign Rice and bring him back into the NFL.</p>
<h2>4. Indianapolis Colts</h2>
<p>We aren&#8217;t really sure we even want to jump on board with the Colts, so they rank as a distant No. 4 on this list. While the Colts do have Frank Gore, who is set to turn 33 before the season, there&#8217;s no denying he had <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GoreFr00.htm" target="_blank">a bit of a statistical drop-off</a> in 2015. Gore rushed for 967 yards and six scores, but averaged just 3.7 yards per carry, the worst of his entire career. Gore will still be the man for the Colts in 2016, but there is a real chance they will look to add some depth behind Gore. Rice would actually make for a great fit. Adding him would be an excellent way to ease him back into the NFL, and he wouldn&#8217;t be in the immediate spotlight, which is ideal.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Detroit Lions</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_843228" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-843228 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Joique-Bell-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ronald Martinez/Getty Images during the NFC Wildcard Playoff Game at AT&amp;T Stadium on January 4, 2015 in Arlington, Texas." width="757" height="504" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Heading into the 2015 season, everyone was ready to crown Ameer Abdullah as the future star of the NFL. Unfortunately, things didn&#8217;t pan out in his rookie year. Abdullah <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AbduAm00.htm" target="_blank">rushed for 597 yards</a>, caught 25 passes for 183 yards, and had three total scores. He also lost two fumbles &#8212; not the workhorse back that fans had hoped he&#8217;d become. To make things worse, when Lions running back Joique Bell wasn&#8217;t hurt, he was massively unproductive, averaging 3.5 yards per carry while totaling 311 yards and four touchdowns this season.</p>
<p>Bell has one year left on his contract with the Lions, so there&#8217;s plenty of reason to believe that some type of change could come. We still believe that Abdullah will be Detroit&#8217;s running back of the future, but Rice coming in as a backup or even a short-term starter may be the best move for the organization. It may not be the most popular signing right away, but Rice can add some power to the run game in Detroit.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Cleveland Browns</h2>
<p>This past season, rookie Duke Johnson Jr. was a strong option in the passing game for the Browns, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnDu00.htm" target="_blank">catching 61 balls for 534 yards</a> and two scores. Unfortunately, he rushed for just 379 yards with a 3.6 yard per carry average. Granted, on the depth chart, Johnson was behind Isaiah Crowell, who didn&#8217;t produce all that well either, finishing up the season with 706 yards and four touchdowns on the ground.</p>
<p>Basically, the running game in Cleveland is still completely up in the air right now. Whether Crowell or Johnson are able to come through is unknown, and the Browns also need a quarterback, so that may be their focus during the 2016 NFL draft. So, how about a free agent option? Maybe, say, Ray Rice? Yes, there are some intriguing free agents at the running back position, but Rice would be inexpensive and could provide some power in the backfield for a team who desperately needs it.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>1. Houston Texans</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_726712" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-726712" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Alfred-Blue.jpg" alt="Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>According to Sports Illustrated, Arian Foster may be <a title="on his way out the door" href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2016/01/14/houston-texans-expected-release-arian-foster" target="_blank">on his way out the door</a> in Houston this offseason. So, this means that the Texans will look for a new running back. With free agency loaded with options and a draft of intriguing, young talent, they wouldn&#8217;t possibly look to add Rice, would they? Why not? Rice would bring experience into a backfield of young runners and help take some of the pressure off Brian Hoyer and the passing game. This is a low-risk, high-reward situation for the Texans, as Rice would be playing with a chip on his shoulder.</p>
<p>If/when the Texans really do part ways with Foster, it&#8217;ll leave Alfred Blue and Jonathan Grimes as the two backs in town. Blue averaged 3.8 yards per carry this past season, while scoring two touchdowns on the ground and finishing with just 698 yards. Grimes was more impressive while averaging five yards per carry, but he only had 56 rushing attempts. He finished with 282 yards and two total touchdowns (one receiving). Don&#8217;t count the Texans out when considering their options at running back this offseason.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here's a look at how Calvin Johnson and Marshawn Lynch's early retirements could become the norm.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_811212" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-811212 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Barry-Sanders_JEFF-KOWALSKY-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Marshawn Lynch and Calvin Johnson May Have Just Changed the NFL" width="757" height="690" /> Barry Sanders | Jeff Kowalsky/Getty Images[/caption]

About 18 years ago, 30-year-old Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders abruptly announced that he would retire from football, leaving the game when he was still seemingly one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-10-greatest-nfl-running-backs-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">greatest to ever grace a backfield</a>. This pronouncement left the Lions organization and fans in shock. After all, in just 10 seasons, the star tailback had never failed to reach the 1,000-yard mark.

So, when news broke a few weeks ago that Lions’ wide receiver <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14686284/calvin-johnson-told-detroit-lions-plans-retire" target="_blank">Calvin Johnson would retire</a>, Lions fans — or at least those who remembered Sanders’ retirement — had a familiar feeling. Coincidentally, “Megatron,” as he was aptly named during his career, is also <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnCa00.htm" target="_blank">30 years old</a>. And he appears to have just as much good football left in him as Sanders did 18 years ago.

While there’s still some speculation about whether or not Johnson will actually hang up the spikes when push comes to shove, his retirement announcement wasn’t the only one to shake things up. Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch announced <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2016/02/08/marshawn-lynch-retires-seattle-beast-mode/79995916/" target="_blank">his plans to retire during the Super Bowl</a>. Lynch, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LyncMa00.htm" target="_blank">who’s 29</a> and just a year younger than Johnson, did struggle with injuries this past season, but he could still make an impact on most NFL rosters.

Assuming that these two players stick with their retirement claims, the game will lose two offensive weapons. Both Johnson and Lynch changed their respective positions; Lynch, combining his crushing style of running with speed and agility, and Johnson using his sheer size and speed to not just outrun and out-jump opposing defenses, but to be the most athletic player on the field in almost every game, too.

The only question that remains is why? To start, Lynch was hampered with nagging injuries for the majority of last season, and Johnson experienced more than a few bumps and bruises throughout his career. Lynch started just six games for Seattle in 2015, and when he was finally healthy enough to return for the playoffs — a strategic move by the Seahawks — he didn’t look the same. And though Johnson has only missed nine games in his career, it seems like every season he’s limited from week to week due to injuries.

Given the workloads these two players had in front of them, this shouldn’t come as a surprise. Whether it was the battering that Lynch took in the trenches — his running style didn’t help his cause — or the various big hits Johnson took coming across the middle, they drew a lot of attention as the focal points of their respective offenses.

Despite NFL players regularly competing while hobbled, Lynch and Johnson have apparently weighed their options and decided it’s just not worth it anymore. And as we know, they can still compete and hold their own on the gridiron — being 29 or 30 years old isn’t too far past their prime — but the health repercussions seem to be an obvious answer.

With the current trend of concussion-related fears and uncertainties about what a decade's worth of football really does to an athlete, there’s no doubt that NFL players have seemingly become more cautious concerning their bodies. Whereas Sanders might have been before his time in that regard, Johnson and Lynch may be the beginning of a more common practice.

Instead of letting the game dictate their retirement — retiring when they physically can’t play any longer or when no team will take them because of decreased production — Lynch and Johnson went out on their own accord. Maybe both players were used to competing at a high level and realized they might not be there anymore, so they decided to retire. That’s certainly plausible. But it doesn’t seem likely.

Both players, if healthy, showed that they can still put up impressive numbers as major game-changers. It’s not that they decided they couldn’t impact games anymore; they just decided they don’t <em>want</em> the repercussions to impact their lives anymore. And thus, the more health-conscious NFL players become, the more early retirements we may see moving forward.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_942557" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Super-Bowl-50_Jason-O.-Watson_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-942557" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Super-Bowl-50_Jason-O.-Watson_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jason O.

<p>For the Denver Broncos and the Carolina Panthers, what happens at Levi&#8217; Stadium on February 7 will determine which team hoists the Lombardi Trophy at Super Bowl 50. For the rest of us &#8212; and that includes <a title="Panthers vs Broncos: 7 Celebrities Who Support These Teams" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/panthers-vs-broncos-7-celebrities-who-support-these-teams.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">these seven celebrity supporters</a> &#8212; what happens on the field will have a more substantial impact on our wallets. <a title="AMERICANS TO BET $4.2 BILLION ON SUPER BOWL 50" href="https://www.americangaming.org/newsroom/press-releasess/americans-bet-42-billion-super-bowl-50" target="_blank">According to the American Gaming Association</a>, roughly $4.2 billion will be wagered, most of it illegally, on Super Bowl 50.</p>
<p>One of the more lighthearted and fun ways to place a wager on the Super Bowl is to take action on one (or more) of the many prop bets that are available at sportsbooks all over the world. With Super Bowl Sunday now just days away, we decided to sort through the hundreds of available prop bets and see what wild things we could bet on before, during, and after the game. Here’s our take on the 15 craziest prop bets that are available for Super Bowl 50.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>1. How long will it take Lady Gaga to sing the U.S. National Anthem?</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_942558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-942558" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Lady-Gaga_Kevin-Winter_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin Winter/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Kevin Winter/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under: </em></strong> 136.5 seconds</p>
<p>If the history of National Anthem performances during past Super Bowls is any indication, our guess is that the six-time Grammy award winner&#8217;s rendition goes well over 136.5 seconds.</p>
<h2>2. How many viewers (in millions) will Super Bowl 50 have?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:</em></strong> 117</p>
<p>Given that the Super Bowl has evolved into much more than just another sporting event, our guess is that there will be well over 117 million viewers on Sunday night.</p>
<h2>3. What will the Nielsen TV Rating be for Super Bowl 50?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:</em></strong>  47.5</p>
<p>If this game is still in question going into the fourth quarter, expect its Nielsen TV Rating to be well over 47.5.</p>
<h2>4. Who will the Super Bowl MVP thank first?</h2>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Coaches/owner: 12-1</li>
<li>Does not thank anyone or mention anyone on list: 2-1</li>
<li>Family: 8-1</li>
<li>Fans/city: 15-2</li>
<li>God: 13-10</li>
<li>Teammates: 2-1</li>
</ul>
<p>This really depends on the player. There could be yet <a title="NFL: 5 Super Bowl MVPs Who Surprised Everyone" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-most-unlikely-super-bowl-mvps-of-all-time.html/" target="_blank">another unforeseen MVP</a> in Super Bowl 50, or it could end up being Cam Newton or Peyton Manning just as the <a title="Super Bowl 50: Who Vegas is Picking to Win MVP" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/super-bowl-50-who-vegas-is-picking-to-win-mvp.html/" target="_blank">oddsmakers in Las Vegas, Nev.</a> expect.</p>
<h2>5. What color will the liquid be that is dumped on the head coach of the winning team?</h2>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Blue: 9/4</li>
<li>Clear: 5/1</li>
<li>Green: 10/1</li>
<li>Orange: Even</li>
<li>Purple: 10/1</li>
<li>Red: 8/1</li>
<li>Yellow: 11/2</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing your research for this bet, our suggestion would be to find out Newton and Manning&#8217;s favorite flavors of Gatorade.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>6. If Cam Newton scores a rushing touchdown what will he do first?</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_904881" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-904881" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cam-Newton_Streeter-Lecka_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="473" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dances solo: 2-1</li>
<li>Dances with teammates: 12-1</li>
<li>Dunks off FG post: 50-1</li>
<li>Goes to crowd and gives ball away: 2-1</li>
<li>Hands ball to NFL game official: 40-1</li>
<li>Open shirt Superman motion: 6-5</li>
<li>Spikes ball: 25-1</li>
</ul>
<p>This much we know: Newton will dance and celebrate if he finds his way into the end zone regardless of the game&#8217;s score.</p>
<h2>7. Will Mike Carey be wrong about a challenge?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Odds:  </em></strong>1.35-1</p>
<p>We would like to think that Carey can be correct on every challenge with the technology that is available to him, but who really knows?</p>
<h2>8. How many times will &#8220;dab" or &#8220;dabbing" be said by the announcers during the broadcast?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:</em></strong> 2</p>
<p>Considering the broadcasting team, a more appropriate bet might be &#8220;how many times will the announcers misuse the words &#8216;dab&#8217; or &#8216;dabbing?'"</p>
<h2>9. How many wings will Buffalo Wild Wings sell on Super Bowl Sunday (in millions)?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:</em></strong> 12</p>
<p>Judging by the over/under in this bet, we would recommend buying stock in Buffalo Wild Wings as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>10. If Stephen Curry is shown on TV during the broadcast what will he be wearing?</h2>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Personalized Carolina Steph Curry jersey: Even</li>
<li>Cam Newton jersey: 3-1</li>
<li>Any other Carolina jersey: 5-1</li>
<li>No jersey: 2-1</li>
</ul>
<p>If Curry is at the game, you can rest assured that he will be shown on TV during the broadcast.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>11. Will Peyton Manning be seen crying at any point during the entire broadcast?</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_935632" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-935632" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Peyton-Manning_Justin-Edmonds_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Justin Edmonds/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Yes: 6-1</li>
<li>No: 1-12</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears as though the oddsmakers are banking on Manning announcing his retirement at the conclusion of the game on Sunday night.</p>
<h2>12. Which song will Coldplay play first during the halftime show?</h2>
<h2><em>Odds:</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>Adventure of a Lifetime: 2-1</li>
<li>Fix You: 3.5-1</li>
<li>A Sky Full of Stars: 4.5-1</li>
<li>Viva La Vida: 5-1</li>
<li>Clocks: 7.5-1</li>
<li>Head Full of Dreams: 10-1</li>
<li>Paradise: 10-1</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as they put on a good show, who really cares?</p>
<h2>13. Will there be an earthquake during the game?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Odds:</em></strong>  10-1</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope that the answer is no.</p>
<h2>14. How many times will John Elway be shown on TV during the broadcast?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:  </em></strong>2.5</p>
<p>We&#8217;re guessing the over is the smart play here, regardless of how this game plays out.</p>
<h2>15. How many times will the Golden Gate Bridge be shown during the broadcast?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Over/Under:</em></strong>  0.5</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have a Super Bowl in the Bay Area without showing the Golden Gate Bridge at least once, right?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It appears that the Seattle Seahawks are likely done with Marshawn Lynch. If that's the case, here's a look at 3 potential landing spots for Beast Mode in 2016.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_931219" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Marshawn-Lynch-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931219" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Marshawn-Lynch-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Marshawn Lynch puts his helmet on during the Divisional round game against the Panthers" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

For the first time since the 2012 season, an NFC team that’s not the Seattle Seahawks will represent in the Super Bowl. If that seems strange, you might want to strap yourself in. There’s a strong possibility that even more change is in the air. According to Zach Whitman of SB Nation’s Field Gulls, ESPN.com’s John Clayton reports that running back Marshawn Lynch is “<a href="https://twitter.com/zjwhitman/status/689105905984630784" target="_blank">absolutely, 100%</a>" done in Seattle. Sorry, Beast Mode fans.

As hard as this news may be to swallow, if you ask us, it makes perfect sense. At this moment, Lynch is 29 years old — he’ll be 30 in April — and he was only healthy enough to play in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LyncMa00.htm" target="_blank">seven games this season</a>. Not only are these two large strikes against him, but he’s also scheduled to make <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/seattle-seahawks/marshawn-lynch/" target="_blank">$9 million next season</a>, which amounts to $11.5 million against the cap in 2016. That will not be worth it for Seattle. If they cut the five-time Pro Bowler, it would only cost them a cap hit of $5 million, essentially saving them $6.5 million in cap space.

Plus, in Thomas Rawls, the Seahawks have a younger, less expensive, and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RawlTh00.htm" target="_blank">capable back</a> to replace the aging Beast Mode. The numbers paint a pretty clear picture; one that doesn’t involve Marshawn Lynch in Seattle in 2016. Of course, the way we see it, Lynch still has a few good years left in him. Therefore, plenty of teams will probably show interest in his services. With that in mind, if Lynch is truly done in Seattle, here’s a look at three spots the powerful running back could land in 2016.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931233" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Darren-McFadden-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931233" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Darren-McFadden-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Darren McFadden #20 of the Dallas Cowboys runs the ball past Will Blackmon #41 of the Washington Redskins" width="757" height="498" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

Considering DeMarco Murray’s recent season with the Philadelphia Eagles, you can’t fault the Dallas Cowboys for not wanting to shell out big bucks for the former rushing champion. That said, the Cowboys’ use of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/2015.htm" target="_blank">running back by committee</a> in 2015 was hardly as effective as the team hoped. While Darren McFadden was a reliable option for The Boys, rushing for 1,089 yards on 239 carries, Dallas only managed eight rushing touchdowns (21st in the NFL). Lynch wouldn’t be a long-term solution. However, we saw what happens in Big D when superstars Tony Romo and Dez Bryant go down with injuries. Should that happen again, having Beast Mode in the backfield would soften the blow.

<h2>2. Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931245" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Latavius-Murray-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931245" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Latavius-Murray-Brian-Bahr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Running back Latavius Murray #28 of the Oakland Raiders gets a series of carries against the Green Bay Packers" width="757" height="642" /></a> Brian Bahr/Getty Images[/caption]

Despite finishing the 2015 regular season <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings" target="_blank">third in the AFC West</a> with a 7-9 record, it’s clear that Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio has a solid, young core brewing in Oakland. Quarterback Derek Carr is a Pro Bowler in the making; wide receiver Amari Cooper proves to be polished beyond his years; and running back Latavius Murray — with <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MurrLa00.htm" target="_blank">1,066 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns</a> in 2015 — is well on his way to being a stud. While it may seem unnecessary to bring in someone like Lynch when you have all this talent, the Raiders would be wise to consider it.

First and foremost, it never hurts to lighten the load at the running back position. And with Lynch in the fold, the Raiders wouldn’t be forced to rely so much on their young back. Plus, having the one-two punch of Murray and Lynch would add more firepower to the unit, giving the Raiders another potent piece on the offensive side of the ball. Throw in the fact that Lynch’s <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000464640/article/marshawn-lynchs-oakland-ties-reveal-seahawks-stars-spirit" target="_blank">Oakland ties are important</a> to him and the team’s <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/research/nfl/nfl-2016-team-financial-power-rankings-562/" target="_blank">healthy financial situation</a> in 2016, and it seems like a no-brainer to bring Beast Mode back to the Bay Area.

<h2>3. New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_931260" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931260" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tom-Brady-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady #12 of the New England Patriots signals in the second half against the Kansas City Chiefs" width="757" height="505" /></a> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to bringing out the best in aging running backs, no team does it better than the New England Patriots. If the opportunity presents itself for Bill Belichick to bring in Lynch, it would hardly surprise us to see him get the deal done. Aside from the obvious benefit of having a force like Lynch in the backfield, the Pats will also be relatively thin at the position in 2016.

Breakout back Dion Lewis is <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-england-patriots/dion-lewis/" target="_blank">under contract through 2017</a>, but he’ll need to bounce back from a torn ACL that forced him to miss much of the 2015 season. On top of that, running back LeGarrette Blount will <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-england-patriots/legarrette-blount/" target="_blank">become an unrestricted free agent</a> in 2016. Given these circumstances, it makes sense for Lynch to end up in New England. Plus, let’s be real, how entertaining would it be to have Rob Gronkowski and Beast Mode on the same team? You don’t need to respond. We already know the answer.

		<description><![CDATA[While Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton has emerged as one of the NFL's best players, it's his stylish press conference outfits that have truly made him a star.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_941724" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cam-Newton-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-941724" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cam-Newton-Thearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Quarterback Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panther addresses the media during media availability prior to Super Bowl 50" width="757" height="511" /></a> Thearon W.

<p>Thanks to his spectacular play during the 2015 <a href="http://www.nfl.com/ " target="_blank">NFL</a> season, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is destined to win this year&#8217;s MVP award. Yet, for all his brilliance on the gridiron, what&#8217;s actually managed to grab the people&#8217;s attention even more is his unabashed fashion sense. And when we think about how Newton has transformed himself into one of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/hub/the-cheat-sheets-10-most-stylish-male-athletes-of-2015/" target="_blank">most stylish athletes on the planet</a>, for us, it all begins with his press conference attire.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough for Newton to shine on the field, he has to crush it on the podium as well. It doesn&#8217;t matter what stage we&#8217;re talking about, our man Cam was born for it. He&#8217;s charming, playful, confident, and more than willing to push the envelope from a fashion standpoint. And not only do we commend him for his bold choices, but we think it&#8217;s only fitting that we take the time to acknowledge our favorite of his outfits.</p>
<p>As we prepare to see what Newton can do on the field against the Denver Broncos at <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/50" target="_blank">Super Bowl 50</a>, here&#8217;s a look at five occasions when, thanks to his bold outfits, he crushed it off the field at the postgame press conferences.</p>

<h2>1. Cam goes bowtie</h2>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>This is a tough outfit to pull off, but if anyone can, it&#8217;s Newton. With his light blue jacket, pink bowtie, and colorful pocket square, the Panthers quarterback has the look of an individual who&#8217;s so comfortable in his own skin that he&#8217;ll wear whatever he wants. And if we were in Newton&#8217;s position, we&#8217;d feel the exact same way.         <!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Cam goes casual</h2>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
This sweater is not for everyone. But as we&#8217;ve learned on many occasions, Newton isn&#8217;t just anyone. He&#8217;s an absolute rock star. The pattern may be a bit crazy, but he definitely makes it work. Plus, when it&#8217;s cold outside, sometimes you just want to sport something that&#8217;s cozy and comfortable. And by the looks of it, this sweater certainly fits the criteria.</p>

<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>If you ask us, never before has a postgame press conference felt so formal. But you know what, we dig it. This look is sleek, polished, and 100% refined. Whether Newton is talking to the media or planning to attend a gala afterwards, it really doesn&#8217;t matter. The superstar QB is ready for any occasion. Like an NFL version of James Bond, Newton is Double-O-Fresh.     <!--nextpage--></p>

We can&#8217;t think of anyone else who could pull off this jacket. Seriously, this is camouflage we&#8217;re talking about.

		<description><![CDATA[The Denver Broncos are looking to get to their second Super Bowl with Peyton Manning at the helm. Here's a look at 4 reasons why they can do it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since joining the Denver Broncos back in 2012, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-will-super-bowl-50-define-peyton-mannings-legacy.html/" target="_blank">Peyton Manning has come close</a> but has yet to win a Super Bowl with his new team. He’s won one in his career, but in what will likely be one of his final years in the NFL, the future Hall of Famer is hoping to get the Broncos out of the big game on top. While Denver has had a bit of an up-and-down season complete with Manning dealing with injuries throughout, he’s their man moving into the Super Bowl.

Making the plot even better? Manning overcame one of his biggest rivals in Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The Broncos finished the year with an impressive 12-4 record, but their offense wasn’t nearly as explosive as we’ve seen in the past. Manning played in just 10 games, but as a team, the Broncos saw their offense sputter at times.

With that said, the Broncos have proven to have one of the most talented defenses in the NFL this year, and that defense is going to play a large role in helping them win the 2016 Super Bowl. Let’s check out the four reasons why they can take home the trophy.
<h2>1. Leadership</h2>
[caption id="attachment_932056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-932056" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dustin Bradford/Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

Peyton Manning and DeMarcus Ware are two players who immediately come to mind. The two veterans are the leaders of their respective units, and figure to play a big role in Denver’s success whether it be on the field with big plays or simply helping to keep teammates focused in the games ahead.

There is possibly no better leader in the NFL than Manning, and simply having him out there seems to have electrified the Broncos on both sides of the ball. Manning may not be throwing for 500 yards a game and five touchdowns, but he’s more than talented enough to avoid turning the ball over in key moments, making smart reads and keeping his offense moving when it matters most.

As for Ware, he may be 33 and in the home stretch of his career, but he’s still playing well. In the divisional round victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ware had two tackles for loss and a sack, showing that he can still be a force for Denver’s defense. The pressure Ware applied to Brady late in the during the AFC Championship on key drives is evidence enough.

<h2>2. Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_829166" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-829166 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Demaryius-Thomas_Emmanuel-Sanders_Justin-Edmonds_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Justin Edmonds/Getty Images" width="757" height="552" /> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

Manning’s two favorite targets without question are Thomas and Sanders, who combined for 16 targets in the divisional round victory. While they combined for just nine catches for 125 yards, the fact that they are reliable and consistent targets for Manning is what makes all the difference.

When you have two receivers who have topped 1,100 yards and have 12 combined touchdowns, it’s obvious that they’re going to play a huge role. It’ll be even more important to utilize these two players simply due to the fact that all three remaining teams have high-flying offenses who can put major points on the board.

Expect to see a lot of Thomas and Sanders in Super Bowl 50.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Shutdown secondary</h2>
[caption id="attachment_818076" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-818076 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chris-Harris_Justin-Edmonds_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Justin Edmonds/Getty Images" width="757" height="545" /> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

When looking at the numbers, it’s obvious that the Broncos have one of the best defenses in the NFL, but let’s start it off with their secondary. One number stands out and is absolutely unreal to think about in the pass-heavy league that the NFL has become.

Seven.

The Broncos have allowed exactly seven touchdowns to opposing wide receivers over the 16 regular season games. That’s almost unreal to think about, but to make it even better, they are the only team in the NFL to allow less than 2,000 yards to opposing wide outs.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Incredible pass rush</h2>
[caption id="attachment_913328" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-913328" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Von-Miller-DeMarcus-Ware_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="529" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the span of the 2015 regular season, the Broncos led the league with a ridiculously impressive 52 sacks. In comparison, the team with the fewest sacks was the Atlanta Falcons, with 19. Denver gets pressure on opposing quarterbacks at a terrific rate, and that’s also a reason why the team has held opposing quarterbacks to a league-best 3,544 yards passing. Denver is also tied for the third-fewest touchdown passes allowed at 19 as well.

		<description><![CDATA[If star wideout Calvin Johnson has played his last game with the Detroit Lions, here are four teams he could suit up for next season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_876923" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-876923" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Calvin-Johnson_Leon-Halip_Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="After catching a touchdown" width="757" height="566" /> Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]

Detroit Lions star wide receiver Calvin Johnson wrapped up another strong campaign that helped him earn his sixth Pro Bowl selection in <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-3-biggest-moments-of-calvin-johnsons-career.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">his illustrious nine-year career</a>. It marked his sixth straight season with at least 1,000 receiving yards and 70 catches. However, the season finale 24-20 win over the Chicago Bears could also signal the end of his tenure with the Lions. Johnson is still one of the league’s top receivers, but the team could save $11.1 million on the cap by releasing him.

There’s also no hiding the fact that he’s now 30 years old. His production could dip as he enters the latter part of his career, which warrants the possibility of the team looking to either restructure his current deal or asking him to take a pay cut. If neither of those scenarios plays out, there is a strong chance that he will suit up elsewhere in 2016 -- <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14686284/calvin-johnson-told-detroit-lions-plans-retire" target="_blank">assuming he doesn't retire all together</a>. Since we don't want to imagine an NFL without him quite yet, here are four potential landing spots for Megatron next season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_903031" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-903031" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tom-Brady-Bill-Belichick_Jim-Rogash_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jim Rogash/Getty Images" width="757" height="576" /> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

As long as Bill Belichick and Tom Brady are at the helm, the Patriots will be a team in the conversation for possible upgrades to any position — aside from quarterback. First and foremost, if Johnson considers joining New England, he would likely have to take a pay cut as the franchise has a reputation for giving players fair deals that don’t often rank in the top of the league. Keep in mind that Brady restructured his deal last season to help provide the team with more cap space to spend on improving the team.

With Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, and Danny Amendola all at Brady’s disposal, Johnson’s addition to the team would make the Patriots an unstoppable offensive force. What also makes the Patriots a potential destination is that they acquired Randy Moss, another big-name receiver, from the Oakland Raiders. Moss also agreed to restructure his deal after being traded to New England. Yes, the Patriots won’t have much financial flexibility this upcoming year, but it would be foolish to count them out in any scenario.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2> 2. New York Giants</h2>
[caption id="attachment_799357" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-799357 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/New-York-Giants-Celebrate.jpg" alt="Elsa/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

The Giants have already started to undergo some major changes with the departure of longtime head coach Tom Coughlin, which could lead to more changes involving staff. With that in mind, the team possesses just over $40 million in cap space this upcoming offseason. Contracts with several notable players, such as Jason Pierre-Paul, Rueben Randle, Prince Amukamara, and Cullen Jenkins, are coming off the books. New York will likely use some of that money to bring back a few of those players, which would leave enough cap space for the team to try to acquire Johnson.

The move would fill a pressing need at wide receiver as the team has struggled to find a suitable wideout to play alongside their young star, Odell Beckham Jr. They hoped Victor Cruz would fill that void, but his struggles to recover from his leg injury put a huge question mark on his status. This move would also give Eli Manning arguably the best wide receiver duo in the league with two players who are in the top five at the position. If the Giants added New Orleans head coach Sean Payton, his pass-heavy offensive game plan would make the possibility of adding Johnson even greater.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. St. Louis Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_894268" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-894268" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Todd-Gurley_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images" width="757" height="739" /> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]

Over the past several years, the Rams have desperately needed to add a true No. 1 receiver. They will head into the offseason with over $40 million in salary cap space. However, there will be several tough decisions to make as big defensive players, such as Janoris Jenkins, Williams Hayes, Mark Barron, and Rodney McLeod, are set to become free agents. St. Louis will likely try to keep many of those players — especially Jenkins and Hayes — which will hurt their financial flexibility but should leave a significant amount of space to make moves.

This could make way for the team to possibly get involved in any potential trade talks for Johnson with the ability to absorb his massive contract. The Rams do have a huge issue at quarterback with Nick Foles proving to be a failed experiment in his first season with the team. This shouldn’t prevent them from trying to acquire Johnson as he would provide much needed reliability at wide receiver.

The move would be extremely beneficial for speedy wideout Tavon Austin as he can transition to playing primarily in the slot, where he has shown to be most productive and dangerous within the offense. St. Louis already has a solid foundation with rookie sensation Todd Gurley as the focal point of the offense. All in all, it may be a long shot for the Rams, but there’s no question that they have the financial means to get it done.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_856109" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-856109 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Aaron-Rodgers-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

If the Lions decide to cut Johnson in the offseason, one team that could snag the star wideout in free agency would be the Packers, who are expected to have roughly $23 million in cap space. That number should dip somewhat with notable players such as B.J. Raji and James Starks both scheduled to become free agents; Green Bay will likely make a concerted effort to re-sign them. But this should leave enough cap space for the Packers to make a run at Johnson (if he’s willing to take a pay cut to play for one of the top NFC teams).

Throughout the first nine years of his career, the 30-year-old has played against them as divisional rivals. This would be a great matchup for both sides as Johnson would play for one of the game’s best quarterbacks in two-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers, who would utilize him to the best of his ability. If this season proved anything, the Packers desperately need another wide receiver as the team had its fair share of struggles without Jordy Nelson.

Johnson would provide the team with a receiver who can create separation at the line of scrimmage and step in as the team’s primary wide receiver. It would instantly make both Nelson and Randall Cobb more dangerous options in the passing game. It would also give Johnson the rare opportunity to stick it to the Lions at least twice a season. If Johnson is released and seriously considers taking a pay cut, the Packers could be a dark horse to land him. Green Bay was able to get Julius Peppers to take a significant pay cut to join the team, so why not Megatron?

		<description><![CDATA[We count down which eight passers have thrown the most career interceptions in NFL history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_703668" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703668 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/72804719-640x426.jpg" alt="Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

If you watched the New York Giants and Washington Redskins play on national television <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400554201" target="_blank">way back when last season</a>, you saw a forgettable performance by Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins, who threw not one, not two, not three, but four interceptions in an ugly 45-14 defeat. While Cousins had a miserable night, he still has a very long way to go to catch up to some of the most intercepted passers of all time.

Cousins’ otherwise uninspiring stat line at least inspired us to go through the archives and see exactly which NFL quarterbacks have thrown the most passes to the opposing team over the course of their careers. So here is a quick look back at the eight most intercepted passers in league history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>8. Dan Marino</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703664" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703664 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51652671-640x435.jpg" alt="Rhona Wise/Getty Images" width="757" height="514" /> Rhona Wise/Getty Images[/caption]

Miami Dolphins great Dan Marino threw 252 interceptions for the aqua and orange between 1983 and 1999. He <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=238&amp;tab=Highlights" target="_blank">set a team record</a> with 23 picks in 1986 and equaled it two years later, and his 22 interceptions <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MariDa00.htm" target="_blank">led the NFL</a> in 1989. Marino also threw five interceptions in a game twice (1988 versus the Jets and 1999 versus the Cowboys). Of course, all of this seems a little like nitpicking in a Hall of Fame career that featured over 61,000 passing yards and 420 touchdowns.
<h2>7. Johnny Unitas</h2>
John Constantine Unitas played professional football from 1956-1973, with all but one of those seasons for the Baltimore Colts. Over that time, Johnny U tossed 253 interceptions, including 24 picks in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/U/UnitJo00.htm" target="_blank">three</a> different years (1960, 1961, and 1966). Like Marino, Unitas obviously is known for much more than just the interceptions, as the Colts QB threw for over 40,000 yards in his career and was inducted into the <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=219" target="_blank">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1979.
<h2>6. Norm Snead</h2>
Norm Snead threw 257 interceptions during a career that spanned sixteen seasons and five franchises (Washington, Philadelphia, Minnesota, New York Giants, and San Francisco). He <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SneaNo00.htm" target="_blank">led the league</a> in INTs four different times, including 27 picks in 1973. In fact, Snead only threw more touchdowns than interceptions in four of his sixteen years in the pros.
<h2>5. Fran Tarkenton</h2>
Nine-time Pro Bowler Fran Tarkenton completed plenty of passes to his own team (3,686, to be exact), but also ranks in the top five all time for throws to the other team. Tarkenton was intercepted 266 times during his eighteen seasons with the Vikings, but actually <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TarkFr00.htm" target="_blank">led the league</a> in lowest percentage of passes picked during two different years (1973 and 1976). Tarkenton threw 32 interceptions, the worst in his career, in his final season.

<h2>4. Vinny Testaverde</h2>
[caption id="attachment_703659" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-703659 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/56000527-640x467.jpg" alt="Streeter Lecka/Getty Images" width="757" height="552" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]

Vinny Testaverde (pictured) threw 267 interceptions during his time in the NFL, a number slightly (and thankfully) surpassed by his total touchdown passes — he had 275 of those. Testaverde’s worst season interception-wise came in 1988, when he committed 35 turnovers through the air. The lowlight of that year had to be a game against Minnesota, when the then-Buccaneer signal-caller was picked off <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_int_single_game.htm" target="_blank">a half dozen times</a> in a 49-20 loss.
<h2>3. John Hadl</h2>
John Hadl threw for 3,473 yards and 27 touchdowns in 1968 for the Chargers, which is good, but he was also intercepted 32 times that season, the worst in his career, which is not so good. Hadl joined Testaverde in the ‘six picks in the same game’ club that year as well, tossing six interceptions against Kansas City. In all, Hadl threw 268 interceptions during his professional football career (1962-1977).
<h2>2. George Blanda</h2>
Six interceptions in a game? That’s not very impressive to George Blanda — he accomplished the ignoble feat three different times, twice in 1962 alone! Of course, Blanda played in 26 seasons <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BlanGe00.htm" target="_blank">from the ’40s to the ’70s</a>, so he was bound to throw a pick or two … or 277. Blanda’s 1962 season was nothing to write home about, as the Houston quarterback threw 42 interceptions in a single year. To put that into perspective, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_int_single_season.htm" target="_blank">no other QB</a> in history has thrown more than 35 in a season. Blanda was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1981, rewarding the quarterback/kicker who played in a <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=29" target="_blank">then-record</a> 340 games.
<h2>1. Brett Favre</h2>
Brett Favre is in a league all his own atop this list, throwing 336 all time interceptions (or 59 more than anyone else in history). On the bright side, Favre seemed to get better with age. Of the 19 seasons where he started a majority of his team’s games, only once did he throw a single-digit number of interceptions. That came at age 40 with the Vikings, when Favre was picked off just seven times <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FavrBr00.htm" target="_blank">in comparison</a> to 33 scoring passes. One of Favre’s worst games came in January 2002, when the Rams intercepted him six times and ran three back for touchdowns en route to an <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=220120014" target="_blank">NFC playoff win</a> over the Packers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Football season is more than half over, so it's almost time to start thinking about the playoffs. Or the draft, if you're a fan of a team who hasn't had a spectacular season so far.That sounds depressing, so why not pass the time by watching all of these films? Once you're done, it'll be about time to prepare yourself for the postseason.

Take a look at the eight top grossing football films of all time, unadjusted for inflation:
<h2 style="text-align: left">8. <em>Varsity Blues</em> – Paramount Pictures ($52.9 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527636" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Varsity-blues-Handout-by-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-527636 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Varsity-blues-Handout-by-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="569" /></a> Handout/Getty Images[/caption]

Paramount Pictures’ football drama <em>Varsity Blues</em> came out in 1999 and stars James Van Der Beek, Amy Smart, Paul Walker, and Jon Voight. The film tells the story of a small-town high school football team and the pressures of performing in a football-obsessed community.

Budgeted at an estimated $16 million, the film performed better than expected making $52 million at the domestic box office despite mixed reviews from critics. And if you’re like me, you probably remember the film best for slow motion shots set to “My Hero” by the Foo Fighters.

But all jokes aside, something about the film ultimately connected with audiences and many aspects of the film went on to become a part of the pop culture lexicon.

<h2 style="text-align: left">7. <em>Invincible</em> – Walt Disney Co. ($57.8 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_527637" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mark-Wahlberg-Bryan-Bedder-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-527637 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mark-Wahlberg-Bryan-Bedder-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="824" /></a> Brian Bedder/Getty Images[/caption]

One of the more recent films on this list, Walt Disney Co.’s <em>Invincible</em> came out in 2006 and stars Mark Wahlberg, Greg Kinnear, and Elizabeth Banks. The film is based on the true story of Vince Papale who played for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1976 to 1978 after catching the attention of coach Dick Vermeil at an open tryout.

With a budget of $40 million, the film’s box office take of almost $58 million didn’t make the film a big winner financially, but movie-goers and critics generally enjoyed the film. Robert Wilonsky of <em>Village Voice</em> <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-08-15/film/invincible/">wrote</a>, “One of the few satisfying sports movies in which the foundation built upon a heap of clichés holds strong,” and Michael Phillips of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> said that, “There’s a sugar coating to the way Papale’s story unfolds, but not so much that you’ll spoil your dinner.”

<h2 style="text-align: left">6. <em>Friday Night Lights</em> – Universal Pictures ($61.2 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513519" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/Friday-Night-Lights.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513519 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Friday-Night-Lights.jpg" alt="(Source Universal) " width="757" height="426" /></a> Source: Universal[/caption]

Universal Pictures’ football drama <em>Friday Night Lights </em>arrived in theaters in 2004, starring Billy Bob Thornton, Derek Luke, and Jay Hernandez. The film was based on <i>Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream</i> written by H. G. Bissinger and tells the story of the 1988 Permian High School Panthers football team and their run towards the state championship.

The film later spawned a television series of the same name that ended in 2010 and there are now talks of a <a href="http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/08/19/get-ready-for-a-friday-night-lights-movie-based-on-the-tv-show-based-on-the-movie-based-on-the-book/">movie based on the TV show</a>. As many onlookers have humorously pointed out, that will mean that the new film will be based on a TV show, that was based on a film, that was based on a book. It almost sounds like the plot to <em>Inception</em>.

But as far as the raw numbers go, <em>Friday Night Lights</em> made $61 million at the box office on a budget of $30 million. The film is also one of the most critically acclaimed films on this list with many critics commending the film on not only its portrayal of football, but the overall dissection of small-town America. The late Roger Ebert <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/friday-night-lights-2004">wrote at the time</a> that, “The movie demonstrates the power of sports to involve us; we don’t live in Odessa and are watching a game played 16 years ago, and we get all wound up,” giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars.

<h2 style="text-align: left">5. <em>Any Given Sunday</em> – Warner Bros. ($75.5 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513523" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/Any-Given-Sunday.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513523 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Any-Given-Sunday.jpg" alt="SOurce: Warner Bros." width="757" height="503" /></a> Source: Warner Bros.[/caption]

Released on December 22, 1999, the Warner Bros. football drama <em>Any Given Sunday</em> is probably the most serious film on this list. Directed by Oliver Stone with an ensemble cast including Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, and Jamie Foxx, the film depicts a fictional professional American football team, the Miami Sharks, and the turmoil surrounding the team both on the field and behind the scenes in ownership.

With a production budget of $55 million, <em>Any Given Sunday</em> went on to make $75 million domestically and $24 million in foreign markets — an impressive number given that football films generally garner under 5 percent of their total gross outside the United States. <em>Any Given Sunday</em> got a mixed reception when it was released in 1999, with some critics saying that while it had great moments, it wasn’t up to the standard of Stone’s previous efforts.

J. Hoberman of<em> Village Voice, </em>for example, <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-12-21/film/end-games/">wrote</a> that the film felt like “A Visual Concussion.” And while he meant that negatively, other critics seem to indicate that the experience that Hoberman is keying in on is a positive. “One of the few football movies that really puts you in the action, conveying the ferocity and trauma of the game,” Michael Wilmington of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> wrote.<strong>  </strong>While the reviews at the time show a huge discrepancy between critics, the film has garnered somewhat of a cult following in more recent years, with many calling it one of, if not the greatest football movie ever made.

<h2 style="text-align: left">4. <em>Remember the Titans</em> – Walt Disney Co. ($115.6 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513526" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/Remember-the-Titans.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513526 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Remember-the-Titans.jpg" alt="(Source Disney)" width="757" height="331" /></a> Source: Disney[/caption]

Arguably the feel-good movie of this list, Disney’s <em>Remember the Titans</em> came out in 2000 and stars Denzel Washington. Along with the backing of Disney and the box office draw of Washington, the film was also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. <em>Remember the Titans</em> tells the true story of an African-American coach who who tries to introduce a racially divided team at the T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia during the early 1970′s.

<em>Remember the Titans</em> ended up making $115 million domestically, along with a foreign total of $21 million. The film ended up being a huge financial success for Disney as the film’s budget was estimated to be about $30 million. While some critics felt that the film was too sentimental, the greater majority felt that the film ultimately didn’t fall victim to over-sentimentality.

Andrew O’Hehir of <em>Salon</em> wrote, “Taken on its own terms, it’s an agreeable entertainment, solidly crafted, wonderfully acted and often genuinely moving,” while A. O. Scott of the <em>NY Times</em> wrote, “Remember the Titans is similarly solid; its satisfactions are time-tested, a little worn but nonetheless durable.” The general consensus among viewers seems to be that, while the film is sentimental, who cares?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left">3. <em>The Longest Yard</em> – Paramount Pictures ($158.1 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513528" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/The-Longest-Yard-1024x682.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513528 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Longest-Yard-1024x682.jpg" alt="(Source Paramount)" width="757" height="504" /></a> source: Paramount[/caption]

<em>The Longest Yard</em> is a remake of the 1974 film of the same and stars Adan Sandler, Chris Rock, and James Cromwell. The film is the story of a disgraced former professional quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers in prison who is forced to form a team of prison inmates to play football against the prison guards.

The Paramount-backed football film ended up making $158 million domestically and $32 million at the foreign box office — good thing too, because the film had a budget of $82 million. Among other top rankings aside from football films, <em>The Longest Yard</em> also ranks number one on the list of remakes and number two in sports comedy.

The critics had a mostly negative reception of the film, with most writing that the film was not as good as the original. “If you’re thinking of seeing it, and you’re old enough to drive (or even read this), do yourself a favor and rent the original instead,” Carina Chocano of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> wrote. However, Roger Ebert <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-longest-yard-2005">explained</a> that, “The Longest Yard more or less achieves what most of the people attending it will expect.” The film’s box office gross also might have benefited from some fans of the next film on this list.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left">2. <em>The Waterboy</em> – Walt Disney Co. ($161.4 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/the-waterboy-1024x576.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513529 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/the-waterboy-1024x576.jpg" alt="(Source Disney)" width="757" height="426" /></a> source: Disney[/caption]

Released in 1998, <em>The Waterboy </em>was a hugely lucrative hit for the studio and is one of Adam Sandler’s top-grossing films. The film tells the story of Bobby Boucher, a socially inept waterboy, who single handedly takes the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs to the Bourbon Bowl with the help of some pent up rage.

<em>The Waterboy</em> made $161 million domestically and $24 million on the foreign market for a total of $185 million. The film’s budget? Only $23 million. The film is also number one sports comedy of all time and had the following rankings for the year in 1998 — number five at the box office overall, third highest opening weekend, and second-highest grossing PG-13 film.

While <em>The Waterboy </em>had a pretty terrible reception with critics, it didn’t matter at a time when Sandler had considerable box office pull. Who doesn’t have at least five quotes from this movie always stocked up in the back of their head? Is the movie vapid? Yeah. But you can’t tell me you don’t leave it on when it comes on the television.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2 style="text-align: left">1. <em>The Blind Side</em> – Warner Bros. ($255.9 Million)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_513530" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2013/08/Blind-Side.jpg"><img class="wp-image-513530 fauuydsyglgmanxsmysf" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Blind-Side.jpg" alt="(Source Warner Bros)" width="757" height="504" /></a> Source: Warner Bros.[/caption]

The most recent film on this list is also the most lucrative — something which also brings up a discussion on inflation, but that’s another story. Released in 2009, <em>The Blind Side</em> stars Sandra Bullock, who later won Best Actress at the Oscars, and tells the true story of Michael Oher and his journey from an impoverished upbringing to his adoption by Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, and finally his journey towards the NFL.

With a domestic gross of $255 million, <em>The Blind Side </em>obliterates the competition — the film even managed to make $53 on the foreign market where most viewers probably don’t understand what football is. The kicker, though, is the budget for the film — $29 million. That means that the film made over ten times its budget. That there is a winner. Reviews for the film are generally positive, although some critics take issue with the film being overly sentimental. David <em>Fear of Time Out New York</em> also touches upon the bigger issue that many had with the film, <a href="http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-blind-side-2009">writing</a>, “It’s just blinkered middle-class pandering at its most shameless.”

But the overall views of the film are mostly positive. “Another uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama,” Joe Leydon of <em>Variety</em> <a href="http://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/the-blind-side-1200477424/">writes</a>. And Lou Lemenick of the <em>New York Post</em> <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/gridiron_maiden_zjVT2gPoN59dCthIt3SEGJ">writes</a>, “What makes <em>The Blind Side</em> a Thanksgiving treat is director Hancock’s subtle touch and admirable refusal to yield to sports movie clichés, something he did previously with <em>The Rookie</em> and <em>Remember the Titans</em>.”]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Rice has been out of the league for two seasons. Should he get another shot at playing in the NFL?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="article-body">
<p>[caption id="attachment_935551" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ray-Rice-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-935551" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ray-Rice-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ARLINGTON, TX - AUGUST 16:  Ray Rice #27 of the Baltimore Ravens sits on the bench against the Dallas Cowboys in the first half of their preseason game at AT&amp;T Stadium on August 16, 2014 in Arlington, Texas." width="757" height="530" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>It has been two complete seasons since former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has played in the NFL. Rice, <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-5-best-landing-spots-for-ray-rice.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">reinstated by the league in November of 2014</a>, has remained teamless since footage of him knocking his fiancee (now wife) out in a hotel elevator surfaced. Then, and now, the league&#8217;s involvement with the case marks a low point in its public relations history, and we have to wonder if Rice&#8217;s exile may be continued because he has become, for better or worse, the poster boy for domestic violence among athletes. Teams, fearing perhaps media attention as much as a player on the wrong side of his career, have been reluctant to sign him.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">&#8220;I&#8217;m still hopeful. It&#8217;s never over until it&#8217;s over," Rice told ESPNU&#8217;s Quint Kessenich at the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, where Rice is serving this week as a coach, </span><a style="line-height: 1.5" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york-jets/post/_/id/58093/jets-have-no-interest-in-ray-rice-but-theyve-talked-about-him" target="_blank">according to ESPN.com</a><span style="line-height: 1.5">. &#8220;I&#8217;m not ready to give it up. My second chance might have taken a little longer than I expected. I still know I have a lot of game left. I&#8217;m not worried about that part of it."</span></p>
<p>It has been over a year since Rice appealed his indefinite ban by the league, but you don&#8217;t have to be formally blacklisted in order to be persona non grata around the gridiron. NFL teams are notorious for wanting to avoid scrutiny of any kind, and baggage is viewed as an unwanted distraction that wouldn&#8217;t be welcomed by any franchise (ethics don&#8217;t play into this nearly as much as scrutiny &#8212; just ask Greg Hardy), but should teams move on from that train of thought and give the veteran running back a shot rekindling his professional career?</p>
</div>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_935554" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-935554" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ray-Rice-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="BALTIMORE, MD - AUGUST 07:  Running back  Ray Rice #27 of the Baltimore Ravens warms up before the start of an NFL pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers at M&amp;T Bank Stadium on August 7, 2014 in Baltimore, Maryland." width="757" height="504" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer with a simple response for several reasons. Rice is still technically in the prime of his career and could potentially offer a lot to an NFL team, but this determination comes down to whether a team believes that his playing ability outweighs what will come with it off the field. <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york-jets/post/_/id/58093/jets-have-no-interest-in-ray-rice-but-theyve-talked-about-him" target="_blank">The New York Jets have reportedly discussed the possibly of signing Rice</a>, for one, and while there&#8217;s little evidence that he&#8217;ll join that particular squad, the fact that an NFL team has discussed it internally does shine a little light at the end of the tunnel for the three-time Pro Bowler, even if he may have to wait a bit longer for teams to come around more to the idea. What Rice did was abhorrent, awful, and beyond the pale &#8212; what it is not, sadly, is unique.</p>
<p>In fact, the NFL has given many players second chances. Consider Michael Vick, who has played seven seasons in the league following a suspension for a widely-publicized role in a dog fighting ring, or Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, who missed almost the entire 2014 season for allegations regarding child abuse. He ran for a league-high 1,485 yards in 2015.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not in the business of absolving any of these men for what they have done. Instead, we&#8217;re suggesting that Rice&#8217;s status as a league pariah may have more to do with the visibility of his actions (and, potentially, the cynicism behind a front office unwilling to trust a nearly-30 quarterback) than any moral standard. Take, for instance, Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall, who had two domestic violence charges and a DUI prior to 2009 &#8212; who, it must be noted, has remained out of trouble with the law since and has become a vocal advocate for people suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD), which he was diagnosed with in 2011.</p>
<p>Is it that unrealistic to imagine Ray Rice in a similar role? Yes, what he did was inexcusable, and the league rightfully has zero tolerance for that sort of behavior, but if the NFL has given other players with similar scenarios a chance to redeem and remodel themselves, is Rice only being left out because of the footage?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In a 2015 season that was marred by injury and struggles to adjust a new offense, could the Seahawks trade the Pro Bowl tight end? If so here are 3 spots.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_868005" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-868005" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jimmy-Graham_Otto-Greule-Jr._Getty-Images_.jpg" alt="Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images[/caption]

You could call it a difficult first season with Seattle Seahawks for Pro Bowl tight end Jimmy Graham, but that might be too light. To some degree, his struggles were expected, as the adjustment to Seattle’s run-first philosophy after spending the first five years of his career as one of the primary options in the pass-heavy offense with the New Orleans Saints, a stint that saw him developing into one of the premier receiving tight ends in the league and posting four consecutive campaigns with at least 85 catches and 850 receiving yards, setting records for most receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns for a tight end in Saints history in the process.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Graham, obviously, had hoped this production would translate over to a big role in the Seahawks’ offense, but he </span>failed to surpass 60 receiving yards in five out of his first six games. For one week, it looked like things had turned around when the Hawks played the Carolina Panthers — Graham finished with season highs in receiving yards (140) and catches (eight) — but after that he only recorded two touchdowns for the entire 2015 season, including zero in the last eight games. Another attempt at turning the corner, against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 12, came to complete halt after he suffered a season-ending knee injury late in the game.

In his absence, the Seahawks made a late-season surge to the playoffs, ironically behind their passing game led Russell Wilson and Doug Baldwin. While this shift toward a more balanced offense could create a better situation for Graham to excel, Seattle could just as easily consider cutting ties with him in the offseason clearing $9 million in salary cap space or look into trading the talented tight end where there will certainly be a long line of suitors lining up to acquire his services.

Although general manager John Schneider has <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/seattle-seahawks/post/_/id/17830/will-jimmy-graham-be-back-with-the-seahawks">recently stated</a> that there’s no thought within the organization about parting ways with Graham, there’s always remains the possibility of that changing if the right deal were to come along. If so, here are three potential landing spots for Graham in the offseason.<!--nextpage-->
<h2><span style="line-height: 1.5;">1. New York Jets</span></h2>
[caption id="attachment_885845" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-885845" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/New-York-Jets-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Alex Goodlett/Getty Images" width="757" height="563" /> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

First thing’s first — heading into this offseason the Jets will have several things on their agenda to address: their quarterback scenario, with Ryan Fitzpatrick set to become an unrestricted free agent following his magical first season with the team — and they will also have to look into re-signing a few of their other prominent free agents such as defensive lineman Muhammad Wilkerson, who is coming off a career-high 12.0 sacks, and running back Chris Ivory, who led the AFC with 1,070 rushing yards.

This may be tough going for the team, expected to have just over $12 million in salary cap space, but provided all this has been sorted through, the Jets could look to make a much-needed upgrade on the offensive side of the ball at tight end (last season Jeff Cumberland and Kellen Davis combined for just eight catches for 95 receiving yards, not exactly what you want from that position). Graham would be a significant upgrade at the position and give the team another legitimate red-zone threat alongside their dynamic wide receiver duo of Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker.

Yes, the offense may become a bit more crowded with three established receiving options, but this is a welcome problem to have for a team that ranked 13th in the league in passing and 11th in scoring with 24.2 points per game last season. There’s no doubt Graham would immediately help make them one of the most potent passing attacks in the NFL. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Atlanta Falcons</h2>
[caption id="attachment_820809" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-820809 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Atlanta-Falcons_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevin C. Cox/Getty ImagesQuarterback Matt Ryan leads the Atlanta Falcons during a game at the Georgia Dome in 2014." width="757" height="540" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The Atlanta Falcons have been trying to fill the tight end role ever since the departure of future Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez two seasons ago. Mostly, it’s been a disaster. Jacob Tamme was a serviceable option in his first season with the team in 2015 by hauling in 59 catches for 657 receiving yards, but he isn’t anywhere near the caliber of player that Graham (or Gonzalez) is. Devonta Freeman may have put together an impressive rookie campaign and brought some much-needed balance to the offense, but it didn’t overshadow the team’s need for another receiving threat beyond Julio Jones.

The fact of the matter is that the Falcons have a passing game led mainly dependent on one legitimate receiver — Roddy White demonstrated last season that he’s no longer the same explosive player he was a few seasons ago that his role in the offense decrease significantly posting his fewest catches (43) and receiving yards (506) since his second season in the league. Leonard Hankerson saw his season cut short due to persistent hamstring problems, suffice it to say the Falcons may have placed in the top 10 in passing in the league, but their offense often times became stagnant this past, season ranking 21st with just 21.2 points per game.

The addition of Graham would give Atlanta a huge boost in the red zone something they desperately need after finishing the 2015 season 18th in the league converting just 54% percent of their trips. His presence would also give Matt Ryan another viable receiving option to depend on aside from Jones in crunch time. Altogether, there’s a pressing need in the passing game and Graham could be the ideal solution for the Falcons.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_856109" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-856109 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Aaron-Rodgers-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Christian Petersen/ Getty Images[/caption]

It was clearer than ever before in the 2015 season that the Green Bay Packers have <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-how-green-bay-can-fix-its-receiving-problems.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">an urgent need to add a legitimate receiving threat in the passing game</a>. With Jordy Nelson out for the entire season, the Packers remaining receivers struggled to pick up the slack in the passing attack. It was hoped that Randall Cobb could be the No.1 receiving option, but he struggled for much of the season with that responsibility recording 40 or fewer receiving yards in 10 games.

Veteran wideout James Jones had a strong start in his return to the team, but disappeared during stretches of the season as he dealt with nagging injuries. Second-year receiver Davante Adams struggled with the increased role hauling in just 53.2% of his targets while dropping six balls, which was 12th worst in the league. The Packers had also lost rookie wideout Ty Montgomery in Week 6 due to season-ending ankle surgery. This all equated to unproven players in Jeff Janis and Jared Abbrederis having to take on large roles in the offense.

That said, Aaron Rodgers was able to put together a strong season despite the instability in the receiving core with 3,821 passing yards along with 31 touchdown passes to only eight interceptions while posting a 92.7 quarterback rating. Richard Rodgers did provide some reliability at tight end with a career-best season with 58 catches, 510 receiving yards, and eight touchdowns. However, Graham would immediately step in as the top threat in the passing game that easing the pressure on the rest of the team’s receivers to play in more comfortable roles. All in all, it could be the move that propels them into Super Bowl contention next season and beyond.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728432 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Antonio-Brown-Wesley-Hitt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]

When it comes to the history of the NFL, we can safely say that the days of three yards and a cloud of dust are long gone. In recent years the ‘West Coast,’ five-wide, and no-huddle offenses have emerged as standard fare, rather than fourth quarter gimmicks. And offensive innovators like Mike Martz and Andy Reid can be credited with turning conventional football wisdom upon its head, and actually using the pass to set up the run. From the top, the League office has constantly tinkered with the rulebook in an apparent attempt to boost scoring. In today’s game, harsh penalties and fines protect quarterbacks and wide receivers from being mauled behind the line of scrimmage and across the middle.

The result has been an explosion of offense, as evidenced by recent record-setting campaigns from the likes of Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and Ben Roethlisberger, through the air. Each of the best wide receivers in the game today has developed real chemistry with his respective quarterback, after emerging as a go-to player who can consistently get open and move the chains. As playmakers, today’s elite wide receivers can score from anywhere out on the field and break games wide open. Here are the five best playing in the game right now.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Julio Jones</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-728446 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Julio-Jones-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="592" /> Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

As a physical specimen, Julio Jones stands 6’4 and weighs in at 220 pounds, while also being clocked at a blistering 4.39 / 40 time. At these specifications, Jones is simply too physical to be covered by diminutive cornerbacks, and too fast for linebackers and safeties to match up against. To deal with Jones, opposing defensive coordinators often signal in cover-two packages, where a corner works against Jones at the line of scrimmage, with safety help over the top. Jones’ mere presence on the field has opened up space for the likes of Matt Ryan, Tony Gonzalez, Roddy White, Michael Turner, and even Steven Jackson, in Atlanta.

In the passing game, Jones is notable for using his body to shield defenders at the line of scrimmage and make easy catches on quick slants. From there, Jones can also work the route tree for a slant-and-go, to beat an overanxious cornerback deep to the back of the end zone. In all, Julio Jones has snagged 246 receptions for 3,717 yards and 24 touchdowns<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoneJu02.htm" target="_blank"> through his first four seasons in the NFL</a>. For this  season, Jones has already caught 22 passes for 276 yards in his first two games.

<h2>4. Demaryius Thomas</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-728465 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Demaryius-Thomas-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="499" /> Jared Wickerham/Getty Images[/caption]

Of the elite receivers, it has been Demaryius Thomas who has benefitted most from the recent rule changes and favoritism toward the passing game. In 2012, Peyton Manning, then 36, signed on in Denver, as the “win now” replacement for Tim Tebow. The rule changes have helped Manning stay upright, while also allowing his coaches to install complex timing routes into the scheme. For 2013, Manning torched defenses for a record 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns passing. That year, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2013.htm" target="_blank">the Denver Broncos put up 606 points</a>, solidifying their position as the most prolific offense of all-time.

After the Manning signing, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2013.htm" target="_blank">Thomas’ numbers immediately spiked</a> from 32 catches for 551 yards and 4 touchdowns, to 94 catches for 1,434 yards and 10 touchdowns, between 2011 and 2012. For Manning, Thomas has emerged as somewhat of a utility man, who can beat deep coverage, run precise crossing routes across the middle, and also serve as a quick outlet on wide receiver screen passes. Going forward, Demaryius Thomas can further solidify his status as an elite receiver if he is able to help Peyton Manning ride off into the sunset with another Super Bowl trophy for the mantle piece.

<h2>3. Antonio Brown</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-728489" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Antonio-Brown-Andy-Lyons-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" />

Antonio Brown has emerged as the best possession receiver in the game through little more than sheer hard work. As a sixth-round pick in 2010 out of Central Michigan, Brown apparently lacked the pedigree of an elite wide receiver. Brown stands 5’10, weighs in at 180, and runs a somewhat pedestrian 4.5/40. In any event, Brown has emerged as a match-up nightmare at the professional level due to his quickness, precise route running, and willingness to work the middle. In his sophomore season, Brown broke out for 69 catches and 1,108 yards as a slot receiver. In 2013, he hauled in 110 catches, for 1,499 yards, and 8 touchdowns.  Last year, Brown has taken his game to the next level and actually <a href="http://pfref.com/tiny/QDITf" target="_blank">lead the league in both receptions (129) and yards (1698).
</a>

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowAn04.htm" target="_blank">The numbers</a> prove that Antonio Brown has a knack for staying open and is the perfect safety valve for Ben Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh. After the catch, the tenacious Brown often shifts gears and even lowers the boom on unsuspecting defensive backs to rack up extra yards. Certainly, Brown’s time back in the special teams return game has helped him to build upon his elusiveness in space.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Dez Bryant</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-728517 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dez-Bryant-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="580" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

The physically imposing Dez Bryant immediately proved himself worthy of wearing the #88 jersey, after being drafted to Dallas as the 24th overall pick out of Oklahoma State in 2010. For his part, Jerry Jones made good upon missing out upon Randy Moss, who was another freak athlete at wide receiver that slid too low on draft day. In Dallas, the Jekyll and Hyde comparisons between Dez Bryant and Michael Irvin may be all but inevitable.

On the field, Bryant has been held in high regard for his tireless work ethic, willingness to battle in the trenches, and unadulterated love for the game of football. As a wide out, Dez Bryant can often be seen challenging opposing DBs to mano a mano duels in space, running over linebackers, or even throwing blocks at the edge of the line of scrimmage. Off the field, however, Bryant’s reputation has been somewhat marred by cutaways of shouting matches with teammates, unpaid retail bills, and<a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/11/13/latest-report-on-dez-bryant-off-field-issues-could-be-much-ado-about-nothing/" target="_blank"> frequent run-ins with law enforcement officials</a>, unwittingly playing up to the diva caricature often lobbed at wide receiver.

Of course, Bryant is currently out for the foreseeable future after a Week 1 injury, but his talent remains undeniable.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Calvin Johnson</h2>
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-728535" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Calvin-Johnson-Jared-Wickerham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jared Wickerham/Getty Images" width="757" height="549" />

By the age of 29, Calvin Johnson, or Megatron, has already been compared to the likes of both Randy Moss and Jerry Rice in regards to the title of “greatest wide receiver of all-time”. At 6-foot-5, Johnson is often compared to Moss in that he has mastered the art of the jump ball, for both corner fade patterns and deep bombs. In terms of humility, Calvin Johnson is often likened to Jerry Rice. In 2008, Johnson was the lone spark on a historically awful Detroit Lions team that went 0-16. As a second year receiver, Megatron actually caught 78 passes for 1,331 yards, and 12 touchdowns, while going winless. Over the years, Johnson has refined his game as a route runner and blocker who never shies away from mixing things up in the middle of the field.

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnCa00.htm" target="_blank">In 2012</a>, Calvin Johnson put it all together, to rack up 122 catches for 1,964 yards, and 5 touchdowns. Statistically, Johnson’s 2012 season was one of the greatest individual efforts of all time, regardless of position. For the sake of comparison, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiceJe00.htm" target="_blank">Jerry Rice caught 122 balls for 1,848 yards and 15 touchdowns, in 1995</a>.

Going forward, Megatron’s placement among the all-time greats will remain largely contingent upon his own longevity and ability to stay healthy. Most impressively, he’s averaging 16.1 yards per catch, as a playmaker through his nine NFL seasons. In all, Calvin Johnson has racked up 655 catches for 10,527 yards and 75 touchdowns, with many more circus catches and highlight reel gallops into the end zone to come.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_931380" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roger-Goodell-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931380" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roger-Goodell-Jonathan-Daniel-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Roger Goodell announces the pick at the 2015 NFL Draft" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For some, this past weekend&#8217;s divisional round of the 2016 <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> playoffs was about as entertaining as they could&#8217;ve hoped for. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for everyone. As great as it feels when your favorite team makes the postseason, it hurts just as much when they get eliminated. And unlike the regular season, there is no &#8220;next week." A loss signifies the end of the road; the all-too-painful reminder that this year is &#8220;not your year." Of course, it also forces you to focus on the next crucial stage of the NFL process: <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000551301/article/2016-nfl-draft-order-and-needs-for-every-team" target="_blank">the draft</a>.</p>
<p>While the conclusion of each round of the playoffs brings us one step closer to the season&#8217;s champion lifting the Lombardi Trophy, it also brings us one step closer toward having a fully fleshed out draft order. And since we&#8217;re all about trying to project where the nation&#8217;s top prospects are going to end up when they get drafted, this is just another helpful piece of the puzzle. Therefore, with the latest set of playoff games behind us, here&#8217;s a look at our post-divisional round NFL Mock Draft 2016.</p>

<h2>1. Tennessee Titans: Laremy Tunsil, OT, Ole Miss</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_931387" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Laremy-Tunsil-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931387" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Laremy-Tunsil-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Laremy Tunsil #78 of the Mississippi Rebels celebrate his touchdown with teammates" width="757" height="544" /></a> Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Tennessee Titans could go a few different directions with their No. 1 overall pick. However, after watching Marcus Mariota prove he has the goods to be a legitimate franchise quarterback, we feel the Titans need to do everything they can to make sure he&#8217;s protected, which includes shoring up their offensive line and selecting Ole Miss tackle Laremy Tunsil.</p>
<p>At 6-foot-5, 305 pounds, the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/laremy-tunsil-1.html" target="_blank">junior standout</a> is big, strong, and &#8212; <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2016/insider/story/_/id/14385480/joey-bosa-top-robert-nkemdiche-drops-mel-kiper-2016-big-board-nfl-draft" target="_blank">per draft expert Mel Kiper&#8217;s evaluation</a> up to this point (subscription required) &#8212; the top pass-blocker in the draft. We reserve the right to change our opinion on this one. However, for now, Tunsil sits at the top of our board.</p>

<h2>2. Cleveland Browns: Jared Goff, QB, Cal</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_931398" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jared-Goff-hearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931398" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jared-Goff-hearon-W.-Henderson-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jared Goff looks to throw against ASU" width="757" height="511" /></a> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>By recently hiring Hue Jackson to be the team&#8217;s next head coach, the Cleveland Browns took a step in the right direction; one that should help folks <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-is-it-time-to-take-the-cleveland-browns-seriously.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">take them seriously</a>. If the Browns wish to keep the momentum going, they&#8217;d be wise to use the second overall pick to select Cal quarterback Jared Goff. When discussing the upcoming draft, the Browns new coach had the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000624126/article/hue-jackson-browns-need-to-go-get-qb-with-no-2-pick-in-draft" target="_blank">following to say</a>: &#8220;If there is a QB at No. 2 that is a best fit for our team, we need to go get him. It&#8217;s my opinion we need a QB."</p>
<p>The 6-f00t-4, 215-pound junior is definitely the most <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/2061053/jared-goff" target="_blank">pro-ready</a> in the class. He can make all the throws, is an accurate passer &#8212; <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/jared-goff-1.html" target="_blank">64.5% completion percentage</a> this season &#8212; and isn&#8217;t afraid to stand in the pocket and take a hit. Goff needs to add weight to his thin frame, and it would serve him well to spend his rookie year as a backup. Regardless, he has the necessary tools to be a top-notch NFL starter. Stay smart, Cleveland. Johnny Manziel should &#8212; and will &#8212; be out. Goff should be in.</p>

<h2>3. San Diego Chargers: Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_931405" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joey-Bosa-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931405" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joey-Bosa-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Defensive lineman Joey Bosa #97 of the Ohio State Buckeyes walks off the field after being ejected" width="757" height="505" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>If Ohio State defensive end Joey Bosa is still on the board at No. 3 (and that&#8217;s a big &#8220;if"), the San Diego Chargers shouldn&#8217;t hesitate. They should pounce. Immediately. There&#8217;s a reason Bosa is No. 1 on <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/draft2016/insider/story/_/id/14385480/joey-bosa-top-robert-nkemdiche-drops-mel-kiper-2016-big-board-nfl-draft" target="_blank">Mel Kiper&#8217;s Big Board</a> (subscription required). He&#8217;s just that good. Coming in at 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/joey-bosa-1.html" target="_blank">two-time consensus All-American</a> is powerful, versatile, and practically impossible to block one-one-one. Bosa is a dominant pass rusher and an undeniable game changer. This is one the Chargers shouldn&#8217;t even have to think about.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Dallas Cowboys: Jalen Ramsey, S/CB, Florida State</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_931408" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jalen-Ramsey-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931408" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jalen-Ramsey-Scott-Cunningham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jalen Ramsey gets set to play" width="757" height="547" /></a> Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys are another team that could go in multiple directions with this pick. However, if you factor in the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/32for32x160114/biggest-2016-draft-needs-every-nfl-team" target="_blank">club&#8217;s biggest needs</a>, Jerry Jones should probably look to upgrade the secondary. And in doing so, would be wise to take Florida State&#8217;s Jalen Ramsey. Ramsey is an absolute freak of an athlete. He is a multipurpose DB who can play either cornerback or safety. He&#8217;s instinctive, he&#8217;s rangy, and, at <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/jalen-ramsey-1.html" target="_blank">6-foot-1, 202 pounds</a>, he has the size to lay on the hurt. Ramsey would get the Cowboys faithful doing the Tomahawk Chop in no time.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>5. Jacksonville Jaguars: DeForest Buckner, DE, Oregon</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_931411" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DeForest-Buckner-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-931411" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DeForest-Buckner-Doug-Pensinger-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Defensive lineman DeForest Buckner #44 of the Oregon Ducks battle against the Colorado Buffaloes line at Folsom Field" width="757" height="505" /></a> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>In 2015, the Jacksonville Jaguars were <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/jax/2015.htm" target="_blank">last in the league in points allowed</a> (448 points; 28.0/g) and 29th in passing yards (4,291). When you think about these figures, it makes sense why the team&#8217;s biggest need revolves around <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/page/32for32x160114/biggest-2016-draft-needs-every-nfl-team" target="_blank">getting a pass rusher</a>. With that in mind, it seems like a no-brainer for the Jags to take Oregon defensive end DeForest Buckner.</p>
<p>Buckner is a 6-foot-7, 300-pound monster. In 2015, he had 83 total tackles, 17 tackles for loss, and 10.5 sacks on his way to being named the <a href="http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&amp;ATCLID=210550290" target="_blank">Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year</a>. With a crazy motor that goes on for days, we feel it would be only a matter of time before Buckner becomes a fan favorite down in Jacksonville.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a look at 5 teams facing serious salary cap issues heading into the 2016 NFL season.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_810132" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Super-Bowl-XLIX_1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-810132 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Super-Bowl-XLIX_1.jpg" alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

Parity is a huge part of what makes the NFL the most popular professional sports league in the United States, and that parity was largely made possible by the NFL’s implementation of a hard salary cap in 1994. Unlike other professional sports leagues, where willing teams are allowed to pay a luxury tax for having a total payroll that exceeds their salary cap, NFL teams are subject to fines, a loss of draft picks, and voided contracts for violating their league’s salary cap rules. This is why many teams are forced to constantly restructure contracts, make trades, or outright release some of their best players just to get right by the salary cap. On top of that, the NFL’s free agency period simply wouldn’t be the same if there weren’t a hard salary cap in place.

When it comes to circumventing the NFL salary cap, there is only so much a team can do. As it stands, all 32 teams around the league are in good standing with the league’s 2015 salary cap of $143,280,000 — which is not uncommon for this time of year. Projecting forward to the 2016 league year is a completely different story. While the cap is looking to increase in 2016, there are some teams who won’t be able to avoid facing serious cap conundrums following the 2015 season.

After crunching the 2016 salary cap numbers for all 32 NFL teams, we found that there are five teams in particular that are facing serious cap problems for the 2016 season. The front offices for all five teams will have their work cut out for them in trying to solve their financial issues, but the good news is they have a couple months left to do so. Without further ado, here is a look at five teams that are facing serious salary cap issues in 2016.

<em>* The 2016 NFL salary cap will likely be slightly higher than the 2015 cap of $143,280,000</em>

<h2>1.  Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_810140" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Miami-Dolphins.jpg"><img class="wp-image-810140 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Miami-Dolphins.jpg" alt="Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images" width="757" height="420" /></a> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Contracts:</span>  $160,324,653</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dead Money:</span>  $2,800,000</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total 2016 Salary Cap Figure:</span>  $163,124,653</li>
</ul>
The Dolphins are currently projected to be nearly $20 million over the salary cap in 2016. The league will almost surely raise the cap next year, but even that won’t be enough to relieve the Dolphins of their salary cap issues. To make matters worse, Miami still has to come up with the money to give defensive end Olivier Vernon a contract extension. The most likely candidate for a contract restructure is defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who is scheduled to have a cap hit of $28.6 million in 2016. After re-working Suh’s deal, the next most likely options for Miami would be to cut ties with defensive end Dion Jordan and restructure the contracts of cornerback Brent Grimes and punter Brandon Fields.

<h2>2.  Buffalo Bills</h2>
[caption id="attachment_807558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rex-Ryan.jpg"><img class="wp-image-807558 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rex-Ryan.jpg" alt="Brett Carlsen/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Contracts:</span>  $145,979,708</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dead Money:</span>  $0</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total 2016 Salary Cap Figure:</span>  $145,979,708</li>
</ul>
The Bills have one of the <a title="NFL: 5 Most Talented Rosters Heading Into the 2015 Season" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/5-most-talented-rosters-in-the-nfl-heading-into-the-2015-season.html/?tpl=op" target="_blank">most talented rosters in the NFL</a>. It’s true, and it should come as no surprise that Buffalo will be up against the salary cap in 2016. They will have very little money to work with next offseason without restructuring several contracts. With a scheduled salary cap hit of $19.9 million, defensive end Mario Williams is the most likely candidate for a restructured contract, followed by cornerback Stephon Gilmore and tight end Charles Clay.

<h2>3. Pitsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_557769" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-557769" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pittsburgh-Steelers_Justin-K.-Aller_Getty-Images-640x446.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="528" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Contracts:</span>  <span class="message_content">$142,062,271</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dead Money:</span>  <span class="message_content">  $508,845</span></li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total 2016 Salary Cap Figure:</span>  <span class="message_content"> $142,571,116</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="message_content">The Steelers are currently right up against the current salary cap limit of $143,280,000, and knowing that All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown will be seeking a new contract this offseason has to be somewhat worrisome for General Manager Kevin Colbert. In addition to Brown, the Steelers will need to start thinking about how they are going to find the cap space to sign running back Le’Veon Bell to an extension. </span>

<span class="message_content">One thing we know for sure is that the cap space likely won’t be coming from another restructured contract for quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Steelers have traditionally been one of the better teams in the league at managing their salary cap, but this may be their toughest test yet. </span>

<h2>4.  New Orleans Saints</h2>
[caption id="attachment_810142" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-Orleans-Saints.jpg"><img class="wp-image-810142 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-Orleans-Saints.jpg" alt="Kevin C.

<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Contracts:</span>  $157,940,226</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dead Money:</span>  $0</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total 2016 Salary Cap Figure:</span>  $157,940,226</li>
</ul>
The Saints have a lot of financial work to do before the start of the 2016 season. Restructuring quarterback Drew Brees’ contract is a near certainty, and the team will also likely be forced to cut ties with several veteran players following the 2015 season. The top contract restructure candidates for New Orleans (other than Brees) include safety Jairus Byrd and offensive guard Jahri Evans.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5.  New York Jets</h2>
[caption id="attachment_810143" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-York-Jets.jpg"><img class="wp-image-810143 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/New-York-Jets.jpg" alt="Rob Carr/Getty Images" width="757" height="490" /></a> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Active Contracts:</span>  $152,909,924</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dead Money:</span>  $0</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Total 2016 Salary Cap Figure:</span>  $152,909,924</li>
</ul>
In a matter of one offseason, the Jets went from being in the top five of the league in available to cap space to the bottom five. The team added (among others) cornerbacks Darrelle Revis, Antonio Cromartie, and Buster Skrine as free agents, and traded for wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Their toughest decision will be what they choose to do with defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson. If they are serious about re-signing him, there is a good chance that the Jets’ front office will attempt to restructure the contracts of offensive tackle D’Brickashaw Ferguson, Marshall, Revis, and center Nick Mangold.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the NFL, one of the most important defensive positions is at cornerback. If a team possesses an elite player at that position, it could go a long way in helping shut down an opposing offense, with their best wide receiver likely taken out of the game plan. There is plenty of talent at this position, but these are the top five cornerbacks currently in the NFL.</p>
<h2>5. Marcus Peters</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_933357" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-933357" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Marcus-Peters.jpg" alt="Marcus Peters #22 of the Kansas City Chiefs posing in a football game" width="757" height="504" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs took a chance on the former Washington cornerback with the 18th overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and it has paid off in a tremendous way. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PeteMa00.htm" target="_blank">Marcus Peters</a> took the league by storm as a rookie, finishing tied for the league with eight interceptions while recording a league-best 26 pass deflections. This includes not allowing a single touchdown between Weeks 8 and 16.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The 23-year-old&#8217;s outstanding play helped him earn what will likely be the first of many Pro Bowl selections. He should be named Defensive Rookie of the Year, which would make him just the fifth cornerback in league history to win the award and just the third overall since the 1992 season. </span>Despite finishing just his first season in the league, Peters is a special talent who has quickly become one of the top cornerbacks in the league.</p>
<h2>4. Aqib Talib</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_933356" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-933356" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Aqib-Talib.jpg" alt="Aqib Talib #21 of the Denver Broncos in a NFL game" width="757" height="503" /> Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Whatever happened inside <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaliAq99.htm" target="_blank">Aquib Talib</a> when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers traded him to the New England Patriots in the 2012 season elevated his game, making him one of the elite cornerbacks in the league. Since then, he has claimed three consecutive Pro Bowl selections and a Second-Team All-Pro nod.</p>
<p>In his first two seasons with the Denver Broncos, Talib has been a game-changer for a defense that this year boosted the top overall defense in the league against both the pass and run. The 29-year-old has played a major part of that with four interceptions and 13 pass deflections. Like the players ahead of him on this list, his numbers may not be in the top of the league, but opposing teams do not throw in his direction often because of coverage ability in both zone and man-to-man.</p>
<p>His time with the Buccaneers is often overlooked, but through the first three seasons in the league, he had 15 interceptions. He also has eight career defensive touchdowns. Prior to 2015, Talib may not have been in this conversation, but his play in his eighth season puts him squarely among the top players at his position as a part of the league&#8217;s best defense.</p>
<h2>3. Patrick Peterson</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_802056" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-802056 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Patrick-Peterson.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="530" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Arizona Cardinals cornerback has developed a strong reputation for guarding the opposing team&#8217;s best receiving option &#8212; be it a wide receiver lined up on the outside or in the slot &#8212; and even covering tight ends at times. Since entering the league in 2011, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PetePa00.htm" target="_blank">Patrick Peterson</a>&#8216;s stellar play has been rewarded with five straight Pro Bowl selections to start his career, along with three First-Team All-Pro nods (2011, 2013, and 2015).</p>
<p>In many ways, Peterson is the definition of a complete cornerback due to his ability to play in multiple coverage schemes &#8212; but his bread and butter has been in man-coverage. This is where he&#8217;s gained the separation in the league as one of the best at his position. There is certainly a huge reason why Peterson is well respected across the league because of his play on the field.</p>
<p>An added element that the other players on the list don&#8217;t have is his factor in special teams thanks to his ability to be a major force as a punt returner. Peterson made the league well aware of that in his rookie campaign by setting NFL records with four punt-return touchdowns in a single season, four punts returns that were 80-plus yards and brought back for touchdowns, 699 rookie punt return yards in a single season, and a 99-yard game-winning punt return for a touchdown in overtime.</p>
<h2>2. Richard Sherman</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_836529" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-836529" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Richard-Sherman_Jonathan-Ferrey_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jonathan Ferrey/Getty ImagesCornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the Seattle Seahawks celebrates after he tips the ball leading to an intereption by outside linebacker Malcolm Smith #53 to clinch the victory for the Seahawks against the San Francisco 49ers during the 2014 NFC Championship at CenturyLink Field on January 19, 2014 in Seattle, Washington.  (Photo by Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images)" width="757" height="505" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Since entering the league as a fifth-round pick out of Stanford in the 2011 NFL Draft, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SherRi00.htm" target="_blank">Richard Sherman</a> has become one of the elite defenders at his position, earning three consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2013-2015), three First-Team All-Pro nods, and one Second-Team All-Pro Selection. He was also the league&#8217;s interceptions leader in the 2013 season.</p>
<p>Detractors will point out that Sherman only plays one side of the field and doesn&#8217;t pick up the man-to-man coverage on the opposing team&#8217;s best wide receiver every week. However, opposing quarterbacks don&#8217;t try to test Sherman on his side of the field with the low volume of throws against him each week. (Just ask Aaron Rodgers.)</p>
<p>Opposing teams have to game-plan against Sherman because he essentially blankets the left side of the field and has been a major reason for the Seattle Seahawks ranking at either No. 1 or 2 in the league in pass defense over the last three seasons. The 27-year-old is worth the four-year, $57.4 million contract extension that he signed back in May 2014 thanks to what he brings to the team both on and off the field. He&#8217;s just entering the prime of his career and should remain near the top of this list for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h2>1. Darrelle Revis</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_831376" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-831376 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Darrelle-Revis_Jim-McIsaac_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jim McIsaac/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Jim McIsaac/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>There is a reason that this New York Jets cornerback is paid top dollar; he&#8217;s the top talent at his position and has been over the last several years. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/ReviDa99.htm" target="_blank">Darrelle Revis</a>&#8216;s track record speaks for itself with seven Pro Bowl selections, four First-Team All-Pro nominations, and AFC Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. The 30-year-old has been the best man-to-man coverage cornerback in the league with his ability to make the opposing team&#8217;s top receiving option a non-factor.</p>
<p>Revis&#8217;s numbers may not be among the league leaders, but that&#8217;s because teams don&#8217;t throw in his direction as often because of what he does defensively on a weekly basis. With that said, Revis was tied for fifth in the league with five interceptions. Many believed that Revis fell off in his lone campaign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2013. However, he returned to elite form in 2014 with the New England Patriots, shutting down some of the league&#8217;s best wideouts on &#8220;Revis Island," which included Demaryius Thomas, A.J. Green, Calvin Johnson, Sammy Watkins, Keenan Allen, and Brandon Marshall.</p>
<p>Revis is the best, most fundamentally sound defensive back player in the league. He has a unique skill set that brings out the best of opposing receivers each week. Ultimately, he&#8217;s the top player at his position, and his ability to lock down any opposing receiver only boosts his case as the best in the game.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The defense is foaming at the mouth to make a play, shut down the opposition, and get the ball back for the offense. Here are the top ten NFL greats.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[NFL fans are familiar with raucous 12th man crowds and chants for defense. Scenario: Your team needs to put together a defensive stand to seal away a victory in the fourth quarter of a nip-and-tuck game. The passionate home crowd will be out for blood as the opponent sets up first and ten at its own 20. To all, the defense feeds off the home-cooked energy and is also foaming at the mouth to make a play, shut down the opposition, and get the ball back for the offense. The electricity is real as both teams break huddle and approach the line of scrimmage. Defense is beautiful. Here are 10 of the best defensive players the NFL has ever seen.

<h2><strong>10. Deion Sanders</strong></h2>
Deion Sanders was the greatest pure cover corner of all time. <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/fastest-40-yard-dash-times-in-nfl-history/">Once clocked at 4.18 – 40 speed</a>, it was impossible to outrun and even out-throw Prime Time. Before the exploits of Darrelle Revis, Deion was on his own coverage island, as he was always primed to duel and shut down the likes of Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin, and Andre Rison. In one-on-one coverage, Deion would dominate his entire half of the field, as opposing quarterbacks would simply refuse to challenge this man through the air. In terms of accolades, Deion parlayed his talents into one <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/award_apdpoy.htm">1994 AP Defensive Player of the Year</a> award alongside eight Pro Bowl appearances as a member of the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, and Dallas Cowboys.

<h2><strong>9. Rod Woodson</strong></h2>
A versatile performer, cornerback Rod Woodson could wreak havoc from all angles. For #26, a typical day at the office might include 7 tackles, 2 pass break ups, 1 interception, 1 sack, and 1 punt return touchdown. Despite his graceful style and position, Rod Woodson was never afraid to get down and dirty in blue collar Pittsburgh and Baltimore. In Pittsburgh, Woodson mastered the art of the slot blitz, where he would line up as a nickel back, before coming off the edge to take shots at the opposing quarterback behind the line of scrimmage. In Baltimore, Woodson slid over to safety, where he helped to quarterback one of the greatest defenses of all time to a <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-super-bowl/09000d5d80151cc9/Super-Bowl-Memories-Super-Bowl-XXXV">Super Bowl XXXV</a> 34-7 shellacking over the New York Giants.

<h2><strong>8. Bruce Smith</strong></h2>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU8gvF6WCIk">Bad things, man</a>. Bad things. Bruce Smith closed out his <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/sacks_career.htm">NFL career as the all time sack leader</a> with 200 career quarterback takedowns. Standing at 6-foot-4 and weighing in at 264 pounds of muscle, Bruce Smith was an unreal combination of speed and power for the Buffalo Bills. At right defensive end, Smith faced off against the most talented left tackles in the game and turned these mammoth men into mush with his up field rush. A master of the spin move, Bruce Smith would explode off the ball, feint to his right, and spin back to the inside before accelerating to pound the quarterback. When using the power technique, Bruce would simply pin his ears back, get low, and use leverage to strong arm some stiff offensive linemen into his own backfield.

No. 78, of course, was equally as dominant against the run game. With his speed, Bruce could track down the ball carrier on the weak side and make the tackle from behind. With his strength and discipline, Bruce Smith could also muck it up on the strong side point of attack, shed blockers, and make a stop.

<h2><strong>7. Deacon Jones</strong></h2>
Deacon Jones invented the meaning of the word of sack. Illegal today, Jones perfected his infamous head slap to dominate the line of scrimmage. To operate in space, The Deacon would smack an offensive lineman upside the head. With the lineman stunned, Jones was free to maneuver behind the line of scrimmage and incite mayhem. Due to the success of this move, historians have often argued that Jones would be far and away the leader in sack totals — if the statistic were to be officially recorded in his day.

Deacon Jones and fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen alongside Lamar Lundy and Rosey Grier joined forces as the Fearsome Foursome for the 1960s Rams. As part of this group, Deacon Jones appeared in seven out of his <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=108">eight total Pro Bowls</a> before being traded to the San Diego Chargers in 1972. The Deacon continued to dominate into the twilight of his career, before transitioning into today’s grandfatherly television persona.

<h2><strong>6. Ronnie Lott</strong></h2>
Ronnie Lott is the greatest NFL defensive back of all time as an All-Pro at both cornerback and safety. Ronnie Lott has gone down in NFL lore as a devastating hitter with no regard for his own body. Lott brought toughness to 1980s San Francisco 49ers teams more so identified with finesse and precise, West Coast passing. As a test of a man, Ronnie Lott actually agreed to have the tip of his pinky finger amputated — just to stay in the game.

Fundamentally sound, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LottRo00.htm">Ronnie Lott was a stat sheet stuffer</a> and perennial Pro Bowler during his 14-year career. In 1985, Lott alternated between free safety and corner, while going on to record 104 tackles, 6 interceptions, 2 sacks, and 2 fumble recoveries. Through sheer instinct, Ronnie Lott just happened to be at the right place at the right time.

<h2><strong>5. “Mean Joe” Greene</strong></h2>
At tackle, Mean Joe Greene anchored the ’70s Dynasty Pittsburgh Steel Curtain. Equally relentless against both the run and pass game, Greene utilized an angular technique to disrupt blocking assignments at the line of scrimmage. To do so, Greene would wedge his body between the center-guard A-Gap. At that snap of the football, Greene would either shoot the gap to make a play, or tie up two blockers so linebackers Jack Ham and Jack Lambert could run downhill and deliver their own form of punishment at the point of attack.

Mean Joe Greene’s tenacity and refuse-to-lose attitude translated into two AP Defensive Player of the Year awards, 10 Pro Bowls, four Lombardi Trophies, <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=80">one bronzed bust in Canton</a>, and one classic commercial. Here, kid. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8">Have a Coke and a smile</a>.

<h2><strong>4. Dick Butkus</strong></h2>
Dick Butkus brought the pain to the 1960s and 70s Black and Blue division. A true Monster of the Midway, Butkus opened up the door for the likes of Mike Singletary and Brian Urlacher at Bears’ middle linebacker. Due to his ability to diagnose plays, Dick Butkus always appeared one step faster than the competition and emerged as one of the most feared tacklers of all time. Butkus thrived upon contact and intimidation as he tossed aside blockers before sniffing out the football and laying the ball carrier out upon his back. Dick Butkus just wanted it more.

<h2><strong>3. Reggie White</strong></h2>
The late Reggie White was the most disruptive defensive lineman to ever throw on a pair of shoulder pads. In Philadelphia, the Minister of Defense teamed up with Clyde Simmons, Ron Pitts, and Jerome Brown to dominate the trenches in defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan’s madman scheme.

At left defensive end, White brutalized opponents with his famed hump move. The hump move begins with an explosive first step off the line of scrimmage. From there, White barreled into some right tackle sap, shrugged his shoulders, raised his right arm, and tossed aside a 300-pound lineman as if he were a rag doll. White then roamed the backfield scot-free to lay down the law and wood upon the opposing quarterback. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WhitRe00.htm">Between 1985 and 2000</a>, Reggie White’s hump move helped him to record 1048 tackles, 198 sacks, 13 trips to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl, and two NFL AP Defensive Player of the Year Awards.

Reggie White was also a pioneer of the mega-bucks free agency movement. In 1993, Reggie White took his talents to Green Bay and the Frozen Tundra — with much fanfare. The deal was one of the most successful in sports history, as White went on to rack up 68.5 sacks and claim one Super Bowl trophy for his new Wisconsin home.

<h2><strong>2. Ray Lewis</strong></h2>
Ray Lewis, who called himself God’s linebacker, was a natural born leader. A mic’d up Ray Lewis has been recorded barking at his teammates to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urryjd1hhns">give it all up, right here and right now</a>.” The Baltimore Ravens franchise, of course, fell right in line behind Lewis’s grit and passion. To all, opponents and fans respected Ray Lewis for his love of the game, sportsmanship, and desire to play his best football.

On the football field, Ray Lewis was a cerebral and physical specimen. Mentally, Lewis was a coach on the field, who would anticipate offensive play calls, audible defensive shifts, and arrive at the point of attack to make tackles time and time again. Physically, Ray Lewis was an imposing 6’1″, 250-pound man who loved to throw his weight around and knock people into the operating room and into next week. After putting multiple careers on ice, Ray Lewis would offer up his telephone number to players for brotherly support and counsel. Ray Lewis won two Super Bowls before retiring in 2012.

<h2><strong>1. Lawrence Taylor</strong></h2>
Lawrence Taylor was the greatest defensive weapon of all time. The leader of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wiQ18jDWqo">pack of crazed dogs</a>, L.T. remained in attack mode and out for blood. Lawrence Taylor, together with masterminds Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick, effectively changed the game for outside linebacker. In New York, No. 56 actually imposed his will on the offense, instead of reading and reacting to the action as had been the case with outside backers of years past. In response, Washington Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs and other NFC East division rivals were forced to install two-tight end sets, H-backs, motion, and jumbo offenses in an attempt to contain Taylor and his raw athleticism. Despite the creativity, nothing worked. Lawrence Taylor could not be stopped.

In 1986, <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=212">L.T. put everything together</a> and took home NFL MVP honors as a defender. That year, Lawrence Taylor rang up 20.5 sacks, made 105 tackles, broke up five passes, and forced two fumbles. After the 1986 regular season, Lawrence Taylor went on to win his first of two career Super Bowls. Lawrence Taylor was a force.

		<description><![CDATA[We take a look at which QBs have been able to thwart expectations and propel their teams to greatness. The number one spot is definitely not who you think.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_745557" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745557 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Joe-Montana-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

What is clutch? It’s a sports question as old as the duality of winners and losers, a status that exists outside of the more measurable box score tangibles like passing yards and interceptions. To <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/09/27/the-origins-of-justice-stewarts-i-know-it-when-i-see-it/" target="_blank">paraphrase Potter Stewart</a>, most people know clutch when they see it, even if they’re not equipped to properly define it in polite discourse (or in matters concerning the Supreme Court). This gets concerning pretty quickly, particularly when it comes to matters of ranking, the natural mode for most sports-inclined folks.

Luckily for us — and for anyone who’s interested in these sorts of things — the fine people over at <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a> have come up with a way to examine just how clutch a player can be in the playoffs, when the clutch is really present. How did they do it? Essentially, they took each of the nominal starters since the NFL really became the NFL in 1970, then measured the QB’s performance against a replacement level signal caller’s expected performance. "<span class="message_content">Replacement level," in this case, essentially meaning an average NFL quarterback for that particular season.</span> The results are a mixture of the expected and the totally befuddling, but we’ll get to that momentarily.
<h2>5. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745590 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="565" /> Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Boasting a lifetime playoff record of 14 wins to seven losses, Elway’s replacement level simulation would have graded out to roughly nine wins and 12 losses (the hard numbers are 8.9 wins and 12.1 losses, because that’s the nature of the evaluation). Furthermore, there’s roughly a 1% chance that the average quarterback would have replicated Elway’s feats. If a working definition of “clutch" is to describe players who do things that their lesser contemporaries can’t, this is looking like a pretty good system so far.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Joe Flacco</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745587" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745587 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Joe-Flacco-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="529" /> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]

Weirdly, Flacco places higher on this list than Tom Brady (who finished sixth), despite the fact that the Patriots dispatched the Ravens in the most recent postseason. How does this work? Prior to this postseason, Brady went 18 wins to 8 losses against the average of about 13 and 13 (hard numbers: 12.6 wins to 13.4 losses). Flacco’s 10 and five record is coming against an expectation of nearly the opposite — five wins and 10 losses. In other words, it’d be less likely for a faceless, anonymous quarterback to do what Flacco did than to do what Tom Brady did in the postseason (and here we remember Matt Cassell in 2008), so Flacco’s arguably more clutch, especially when you consider that the Pats were the favorites in most of their games, hurting Brady’s overall score. Make sense? Don't get deflated over it.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Kurt Warner</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745581" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745581 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kurt-Warner-Donald-Miralle-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="485" /> Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

A replacement level quarterback would have lead Kurt Warner’s playoff teams to a four win, nine loss record. That is exactly the opposite of what the real Kurt Warner did over the course of his NFL career, when he lead his teams to nine wins and four losses, something that, running these simulations over and over again, has a 0.3% chance of happening. Yes, that is three-tenths of one percent. Kurt Warner: Pretty clutch.

Again, these are the conventional wisdom guys — Kurt Warner and Joe Montana were clutch quarterbacks, the sun rises in the East, the planets rotate around the Sun, and so on. That doesn’t make them any less impressive. Montana went 16 wins against five losses during his playoff tenure: The average player would’ve gone 10-11.

<h2>1. Eli Manning</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745566" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-745566 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Eli-Manning-Alex-Goodlett-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /> Alex Goodlett/Getty Images[/caption]

This is not a typo. You might be thinking “Hey, where’s Peyton? What is this list?! It’s all bullshit!" Well, Peyton grades out at number 28 on the list (seriously, you can read it <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-clutch-postseason-quarterback-of-all-time-is-eli-manning/" target="_blank">here</a>). As for the reasoning behind it, we’ll leave this one to Nate Silver, who did the original research for FiveThirtyEight.

“[Manning’s] New York Giants have often been underdogs in the postseason and projected to a record of 4-7 or perhaps 5-6 in his 11 games. Instead, Eli Manning’s teams have gone 8-3." Silver continues to reevaluate in his article — because there’s no way Eli comes out on top again, right? — and, ultimately, the younger Manning still comes out on top.

		<description><![CDATA[It's offense versus defense in an AFC divisional-round matchup between Denver and Pittsburgh. Which team is more likely to move on to championship weekend?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_929215" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-929215" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Emmanuel-Sanders-Denver-Broncos-v-Pittsburgh-iLOG4g5Uwv0l.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The Denver Broncos and the Pittsburgh Steelers are two of the league’s most recognizable franchises, owning a total of eight combined Super Bowl victories and producing some of the NFL’s most iconic players. Having met seven times in the postseason (with Denver holding a 4-3 edge in those meetings), the two teams will face off once again in the divisional round of the playoffs this Sunday with a spot in the AFC Championship game on the line.

Earlier this season, Pittsburgh earned a key victory against the Broncos in Pittsburgh that helped the Steelers get into the AFC playoffs. This time, the game will take place in Denver, as the Broncos earned the top seed in the AFC with a 12-4 record that saw them secure the AFC West (the Steelers are the No. 6 seed in the AFC). Denver holds a great defense; Pittsburgh possesses a great offense when at full power (more on that later). The contradicting styles could produce the most exciting matchup of the entire divisional round. With that, let’s break down key matchups and X-factors to see which team has the edge in this contest.
<h2>Key matchups</h2>
[caption id="attachment_924269" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-924269" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Antonio-Brown-Justin-Aller-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt=" Justin Aller/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Justin Aller/Getty Images[/caption]

There are several key matchups here. None of them compare to Denver’s secondary against Pittsburgh’s passing attack. The Broncos possesses the top NFL defense, as they gave up the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/position/defense/seasontype/2" target="_blank">fewest yards per game</a> this season. Conversely, the Steelers own one of the best passing attacks in the league, putting up about <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/netPassingYardsPerGame/seasontype/2" target="_blank">288 yards per game</a> through the air in 2015.

When the Broncos’ strength met the Steelers’ strength back in Week 15, Pittsburgh exposed Denver’s secondary. Ben Roethlisberger threw for 380 yards and three touchdowns to lead the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/game?gameId=400791723" target="_blank">Steelers’ comeback victory</a> in the second half. The great Antonio Brown ran wild through the Broncos’ secondary, catching 16 passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns against one of the best corners in the league in Chris Harris Jr. It was easily the Denver defense’s worst performance of the entire season.

In Sunday’s game, it is imperative that the Broncos’ contain Roethlisberger and Brown — if they are on the field. Both players are dealing with injuries suffered in Pittsburgh’s victory over the Cincinnati Bengals last weekend. Roethlisberger has a shoulder injury, and his status is <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/01/14/roethlisberger-limited-antonio-brown-still-out/" target="_blank">still up in the air</a> at this point. Brown, on the other hand, is going through the concussion protocol and could miss the game. The Steelers’ can likely handle not having Brown in the game, but need their quarterback to play if they have any chance of beating the Broncos on the road.

<strong>[update: Brown has since been ruled out for this game]</strong>

Another key factor in this game will be the performance of Broncos QB Peyton Manning. He hasn’t started a game since mid-November due to an injury, although he did come off the bench to lead Denver to a victory in their regular season finale against the San Diego Chargers. Manning <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/interceptions/seasontype/2" target="_blank">led the league in interceptions</a> prior to his injury, so it is imperative that he takes care of the ball in this one. If he is anything close to his normal self, Denver should have an even greater chance to win this game behind that great defense.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>The X-factors</h2>
[caption id="attachment_919720" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-919720" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/C-J-Anderson-Cincinnati-Bengals-v-Denver-Broncos-wkjGvYRvJWPl.jpg" alt="Doug Pensinger/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

Each team has several players who are critical to their success. The key factors for the Broncos are running backs, C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman. Whenever Denver ran the ball well this season, they won (6-0 when either Anderson or Hillman went over 100 yards). Both players showed their abilities to break the game open with huge touchdown runs, and they will be vital to the Broncos’ offensive game plan against Pittsburgh, especially since it’s unknown how well Manning will play in his first full game back since his injury.

Outside of the health of their key players, the big X-factor in this game for the Steelers is receiver Martavis Bryant. Behind Brown, Bryant proved to be an explosive playmaker throughout the season for Pittsburgh, as he averaged over 15 yards per reception. In the team’s <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400820428" target="_blank">wild-card victory over the Bengals</a>, Bryant scored the Steelers’ lone touchdown and went off for a huge 44-yard run. His speed is matched by few players in the league and if Brown can’t play, he will be the go-to man for Roethlisberger (or whoever throws the ball for Pittsburgh).
<h2>Who wins?</h2>
[caption id="attachment_800185" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-800185 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Peyton-Manning.jpg" alt="Dustin Bradford/Getty ImagesDENVER, CO - DECEMBER 8: Quarterback Peyton Manning #18 of the Denver Broncos celebrates a 20 yard fourth quarter touchdown pass to Eric Decker #87 (not pictured) during a game against the Tennessee Titans at Sports Authority Field Field at Mile High on December 8, 2013 in Denver, Colorado.

The Steelers’ potential rash of injuries may take some of the juice out of this matchup. We don’t see how Pittsburgh has a chance to win if Roethlisberger can’t play, and considering how huge Brown was in the first meeting between these two teams, the lack of his presence could see their chances go out the window. While it’s likely that Roethlisberger will play, it just seems to be too much for the Steelers to overcome when they go up against a great Broncos defense. A healthy Manning, a strong running game, and game-changing plays by Von Miller, Aqib Talib, and Denver’s defense should see the top-seeded Broncos advance to host the AFC Championship game.

		<description><![CDATA[What does an all-time blowout look like? We take a glance back at some of the most lopsided results in the NFL's modern (Super Bowl) era.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_507417" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2015/01/Falcons-Bucks-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Image.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507417" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Falcons-Bucks-Mike-Ehrmann-Getty-Image.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

When the Atlanta Falcons took a 56-0 lead in the third quarter of their matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2014, it got us wondering two things. One: Is the Georgia Dome scoreboard equipped with a third digit in case the Falcons break the century mark? And, two: If things really got out of hand, where might Falcons-Bucs rank among the worst blowouts in NFL history? (So much for a league of parity, right?)

The Falcons avoided running up the score, coasting to a 56-14 win and keeping that  game off of this list. Here, for your perusal, are the top seven blowouts in modern professional football (since the first Super Bowl was played). For the purposes of this project, we looked for winning teams that scored at least 60 points in a lopsided victory (margin of 35 points or more). Games are listed in chronological order .
<h2>1. Giants 62, Eagles 10: November 26, 1972</h2>
The Eagles only won two games in the entire 1972 season, and their level of talent (or lack thereof) was painfully obvious in an embarrassing <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197211260nyg.htm" target="_blank">52-point loss</a> to the Giants at old Yankee Stadium. New York’s Norm Snead and Randy Johnson both threw multiple touchdown passes in the game, as the Giants rolled up more than 500 yards of total offense and scored the final 31 points of the afternoon.

<h2>2. Bengals 61, Oilers 17: December 17, 1972</h2>
In a game that was just 3-3 after the first quarter, Cincinnati exploded for a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197212170oti.htm" target="_blank">44-point win</a> in the Astrodome. The Bengals forced five Houston turnovers in the contest and got three fourth-quarter interception returns for touchdowns (two from Lemar Parrish), even though the outcome had long since decided.
<h2>3. Falcons 62, Saints 7: September 16, 1973</h2>
There were no points scored in this game until the second quarter…but once they started, they didn’t stop. The Saints were dominated at home, due in no small part to quarterback Archie Manning’s five interceptions. In all, New Orleans committed eight turnovers <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197309160nor.htm" target="_blank">in the game</a>. Atlanta finished with 32 first downs on the day, compared to just 11 for the home team.
<h2>4. Bears 61, Packers 7: December 7, 1980</h2>
Walter Payton rushed for 130 yards and three touchdowns as the 1980 Chicago Bears dominated NFC Central opponent Green Bay. The Bears outscored the visitors 33-0 after halftime and finished with 594 yards of offense, overcoming 10 penalties to <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198012070chi.htm" target="_blank">blow out the Packers</a> in a cakewalk even though Chicago would finish the season under .500.

<h2>5. Bengals 61, Oilers 7: December 17, 1989</h2>
Apparently, something about when Cincinnati and Houston got together just seemed to be a recipe for a blowout. Seventeen years to the day after the aforementioned 44-point Bengals win, the Oilers found themselves on the wrong end of a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198912170cin.htm" target="_blank">even more lopsided</a> loss to Cincinnati. Only one of these two teams entered the day with a winning record, and surprisingly, it was Houston (then 9-5 and ultimately bound for the postseason). The Bengals led 52-0 after three quarters, thanks to four Boomer Esiason touchdown passes.
<h2>6. Jaguars 62, Dolphins 7: January 15, 2000</h2>
Perhaps the worst blowout on this list came in the playoffs (!) <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200001150jax.htm" target="_blank">following the 1999 NFL season</a>. The last game of Dan Marino’s career was one to forget, as Miami fell behind 41-0 before getting on the scoreboard against its in-state foe. Jaguars backup quarterback Jay Fiedler threw two touchdowns in the second half, and would eventually succeed Marino as the Dolphins’ starting quarterback for the upcoming 2000 season. Seven Miami turnovers didn’t help the Dolphins’ cause at all in one of the worst postseason losses ever.
<h2>7. Saints 62, Colts 7: October 23, 2011</h2>
The Saints had Drew Brees. The Colts didn’t have Peyton Manning. That was pretty much the story of the final game on our list. Brees went 31-35 for five touchdowns in a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201110230nor.htm" target="_blank">62-7</a> romp over visiting Indianapolis during the fall of 2011. The Saints played a nearly perfect game, scoring at least 13 points in each quarter, only committing one penalty all night, and not turning the ball over.

		<description><![CDATA[According to Forbes, NFL's ten richest owners are worth a combined $61 billion. Here's a look at the 5 individuals who tower above the rest.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_855321" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Paul-Allen-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-855321 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Paul-Allen-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Paul Allen hoists the NFC Championship trophy" width="757" height="557" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

Would anything be more fun than owning an <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> franchise?

Think about it. The National Football League is one of the most exciting enterprises in all of sports. It’s popularity is out of control, its marketability is second to none, and it has a crazy reach with endless possibilities of growth potential. Considering the money the league generates on a regular basis, the financial rewards speaks for itself. Plus, it’d be pretty sweet to be able to lift the Lombardi Trophy at the end of the season.

Obviously, not everyone has the means to own an organization in the National Football League. You have to be rolling in some serious loot to be able to purchase one these bad boys. And by all accounts, today’s NFL owners are swimming in cash.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/09/14/the-nfls-richest-owners/" target="_blank">According to Forbes</a>, the 10 richest owners in the National Football League have a combined net worth of $61 billion. That is a lot of green right there. Of course, as it is with most things, there will always be those individuals who are able to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack. You’d be amazed at how much these special few are worth. With that in mind, here’s a look at the five richest owners in the National Football League: Try not to get too jealous.
<h2><!--nextpage-->5. Jerry Jones, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_792032" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jerry-Jones_Cowboys.jpg"><img class="wp-image-792032 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jerry-Jones_Cowboys.jpg" alt="Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones" width="757" height="505" /></a> Steve Dykes/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $5 billion</li>
</ul>
If you follow the NFL at all, then it’d be almost impossible not to know who <a href="http://www.dallascowboys.com/team/staff/roster/jerry-jones" target="_blank">Jerry Jones</a> is. He’s practically as famous as the team team he owns. While it’s not wrong to say that Jones has oftentimes made questionable decisions as the Dallas Cowboys general manager, the fact is, Big D is now worth $4 billion, making it the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-most-valuable-teams-in-2015.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">most valuable team in the entire league</a>. Clearly, this self-made billionaire has maximized the brand power of The Star.
<h2><!--nextpage-->4. Shahid Khan, Jacksonville Jaguars</h2>
[caption id="attachment_855326" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Shahid-Khan-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-855326 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Shahid-Khan-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images-Rob-Carr-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan" width="757" height="505" /></a> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $5.6 billion</li>
</ul>
If you ask us, Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan has far and away the best look out of anyone on this entire list. Seriously, how suave can a guy get? Of course, you can only make this list if you’re a wealthy owner. Considering he bought the Jags in 2012 for $770 million and now Forbes estimates the team to be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/09/14/the-nfls-richest-owners/" target="_blank">worth $1.78 billion</a>, and Khan’s “<a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/shahid-khan/" target="_blank">auto parts maker, Flex-N-Gate, grosses nearly $4.9 billion in sales</a>," we’d say he’s not just a business man, he’s a business, man! Yeah, that’s worth a <a href="http://genius.com/17918" target="_blank">Jay-Z</a> lyric.
<h2><!--nextpage-->3. Stephen Ross, Miami Dolphins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_704373" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Stephen-Ross-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-704373" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Stephen-Ross-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross" width="757" height="493" /></a> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Net worth</span>: $6.7 billion</li>
</ul>
Coming in at No. 3 on the wealthiest owners list is Miami Dolphins head honcho <a href="http://www.miamidolphins.com/team/staff/steven-ross/f0a28e3e-5ff7-409e-bc14-48c9b3f978bd" target="_blank">Stephen Ross</a>, who <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/emdm45elmmf/3-stephen-ross/" target="_blank">Forbes estimates is worth a cool $6.7 billion</a>. If you want to know how Ross acquired his wealth, we have two words for you: Real estate. He is the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/stephen-ross/" target="_blank">chairman of Related Companies</a>, one of the biggest real estate and property management firms in the country. For good measure, he is also the owner of Equinox Fitness. So if you’re one of those people who loves to get your sweat on in style, here’s the man you can thank for that.
<h2><!--nextpage-->2. Stan Kroenke, St. Louis Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_855338" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jeff-Fisher-and-Stan-Kroenke-Michael-Thomas-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-855338 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jeff-Fisher-and-Stan-Kroenke-Michael-Thomas-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher (L) speaks with team owner Stan Kroenke" width="757" height="504" /></a> Michael Thomas/Getty Images[/caption]

St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke is worth $7.6 billion, however, he didn’t just get there by owning an NFL franchise, he’s all about <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2015/09/14/the-nfls-richest-owners/" target="_blank">building a sports empire</a>. Kroenke owns the NBA’s Denver Nuggets, the NHL’s Colorado Avalanche, the MLS’ Colorado Rapids, and a majority of the English Premier League club, Arsenal. Per Forbes, the value of those five organizations combine to be worth $4.1 billion. Of course, if you’re really interested in learning what Kroenke is all about, check out his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/your-cheat-sheet-to-the-proposed-nfl-stadium-in-los-angeles.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">plan to bring the Rams back to Los Angeles</a>.

<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks" target="_blank">Seattle Seahawks</a> owner <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-allen/" target="_blank">Paul Allen</a> isn’t just the richest owner in the NFL, he’s also one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. That’s what happens when you’re a cofounder of Microsoft. What’s more fun than being an owner of a professional sports franchise? Owning multiple franchises, obviously. Not only does Allen own the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA, but he also has a piece of the Seattle Sounders of Major League Soccer.

Not bad. Not bad at all.

		<description><![CDATA[These are four teams we believe may break their fans' hearts during the NFL Playoffs.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between 2008 and 2013, the New York Giants, Green Bay Packers, and Baltimore Ravens each muddled through relatively up-and-down regular seasons, before sneaking into the playoffs with a wild-card berth and somehow peaking at just the right time en route to an improbable Super Bowl run. Alternatively, the Indianapolis Colts, Cincinnati Bengals, and Denver Broncos are all franchises that must ultimately win the Big One in order to shake the “choker” label; they&#8217;ve ripped through successive regular seasons, only to self-destruct in the playoffs.</p>
<p>This offseason will likely further expose the inherent flaws in today’s playoff format, with division winners automatically hosting first-round home games, irrespective of records. As such, the hottest teams in the league &#8212; Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Seattle &#8212; will each open the playoffs on the road, with Vegas lines all <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/nfl-playoff-betting-lines-2016-updated-point-spreads-overunders-wild-card-weekend-2255441" target="_blank">betting on the wild-card road teams</a> as the clear favorites. Going forward, it may not be a question of if the following four teams will choke, but how exactly they will fall apart in the playoffs and break the hearts of their respective fan bases.</p>
<h2>4. Denver Broncos</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_854574" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-854574" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Peyton-Manning-Baltimore-Ravens-v-Denver-Broncos-W9O7oH1fdbRl.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos appear to be reinventing themselves on the fly. The Broncos, remember, were in the Super Bowl, as recently as 2013, after racking up 13 wins through the regular season. That year, Peyton Manning torched defenses for 5,477 yards and a record 55 touchdown passes to the likes of Wes Welker, Demaryius Thomas, and Julius Thomas. Last season, Manning was back at it again, completing 66% of his passes for 4,727 yards and 39 touchdowns and going 12-4.</p>
<p>Still, Manning and the Broncos lost at home to Andrew Luck and the Colts in the 2015 Divisional Playoff Round. In response, the Denver Broncos parted ways with head coach John Fox and brought in former backup quarterback, Gary Kubiak, who pledged to strengthen the team defense and running game in order to relieve his aging quarterback. This formula had mixed results this season, with Manning going for nine TDs and 17 INTs while compiling a 7-2 record as the starting quarterback.</p>
<p>Enter Brock Osweiler, who was apparently the quarterback of the future, with Manning being sidelined to battle a series of nagging injuries and an HGG accusation. For his part, Osweiler went 5-2, while managing the game and playing off a stingy defense. Still, Kubiak went on to reinsert Manning into the lineup in Week 17, before he led the Broncos to the go-ahead score over the San Diego Chargers. Gary Kubiak appears to be shuffling the deck at quarterback &#8212; at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>From here, Denver will have one bye week to bring Manning up to speed and get him in sync with his receivers. The white-hot Steelers, however, loom large as a matchup nightmare for the Broncos in the Divisional Playoff. Expect a visibly frazzled Manning to take brutal shots behind the line of scrimmage, cough the ball up, toss floating picks into double coverage, and take another cold-weather postseason loss at home.</p>
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>3. Washington Redskins</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_698488" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-698488" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/455440242-640x425.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>In late October, Kirk Cousins barged through his team tunnel and shouted, “You like that?” &#8212; after going 33-for-40 for 317 yards and three touchdowns to headline a 24-point comeback win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. From there, Cousins went on to light up the competition, throwing for 2,429 yards and 20 touchdowns against only three picks over the next nine games.</p>
<p>The Redskins, behind Cousins, did win their last four games to close out the season at 9-7. This mark was good enough to win the much-maligned NFC East, where both Chip Kelly and Tom Coughlin have already been shown the door. Outside of the NFC East, Washington squared off against only two other playoff-worthy opponents all year. New England and Carolina dominated the Redskins by a combined 71-26 score, after showing them multiple looks to stack the box at the line of scrimmage, while providing safety help over the top to corral speedster, DeSean Jackson.</p>
<p>Washington will host Green Bay to kick off wild-card weekend. The Packers, of course, went 6-0 to open the regular season, and they are always a dangerous team that can score with Aaron Rodgers under center. Expect the battle-tested Rodgers to keep the pressure on the Washington Redskins early and often, until this young team folds up and quits, before shopping around the mercurial Robert Griffin III to the highest bidder.</p>
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>2. Cincinnati Bengals</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_679931" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-679931" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Orson-Charles-Scott-Halleran-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Pittsburgh offensive tackle Marcus Gilbert is already relishing the idea of matching up against the Cincinnati Bengals in the playoffs, “<a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000601341/article/steelers-ot-wants-to-face-choking-bengals-in-playoffs" target="_blank">where they choke</a>.” Gilbert took to Twitter to call out his hated AFC North division rivals after winning an especially physical 33-20 bloodbath in Cincinnati. The Bengals are 0-6 in the playoffs under head coach Marvin Lewis, after many first-round letdowns.</p>
<p>Cincinnati did appear to be leaving its “Bungles” reputation in the past this year, evolving into a serious championship contender. They raced to an 8-0 record to open the regular season, with a more aggressive Andy Dalton taking his shots downfield. In all, the Red Rifle completed 66% of his passes for 3,250 yards and 25 touchdowns against only seven touchdowns &#8212; after being dismissed as a mere game manager through earlier parts of his career.</p>
<p>Dalton, however, fractured his thumb in a Week 14 loss to the Steelers and is now out for the remainder of the season. In his place, former Alabama signal caller A.J. McCarron has held serve, by completing 66% of his passes and winning two games in his own right. Still, if the Bengals find themselves in a shootout against Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, and the high octane Steelers, young McCarron may start pressing late and turning the ball over. Pittsburgh is the team that nobody wants to play.</p>

<h2>1. Carolina Panthers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_869901" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-869901" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Cam-Newton-Carolina-Panthers-v-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-E7GDNRwhFF_l.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="522" /> Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers are the most surprising team in all of sports, let alone the game of football. Last season, the Panthers went 7-8-1 and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/car/" target="_blank">somehow managed to win the NFC South</a>. For this, Carolina hosted a playoff game against Arizona, which they won before heading off to Seattle and getting blown out of the building 31-17 in the Divisional Playoffs.</p>
<p>This offseason, leading wide out Kelvin Benjamin injured his knee right before shocking footage was released of Cam Newton brawling with his teammates at practice. By midseason, however, Newton had established himself as the league MVP, with Carolina threatening to go undefeated. The team suffered its first and only loss in Week 16 to the Atlanta Falcons and did close out the season as the top-rated offense in football, putting up 32 points per game.</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers appear to be on a collision course against the Seattle Seahawks at home in the Divisional Playoffs. The Seahawks are coming off an impressive 36-6 road win in Arizona, with Russell Wilson suddenly catching fire for 1,906 passing yards and 24 touchdowns over the course of his last seven games. Wilson, of course, filled in last season in Super Bowl XLIX, where he threw an interception at the goal line to Malcolm Butler and the Patriots. Certainly, Wilson and the Seahawks will be out for payback during another march toward the Lombardi Trophy.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that the 2015 NFL Playoff brackets have been set, here is a look at our postseason power rankings heading into Wild Card weekend.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the <a title="National Football League Cheat Sheet" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/?ref=TN" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, Pro Bowlers are made during the regular season, and legends are made during the postseason. With the regular season now officially in the books and the <a title="2015 NFL Playoffs Bracket" href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl-news/4690021-nfl-playoffs-2016-afc-nfc-matchups-wild-card-schedule-seeds-sites-bracket-super-bowl-50" target="_blank">playoff brackets in both conferences set</a>, we thought it would be a good idea to take a look at how each of the remaining 12 teams compare to each other. As you read on, you will notice that there was some subjectivity involved with our rankings, as we placed more of an emphasis on each team’s current level of play, rather than strictly looking at overall records.With that being said, here is a look at our NFL Playoff power rankings heading into Wild Card weekend.
<h2>12.  Green Bay Packers (10-6)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_923568" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923568" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Aaron-Rodgers_Wesley-Hitt_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Wesley Hitt/Getty Images" width="757" height="525" /> Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]

Things just haven’t been the same for the Packers since their Week 8 loss to the <a title="Denver Broncos" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/den" target="_blank">Denver Broncos</a>. We still believe that <a title="Aaron Rodgers" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RodgAa00.htm" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers</a> is the best quarterback in football, but when he spends the majority of his time on the field running for his life, it makes it nearly impossible for him to do what he does best. For the Packers to make a serious postseason run, they will need to improve dramatically in every aspect of the game, which is something we don’t see happening.
<h2>11.  Washington Redskins (9-7)</h2>
The Redskins are the surprise team of the NFL Playoffs this year, and with the way their quarterback, <a title="Kirk Cousins" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CousKi00.htm" target="_blank">Kirk Cousins</a>, has been playing over the last month, we wouldn’t be surprised to see them knock off the Packers on Wild Card weekend. While they are still far from being a finished product, the Redskins look like they have the building blocks to develop into one of the NFC’s top teams for years to come.
<h2>10.  Houston Texans (9-7)</h2>
The Texans are a team that could easily sneak up on their opponents this postseason. Their defense, led by likely 2015 NFL Defensive Player of the Year <a title="J.J. Watt" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm" target="_blank">J.J. Watt</a>, has the ability to suffocate opposing offenses. However, the key to the Texans having any kind of playoff success is their offense – specifically quarterback <a title="Brian Hoyer" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HoyeBr00.htm" target="_blank">Brian Hoyer</a>. If Hoyer plays at a high level, this team can play with any other team in the AFC. If he struggles, they will likely be making an early postseason exit.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9.  Cincinnati Bengals (12-4)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_923579" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923579" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AJ-McCarron_Andrew-Weber_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Andrew Weber/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Andrew Weber/Getty Images[/caption]

The Bengals undoubtedly have one of the most talented rosters in the league, but without starting quarterback <a title="Andy Dalton" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaltAn00.htm" target="_blank">Andy Dalton</a>, it’s hard for us to consider them serious Super Bowl contenders. The good news for Cincinnati is that Dalton will likely be healthy in time for the Divisional round. The bad news is that the Bengals will first have to get through one of the most talented teams in the league, the <a title="Pittsburgh Steelers" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/pit" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, on Wild Card weekend for that to even be a possibility.
<h2>8.  Minnesota Vikings (11-5)</h2>
Their best player, running back <a title="Adrian Peterson" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PeteAd01.htm" target="_blank">Adrian Peterson</a>, may be 30-years-old, but that doesn’t change the fact that the Vikings have one of the most talented young rosters in the league. They have all of the pieces in place (assuming Peterson is healthy) to make a surprise run in the NFC Playoffs, but may find it hard to do so with the depth of the NFC this season.
<h2>7.  Kansas City Chiefs (11-5)</h2>
The Chiefs may be the hottest team in the entire league right now. They have won 10-straight games, which is a remarkable feat in today’s NFL, even if only two of those wins came against 2015 playoff teams. The postseason success of this team will likely come down to the health of outside linebackers <a title="Justin Houston" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HousJu00.htm" target="_blank">Justin Houston</a> and <a title="Tamba Hali" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HaliTa20.htm" target="_blank">Tamba Hali</a>, as well as the play of quarterback <a title="Alex Smith" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SmitAl03.htm" target="_blank">Alex Smith</a>.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>6.  Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_923584" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Antonio-Brown-Ben-Roethlisberger_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-923584" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Antonio-Brown-Ben-Roethlisberger_Gregory-Shamus_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="558" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]

The Steelers are hands down one of the most dangerous teams in the AFC. When their offense is clicking, there may not be a better offensive unit in the league. Ben Roethlisberger is arguably the best big-game quarterback in the business, and his arsenal of weapons, led by All-Pro wide receiver Antonio Brown, may also be the best in the league. The key to their postseason success, though, will be their young, and relatively untested, defense.
<h2>5.  New England Patriots (12-4)</h2>
If the Patriots were completely healthy, they would rank much higher on this list. As it stands, it seems like every key player on New England’s roster – including quarterback <a title="Tom Brady" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> and tight end <a title="Rob Gronkowski" href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GronRo00.htm" target="_blank">Rob Gronkowski</a> – is dealing with some sort of nagging injury. While the Patriots are still among the elite teams in the league, it’s hard to believe that they will be able to win another Super Bowl without their roster being full strength (or close to it).
<h2>4.  Seattle Seahawks (10-6)</h2>
The Seahawks appear to be peaking at just the right time as evidenced by their 36-6 drubbing of the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17. And with All-Pro running back Marshawn Lynch set to return to the field this week, the Seahawks will only be getting stronger. We wouldn’t be the least bit surprised to see the Seahawks win their third-straight NFC title, despite entering the NFL Playoffs as the NFC’s No. 6 seed.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3.  Denver Broncos (12-4)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_923590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Peyton-Manning-Ronnie-Hillman_Sean-M.-Haffey_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images[/caption]

If the Broncos ever truly get things figured out offensively, there is a good chance that they will be hoisting the Lombardi Trophy as Super Bowl 50 champions. As is, the Broncos have the best defense in the league and a subpar offense. That could all change, however, with Peyton Manning nearing full health and likely<a title="Why the Broncos Need to Start Manning" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-playoffs-why-the-broncos-need-to-start-peyton-manning.html/" target="_blank"> reclaiming his position</a> as the team’s starting quarterback.
<h2>2.  Carolina Panthers (15-1)</h2>
All the Panthers do is win. They will be without cornerback Charles Tillman for the playoffs, but we are confident that their defense won’t skip a beat without the 13-year NFL veteran on the field. If quarterback Cam Newton continues to play at an MVP-caliber level, this team has to be considered one of the Super Bowl 50 front-runners.
<h2>1.  Arizona Cardinals (13-3)</h2>
We are fully aware that the Cardinals are without safety Tyrann Mathieu and that they got crushed by the Seahawks by a score of 36-6 in Week 17. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that this is the most complete team in the league. Carson Palmer has been one of the best quarterbacks in the league all season, and their defense has very few (if any) weaknesses. Heading into Wild Card weekend, we see the Cardinals as the favorites to win the Super Bowl 50 title.

		<description><![CDATA[In a matchup between two surging teams, the Chiefs and Texans will square off in the opening round of the NFL playoffs. Which team has the edge?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_923086" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923086" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kansas-City-Chiefs-v-Houston-Texans-NY23Cnnyi5Ul.jpg" alt="Bob Levey/Getty Images" width="757" height="520" /> Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For much of the season, a playoff matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans seemed farfetched. Before the season began, Houston wasn&#8217;t expected to make the postseason at all, as the Indianapolis Colts were the clear favorite in the AFC South. As for Kansas City, a 1-5 start supposedly sank a team that many thought would contend for the AFC West title. Now, we enter Wildcard Weekend with a Chiefs versus Texans matchup among the competitors on the four-game slate.</p>
<p>The Texans seems to be the underdog, despite playing at home, and actually hold a record that is two wins short of the Chiefs&#8217; mark (9-7 versus 11-5). This causes many to assume that the Chiefs should roll in this game, but their playoff success has been nonexistent since the &#8217;90s, so it remains debatable if the franchise can actually win a postseason game. With that, here are the strengths and weaknesses of this matchup, which will ultimately determine the victor of this contest.</p>
<h2>Breaking down the Texans</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_901393" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-901393" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/J-J-Watt-New-Orleans-Saints-v-Houston-Texans-wtyOYklcnlhl.jpg" alt="Bob Levey/Getty Images" width="757" height="519" /> Bob Levey/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For the Houston Texans, the 2015 regular season was truly about overcoming adversity and finding a way. After beginning the season with a 1-4 record &#8212; including a loss to Kansas City in the season opener &#8212; the team finished 8-3 over its final 11 games (one of the better marks in the league over that time span). During that early stretch, the Texans struggled mightily on defense, giving up multiple 40-point performances in their first seven games. Their defense, led by J.J Watt (who led the league in sacks), figured it out though after a blow out loss to the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>The Texans&#8217; defense consistently held teams to under 10 points week in and week out, as they ultimately ended up as the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/totalPointsPerGame/position/defense" target="_blank">seventh stingiest unit</a> in the NFL. The emergence of the defensive side of things has been integral in Houston&#8217;s division-winning season. On offense, things could be better for the Texans. It&#8217;s been a bit of a carousel at quarterback, as the team has had four different starters at signal caller this season.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HoyeBr00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Brian Hoyer</a> will likely be the man getting the call in this game, which is probably the right choice. The inconsistency at starter, though, has led to a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/totalPointsPerGame" target="_blank">relatively low scoring offense</a>. Outside of the quarterback position, the only true threat for Houston is the dynamic <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HopkDe00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DeAndre Hopkins</a>, who broke out to have the third-highest receiving yardage total in the league this season. If the defense is as dynamic as they have been down the stretch, Houston will be a tough team for Kansas City to beat. If the defense struggles though, the Texans could be in for a long day.</p>

<h2>Breaking down the Chiefs</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_798014" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-798014 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Eric-Berry-e1431012211842.jpg" alt="KANSAS CITY, MO - JANUARY 09: Safety &lt;a rel=" width="757" height="518" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Since that 1-5 start, everything has gone well for the Kansas City Chiefs. As the winners of 10 straight games &#8212; the longest active streak in the league &#8212; the team has used an offense that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/givetake" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t turn the ball over</a> and a defense that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/totalPointsPerGame/position/defense" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t give up a lot of points</a> to take care of business. It&#8217;s not highlight-reel football that the Chiefs play. Instead, it&#8217;s a team brand of football that is producing all of these wins. Diving into that defense, there is talent at every level.</p>
<p>Eric Berry has returned to help lead the unit at safety. Rookie corner <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PeteMa00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marcus Peters</a> actually leads the league in interceptions. Linebackers <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/player_search.fcgi?search=Derrick+Johnson&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Derrick Johnson</a> and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HousJu00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Justin Houston</a> are as good as they come at that position. This doesn&#8217;t even include the defensive line, but players like those are the reason that Kansas City has been dominant on defense, especially during their current winning streak. They get sacks, they force turnovers, and they keep teams out of the end zone. That&#8217;s all you can ask out of an NFL defense.</p>
<p>Offensively, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/player_search.fcgi?search=Alex+Smith&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alex Smith</a> has played efficiently at quarterback, completing over 65% of his passes and only throwing 7 picks all season. The loss of running back <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CharJa00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jamaal Charles</a> early in the season was huge, but Kansas City found a way to be effective on the ground. The addition of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MaclJe00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jeremy Maclin</a> at receiver has been underrated. With over 1,000 yards and 8 touchdowns, Maclin (and tight end <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KelcTr00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Travis Kelce</a>) has been critical in adding another dimension to the Chiefs&#8217; offense. Again, nothing the Chiefs do is particularly exciting, but they have found a winning formula and it works to perfection right now. It&#8217;s like the old saying goes, &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it."</p>
<h2>The outcome</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_902659" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-902659" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Justin-Houston-Hannah-Foslien-Getty-Images-640x426.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Home-field advantage is definitely a nice thing to have in the NFL, especially in the postseason. Sometimes having that edge simply doesn&#8217;t matter though. We think that&#8217;ll be the case when Houston hosts Kansas City on Saturday. Kansas City is, frankly, the better team in this matchup. They have more on offense and defense, which should allow them to control this game from start to finish. It&#8217;s nothing against the Texans; Kansas City is probably better than most teams in the NFL right now. Houston will put up a fight (no doubt), but we see the Chiefs breaking that playoff drought and moving on to the divisional round.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[In yet another chapter of the AFC North rivalry, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati will square off in primetime during Wild Card Weekend.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_923052" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923052" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Antonio-Brown-Pittsburgh-Steelers-v-Cincinnati-7_8oNpSAtTXl.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Historically, the NFL playoffs reward us for sticking through the long, 16-game regular season by generating can&#8217;t-miss matchups. That will definitely be the case when two AFC North rivals square off in primetime on Saturday night to get the ball rolling on the 2015-16 postseason. These two rivals are the Cincinnati Bengals (who will host the game) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (maybe the luckiest team in professional sports). Whenever two familiar opponents get together, the result is usually an entertaining, well-fought game. Add in the playoff atmosphere and you could have the game of the weekend in Cincinnati. With that, here&#8217;s our breakdown of the Wild Card Weekend matchup, along with our predicted outcome.</p>
<h2>The case for the Steelers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_923054" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923054" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Roethlisberger-Pittsburgh-Steelers-v-Cleveland-TgSZsTwyq_nl.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="519" /> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Pittsburgh was a bit wishy-washy this season, losing to opponents they should have beaten, such as the Ravens, and beating opponents they could have easily lost to, like the Broncos. Despite their somewhat inconsistent play, the Steelers found a way to sneak into the postseason (thanks in part to the Buffalo Bills) as the No. 6 seed in the AFC. What you have to like about Pittsburgh is pretty obvious. Their offense has <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total" target="_blank">turned into one of the best in the league</a> behind <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RoetBe00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ben Roethlisberger</a>, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/player_search.fcgi?search=Antonio+Brown&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Antonio Brown</a>, and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WillDe02.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DeAngelo Williams</a>. They constantly make big plays and can overcome even the largest deficits (ask the Broncos).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Steelers defense has been suspect at times, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/position/defense" target="_blank">ranking in the bottom half of the league</a> in yards allowed. Their <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/givetake/sort/giveTotal/position/defense" target="_blank">high number of giveaways</a> is also a concern, especially since postseason games are generally pretty close and often come down to a handful of plays. Overall, the Steelers&#8217; roster looks strong. If they get rolling on offense, they become nearly impossible to beat. They are also decently healthy, although the status of Williams is questionable at this point. Regardless, they should give Cincinnati plenty of problems when they face off on Saturday.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>The case for the Bengals</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_923062" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923062" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/j-Green-Cincinnati-Bengals-v-Pittsburgh-Steelers-MbTPNLhG5frl.jpg" alt="Justin K. Aller/Getty Images" width="757" height="513" /> Justin K. Aller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>After beginning the season 8-0, many were ready to include the Bengals in the conversation of Super Bowl favorites. Since then, however, things have taken a turn for this talented roster. While the defense is playing well, the loss of QB <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DaltAn00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Andy Dalton</a> is a major concern for Cincinnati as they begin their playoff run. Dalton was having an MVP-caliber season before injuring his thumb a few weeks ago, and his status is uncertain at best for this game against Pittsburgh. Dalton&#8217;s absence really affects the ability of the offense to consistently produce points and sustain drives.</p>
<p>If Dalton can&#8217;t play, the Bengals will have to rely on second-year pro <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McCaA.00.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">A.J. McCarron</a> to lead to offense. McCarron has been solid at quarterback, but he doesn&#8217;t have the same level of experience as Dalton. Cincinnati could do much worse at backup, but not having their regular starter could set them back in a big way this weekend. As we mentioned, the Bengals&#8217; defense is good enough to win this game and others in the postseason &#8212; even if their offense isn&#8217;t producing.</p>
<p>Behind players like <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DunlCa99.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carlos Dunlap</a> and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AtkiGe99.htm?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Geno Atkins</a>, their defense <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/totalPointsPerGame/position/defense" target="_blank">ranks second in the league</a> in points allowed (the most critical defensive statistic).  They know how to create pressure and how to create turnovers, making them one of the most dangerous units in the NFL. Not having Dalton hurts, but Cincinnati still has more than enough skill to win this game, which would earn them their first postseason victory since 1990.</p>
<h2>So, who wins?</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_923078" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-923078" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Martavis-Bryant-Indianapolis-Colts-v-Pittsburgh-nyfolDmzqOdl.jpg" alt="Joe Sargent/Getty Images " width="757" height="503" /> Joe Sargent/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>This should be a tight matchup that will test one of the best offenses in the league against one of the best defenses in the league. Of all the games during Wild Card Weekend, this one seems to have the best chance of producing a memorable outcome. It should absolutely be a part of any NFL fan&#8217;s plans on Saturday evening. With that said, we think that Pittsburgh has more momentum at this point and, frankly, a better overall roster. Their ability to make plays versus the Bengals&#8217; potential inability to do so should be too much for Cincinnati to overcome. Despite being the road team, expect the Steelers to pull out the win.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Dallas Cowboys are in desperate need of a backup quarterback behind Tony Romo. The question is, who could it be?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this point, it&#8217;s blatantly obvious that the Dallas Cowboys need to find a solid quarterback behind Tony Romo for the 2016 season and beyond. There&#8217;s little question that Romo will start next year, and will likely continue to play for a few more years, barring unforeseen happenings. If that&#8217;s the case, the 2015 season showed everyone that the Cowboys need to find the future after Romo, or at least a true backup quarterback who could fill in if something happened to him.</p>
<p>So, we saw Brandon Weeden, Matt Cassel, and Kellen Moore all play for the Cowboys this season, and the results were essentially terrible. Dallas was 3-1 in games Romo started and 1-11 in games any other quarterback started. This means it&#8217;s time to talk about potential backups for Romo, whether through a trade, free agency, or the 2016 NFL draft. We&#8217;ll start out with one of the non-sexy names that fans may not fully be on board with yet.</p>
<h2>1. Kellen Moore</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_924906" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-924906" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Kellen-Moore-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="ARLINGTON, TX - JANUARY 03: Kellen Moore #17 of the Dallas Cowboys throws against the Washington Redskins during the first half at AT&amp;T Stadium on January 3, 2016 in Arlington, Texas." width="757" height="515" /> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>After watching <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MoorKe02.htm" target="_blank">Moore</a> play in three games for the Cowboys to finish the 2015 season, it&#8217;s obvious that he definitely has some upside. He struggled at times, but finished with a 435-yard, three-touchdown performance against the Washington Redskins in the season finale. The biggest issue for Moore was turnovers, as he threw 6 interceptions in those three games. While Moore may not be a future starter in this league, Todd Archer of ESPN reported that Jerry Jones recently said he believes Moore is a <a title="viable No. 2 quarterback" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4748656/jerry-jones-sees-kellen-moore-as-viable-no-2-qb" target="_blank">feasible No. 2 quarterback</a> in this league.</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s great to hear, it doesn&#8217;t answer the question about who could be the future at the position for the Cowboys. We&#8217;re right there with Jones, as Moore seems more like a backup at this point, but he did show some upside. Don&#8217;t be shocked if Moore is on the roster next season, but not as the No. 2 quarterback, since Dallas will likely make a move to bring in additional talent at the position.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Johnny Manziel</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_687874" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-687874" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/453825028-640x425.jpg" alt="TJ Root/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> TJ Root/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>They might be growing old at this point, but the rumors of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/ManzJo00.htm" target="_blank">Johnny Manziel</a> heading to Dallas are hotter than they&#8217;ve ever been. The Browns seem to be completely done with him, and while he obviously comes with baggage, it&#8217;s probably a safe bet that Jones is sitting back, staring at the opportunity to land a quarterback who he truly coveted during the draft. Best of all? He&#8217;d get Manziel for a massively discounted rate.</p>
<p>The Browns probably won&#8217;t move Manziel yet, largely due to the fact that they&#8217;re completely rebuilding their front office, but the good news is that Manziel at least showed some on-field growth in 2015. He threw for 1,500 yards, 7 touchdowns and 5 interceptions in scattered action. Manziel isn&#8217;t there yet, but with a few seasons to sit behind Romo and learn, he could wind up being the future of Cowboys football. Don&#8217;t ignore the Manziel situation this offseason, although you probably couldn&#8217;t if you tried.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Robert Griffin III</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_916964" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-916964" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Robert-Griffin-III-Patrick-Smith-Getty-Images-640x427.jpg" alt="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> Patrick Smith/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Washington Redskins have their quarterback in Kirk Cousins, so it&#8217;s time for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GrifRo01.htm" target="_blank">Robert Griffin III</a> to look for a new home. It&#8217;s pretty obvious that the Redskins will part ways with Griffin this offseason, and as Sports Illustrated reported, he made it known that he <a title="wants to sign with Dallas" href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2016/01/06/washington-redskins-rg3-dallas-cowboys" target="_blank">wants to sign with Dallas</a> if he gets released. So, there you have it, Dallas&#8217;s next quarterback, right? Well, maybe. Griffin didn&#8217;t play at all in 2015, but he put together a pretty solid resume.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason to believe that Griffin can&#8217;t succeed in the right situation, and landing in Dallas may be that occasion. At the very least, Dallas may be crazy not to give him a shot and assess if he can still be anything close to the quarterback we saw during his rookie year. Back in 2012, RGIII threw for 3,200 yards, 20 touchdowns and just 5 interceptions, while rushing for 815 yards and 7 touchdowns.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Paxton Lynch</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_878445" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-878445" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Paxton-Lynch-Miami-Beach-Bowl-CyWpSMj4iMKl.jpg" alt="Rob Foldy/Getty Images" width="757" height="501" /> Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The junior quarterback for the Memphis Tigers has gotten better and better over his three seasons, with his most recent being by far the best. <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/paxton-lynch-1.html" target="_blank">Paxton Lynch</a> completed 66.8% of his passes, while throwing 28 touchdowns against just 4 interceptions. We also saw Lynch&#8217;s ability to beat opponents with his legs, as he has 17 total rushing touchdowns in his collegiate career.</p>
<p>Lynch is one of the most intriguing quarterback prospects in this class, and there&#8217;s a good chance he&#8217;ll be there when Dallas picks at No. 4. One real issue we see with Lynch is what happened when he faced the Auburn Tigers in the Birmingham Bowl in 2015. He was up against a different caliber of defense, and he completed just 16 of 37 passes for 106 yards and 1 interception in that game. Cause for concern? Absolutely, but he&#8217;ll have time to learn before being forced into action in the NFL.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>5. Jared Goff</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_853737" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-853737" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jared-Goff-Stanford-v-California-hSh4-C__WAcl.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Time to look at another very intriguing rookie quarterback in <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/jared-goff-1.html" target="_blank">Jared Goff</a>. The California Golden Bears quarterback has been a complete and total stud over the past two years. During that span, he&#8217;s thrown for 8,692 yards, an amazing 78 touchdowns, and 20 interceptions. On paper, Goff is an incredible prospect with the type of upside that should leave NFL teams drooling over him, rightfully so.</p>
<p>In 2015 alone &#8212; if you remove one tough showing against Utah when Goff threw 5 interceptions &#8212; his numbers are even more amazing. Goff very well may be the quarterback who Jones and the Cowboys target as their future, and it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising at all if Jones jumps at the chance to sign him. It&#8217;ll be tough to choose between Lynch and Goff, but if it comes to that, it would be hard to bet against what Goff brings to the table.</p>

<p>In the modern era, NFL fullback has emerged as one of the most thankless job titles in all of sport, arguably as obsolete as the VCR. The greatest NFL fullbacks of all time are all throwbacks to an era of American football fans that would barely be able to recognize today’s pass-happy, shotgun spread league. Long gone are the days of the wishbone, split backs, and the Power I formation. The modern game of football has evolved into single back, four-wide-receiver sets, with a fullback often posted up on the bench, hat in hand.</p>
<p>Today’s fan would actually describe the all-time great fullbacks as pure running backs: Jim Brown, Earl Campbell, and Jim Taylor. Categorizations for the greatest fullbacks of all time serve as testimony to how much this position has evolved.</p>
<p>At first, the fullback was the Smash half of the Smash and Dash equation. Old School Frozen Tundra rushing attacks paired a relatively swift fullback alongside a scat halfback to terrorize defenses. Eventually, the tall and graceful fullback gave way to the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s burly bowling ball &#8212; that still had just enough gas to go the distance and take it to the house. In the 1990s, the NFL fullback lost his neck, but still kept his Middle America crew cut. These lunch pail brutes were happy to block at the point of attack, catch a bone out in the flat, and keep their respective mouths shut, as the ultimate team players.</p>
<p>Ranking the greatest NFL fullbacks of all time is less about stats, but more so about how these players matched up against the expectations of their respective eras. One last note: Tampa Bay Buccaneers Legend Mike Alstott deserves an honorable mention.</p>

<h4>10. Larry Csonka</h4>
<p>Larry Csonka was power football. At 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, Csonka is an anomaly for modern day fans that associate Miami with pretty boy Dan Marino quarterbacking and South Beach linen suits. The &#8217;70s Dolphins, however, were a smash mouth outfit that combined the grit of Csonka and clutch passing of Bob Griese, alongside their dominant no-name defense to take home back-to-back Super Bowl trophies in 1972-1973. Csonka especially ran wild in Super Bowl VIII, when he gashed the Minnesota Vikings for 145 yards, 2 touchdowns, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/mvp/sbviii" target="_blank">and one MVP award</a>.</p>
<p>Csonka put together three consecutive 1,000-yard (14-game) seasons during the halcyon days of Miami Dolphin football in the early 1970s. Impressively, Csonka led the NFL with his 5.4 yards per carry average in 1971, which was basically unheard of for a big back. Csonka completed <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CsonLa00.htm" target="_blank">his 11-year career</a> with 8,081 rushing yards.</p>

<h4>9. John Riggins</h4>
<p>Riggo will forever be a Washington, D.C. legend, as he was recognized for his barreling runs, as much as he was for his playboy lifestyle. A toast of the town, John Riggins was the proverbial Good Ol&#8217; Boy in a pick up truck, who happened to slap on a helmet on Game Day. Vintage Riggins went off tackle on 4th and inches <a href="http://www.redskins.com/media-gallery/videos/John-Riggins-Super-Bowl-XVII-43-yard-TD-run/7eacf16a-e6b7-474d-b7c1-759198963a5b" target="_blank">in Super Bowl XVII</a>, ran over a hapless Miami Dolphin defensive back, and burst into the clear for a 43-yard touchdown gallop.</p>
<p>In a 14-year career with the Washington Redskins and New York Jets, Riggo <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiggJo00.htm" target="_blank">tallied 13,442 total yards from scrimmage</a> alongside 116 total touchdowns. As of 2010, Riggins’s 104 rushing touchdowns are good for sixth of all time. Remarkably, The Diesel was to keep the engine going well past 30, when a running back is supposed to be past his prime. Riggins had his best season in 1983, when he racked up 1,347 rushing yards and a league-best 24 touchdowns, at the age of 34.</p>

<h4>8. Jim Taylor</h4>
<p>Jim Taylorand Paul Hornung (Thunder and Lightning, respectively) evoke memories of the Vince Lombardi days of yore, with a seal here and a seal there on the toss sweep. Although Taylor played at a diminutive 6-feet and 215 pounds, the man was known to get physical on the Frozen Tundra. In true fullback form, Taylor was a straight line back who never shied away from direct contact with oncoming linebackers at the point of attack. As a Packer, Taylor won three NFL championships and the first Super Bowl.</p>
<p>During his era, Taylor was second only to Jim Brown, in terms of production out of the backfield. At retirement, Taylor’s 83 total touchdowns ranked seond behind Brown, and in 1962 <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1962/leaders.htm" target="_blank">Taylor led the NFL</a> with 1,474 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns. On the 14-game season, Taylor averaged 105 yards per game for the Packers. Save Brown, Jim Taylor was the only back to lead the NFL in rushing between 1957 and 1965.</p>

<h4>7. Daryl Johnston and Tom Rathman</h4>
<p>Paired together in this  because they were so close to being one and the same, Daryl Johnston and Tom Rathman were both symbolic of the dirty work that solidified &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s dynasties at Dallas and San Francisco, respectively. Lead blocking, sure hands, no neck, crew cut hair, and a fawning John Madden on speed dial were also trademarks of this throwback brand.</p>
<p>Daryl Johnston and Tom Rathman were built to play fullback in the 1980s and 1990s. Rathman, from Grand Island, Neb., starred as an option fullback for Big Red. As a Cornhusker, Rathman simply took the football and ran straight ahead. Rathman brought these same talents to San Francisco, where he performed as the unsung hero of the West Coast Offense – in the shadows of Joe Montana, Steve Young, Jerry Rice, and Roger Craig.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Daryl Johnston was opening up holes for Emmitt Smith, the NFL’s all time rushing leader, on the lead draw. Johnston was a devastating blocker out of the I-formation, who Smith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIX6fXbsyZs" target="_blank">credited as key to his success</a>. Between the two, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RathTo00.htm" target="_blank">Rathman</a> and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnDa00.htm" target="_blank">Johnston</a> accounted for 2,773 rushing yards, 614 catches, and 4,911 receiving yards. Pity the diminutive defensive backs that were ever trusted with the assignment of taking out Tom Rathman or Daryl Johnston out in the flat – with a full head of steam. Moooooooose.</p>

<h4>6. Franco Harris</h4>
<p>With a playing career spanning between 1972 and 1984, Franco Harris was the last example of a smooth-running fullback. Franco was just too pretty for most fans to acknowledge the fact that he shared the same job title with the likes of Tom Rathman and Bronco Nagurski. In Pittsburgh, the roles were indeed reversed behind the steel curtain. At halfback, Rocky Bleier was the gritty kid that nearly got his leg blown off in ‘Nam, but returned to the Steel City to run over people. At fullback, Harris dazzled crowds with his long strides and instant acceleration.</p>
<p>Of course, Franco will always be hailed as the final cog in the Immaculate Reception, when he <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2012/12/18/immaculate-reception-40th-anniversary/1778589/" target="_blank">caught a ricochet off his shoelaces</a>, and sprinted toward pay dirt and a playoff victory.</p>
<p>Beyond the Immaculate Reception, the gallant Franco Harris was to finish up his career as a 9-time Pro Bowl selection and 4-time Super Bowl winner. Upon his retirement, Franco had compiled <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarrFr00.htm" target="_blank">12,120 total rushing yards</a>, just 192 yards short of Jim Brown’s then all time record of 12,312.</p>

<h4>5. Lorenzo Neal</h4>
<p>Lorenzo Neal was the greatest blocking fullback of all time. Between 1993 and 2008, Neal paved the way for Warrick Dunn, Eddie George, Corey Dillon, and LaDainian Tomlinson. In fact, Neal bludgeoned linebackers and shielded the edge to lead a 1,000-yard rusher into the clear for <a href="http://www.footballuniversity.org/lorenzo-neal" target="_blank">11 straight years</a>.</p>
<p>On paper, Neal’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NealLo00.htm" target="_blank">career statistics</a> appear minimal, as he needed 16 years to accumulate 807 rushing yards. On the field, however, Neal proved to be an indispensable member of any offense. As 6-feet and 260 pounds of muscle, Neal finished his career opening up running lanes for Baltimore – at the age of 38.</p>

<h4>4. Earl Campbell</h4>
<p>Known for his gargantuan thighs, Earl Campbell was a force. During his eight-year career, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CampEa00.htm" target="_blank">Campbell rushed for 9,407 yards</a> and 74 touchdowns. His 1980 campaign should be highlighted as the greatest season ever recorded by a workhorse back, when he used 373 carries, Campbell picked up 1,934 yards – for an impressive 5.2 yards per carry average for the Houston Oilers. At 5-foot-11, 245 pounds, with 4.5/40 speed, Campbell used his freakish combination of size and speed to terrorize opposing defenses and lead the NFL in rushing for three straight years – between 1978 and 1980.</p>
<p>As Houston’s meal ticket, Campbell toted the football for 302, 368, 373, 361, and 322 carries in full seasons between 1978 and 1983. Sadly, the amount of work combined with Campbell’s style of reckless abandon was to take its toll on the young star. By the age of 30, Campbell’s production collapsed and he was out of the league. After a career marked by brutality, Earl Campbell is <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs03/columns/story?id=1722403" target="_blank">often relegated to a wheelchair</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Bronko Nagurski</h4>
<p>The game of football has not, and will never see another player like Bronko Nagurski again. At 6-foot-2 and 226 pounds, Nagurski starred at fullback, linebacker, and offensive tackle for the 1930s Chicago Bears. Modern-era fans may imagine the likes of Anthony Munoz or Joe Thomas rotating into the backfield to take handoffs, and barrel over defenders in leather helmets. Although his statistics may appear pedestrian, Nagurski set the mold for all big backs that were to follow. As a fullback, Nagurski dragged would-be tacklers through the dirt – for 2,778 rushing yards and 25 touchdowns <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NaguBr00.htm" target="_blank">in 9 years</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Marion Motley</h4>
<p>At 6-foot-1 and 230 pounds, Marion Motley was a man amongst boys. Motley’s appearance and statistical record was synonymous to that of a high school game breaker, who simply overpowered the opposition for two and one half quarters before laughing it up on the bench for the rest of the game. As a 1946 Cleveland Browns rookie, Motley rushed for 601 yards on 73 attempts, for an unreal 8.2 yards per carry average. In <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=156" target="_blank">a 1950 game against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers</a>, Motley rushed for 188 yards on only 11 carries, for a record 17 yards per rush average.</p>
<p>In total, Motley’s 4,720 rushing yards were produced on a 5.7 yards per attempt average. Referred to as the Jackie Robinson of football, Motley was simply bigger and faster than everybody else. Motley teamed up with NFL pioneer Paul Brown in Cleveland to win four AAFC championships and one NFL championship.</p>

<h4>1. Jim Brown</h4>
<p>Jim Brown was the greatest NFL football player of all time. Brown dominated the NFL, and his totals over 12 and 14-game seasons look like they came straight out of a video game, regardless of the era. Brown <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowJi00.htm" target="_blank">completed a 9-year career</a> with 12,312 rushing yards and 106 touchdowns. Brown’s 5.2 yards per carry average is also significantly higher than <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_career.htm" target="_blank">the top two all-time rushing leaders</a>, Emmitt Smith (4.2) and Walter Payton (4.4).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Incredible as it may seem, we're just 12 years removed from the Raiders being in the Super Bowl. Their quarterbacks haven't helped alleviate that very much.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-732522 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Schaub-Dilip-Vishwanat-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s been just over a decade since Jon Gruden and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ran roughshod all over the Oakland Raiders in the Super Bowl. This is important, because that was the last time that the Raiders made it to the playoffs, let alone the second round of the playoffs, let alone the biggest game of the entire season.

There are many reasons for the team’s protracted slump, and a few of them are related to Al Davis, but one of the biggest things eluding the San Francisco Bay’s only remaining team has been its utter inability to find a quarterback who’s stuck.

To put it into some perspective, we decided to run down a tally of every quarterback who’s lead the Raiders in passing yardage for at least a season since that fateful evening in February 2002. You will recognize some of these names; you could be forgiven for missing some others. All data are courtesy of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com" target="_blank">Pro-Football-Reference</a>.

<h2>1. Rich Gannon, 2003</h2>
Gannon, who was also the Raiders’ quarterback during their Super Bowl appearance, managed to keep his job for another season, when he was the head of an offense that managed to be <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/" target="_blank">25th out of 32</a> when the dust settled. The Raiders moved on to greener pastures shortly thereafter, although Gannon remained on the roster until 2004, retiring at 39.
<h2>2. Kerry Collins, 2004 and 2005</h2>
From Gannon, the Raiders turned to Kerry Collins, who helmed the team for two seasons, submitting a 9-23 record over that time. At 33, Collins looked to be struggling, but upon departing the Raiders he had a marginally more successful time under center for the Tennessee Titans, including during their 2008 season, when they wound up atop the AFC South with a 13-3 record.
<h2>3. Andrew Walter, 2006</h2>
Drafted by the Raiders in 2005, Walter would turn out to be one of several busts in the organization’s efforts to find new talent through the annual selection process, as he only lasted three seasons in the NFL. Playing each of those in Oakland, Walter would <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WaltAn00.htm" target="_blank">only start in a total of nine games</a>, and the Raiders quickly abandoned their third-round selection for another aging signal caller.

<h2>4. Daunte Culpepper, 2007</h2>
Daunte Culpepper’s legacy as a Viking may elicit some minor controversy — he was a three-time Pro Bowler but unable to really get Minny to amount to anything during his tenure with the team — but there’s no such argument to be had about his stint with the Raiders. Throwing for just 1,331 yards, Culpepper managed to outgain nominal starter Josh McCown (now with Tampa Bay) despite starting in three fewer games, and lead the team’s <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200711250kan.htm" target="_blank">only fourth-quarter comeback of the year</a>. That was his only season in Oakland.
<h2>5. JaMarcus Russell, 2008 and 2009</h2>
Arguably the most infamous name on this list, JaMarcus Russell did not have nearly the success that he was expected to after a promising NCAA career and being the first overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. (That might be the understatement of the year.) Nevertheless, Russell managed to hang on as Oakland’s leading passer for two straight seasons before dropping out of the league entirely.
<h2>6. Jason Campbell, 2010</h2>
To his credit, journeyman quarterback Jason Campbell managed to lead the Raiders back to a .500 record for the first time since 2002 when he took over for Russell in 2010. The Raiders went 8-8, missing the playoffs but finishing third in the AFC West, a notable improvement. And then, just a few games into the 2011 season, Campbell broke his collarbone, and the front office decided to search for yet another veteran quarterback to solve the team’s problems.

<h2>7. Carson Palmer, 2011 and 2012</h2>
Enter Carson Palmer. In 2011, Palmer was sitting at home, cooling his heels as an unwilling retiree whose playing rights were owned by the Cincinnati Bengals, who were awful but refused to trade him. If he wasn’t going to play for the Bengals, he wasn’t going to play at all — or so it seemed. Once the Raiders <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7118158/oakland-raiders-acquire-carson-palmer-cincinnati-bengals" target="_blank">offered up a pair of picks</a>, one first-rounder and one second that could conditionally become a first, the tune changed, and Palmer suited up for Oakland, more or less looking like he’d still retired from the game. Palmer would eventually be traded to the Arizona Cardinals.
<h2>8. Terrelle Pryor, 2013</h2>
Consider him Oakland’s Tim Tebow — a mobile quarterback who couldn’t really throw. Despite being taken in the 2011 supplemental draft, Pyror really only got to shine in 2013, when he threw a lot and ran a lot and watched the Raiders lose a lot, as the team tied its 4-12 record from 2012. The Raiders, such is their wont, subsequently set out to find another solution at QB.
<h2>9. Derek Carr, 2014</h2>
And here we come to Derek Carr, brother of David Carr, who was also a Raiders quarterback in the days of yore. The Raiders finished 2014 with a  3-13 record, but there’s some silver lining for fans: At least a few anonymous NFL executives and front-office types <a href="http://www.thesidelineview.com/columns/middlekauff/scouting-trail-2015-nfl-draft-insights-gurley-cooper" target="_blank">would take Carr</a> over 49ers signal caller Colin Kaepernick. Chin up, Raiders fans. It can’t get much worse, can it?

<p>Aside from the punter, the placekicker is most certainly viewed as the least sexy position in football. Virtually no NFL fan grabs a cold one, chows down on a wide array of junk food, and turns on the television every Sunday afternoon, amped to sport a jersey supporting their favorite team&#8217;s kicker. If you&#8217;re an outlier who follows these under-appreciated athletes, good luck finding a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GostSt20.htm" target="_blank">Stephen Gostkowski</a> uni in any major sporting goods retail store.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, though placekickers (who kick field goals and perform kickoff duties) typically take the field a minimum of three or so times per game &#8212; and an upwards of five to 10 times with a highly potent offense &#8212; they are largely disregarded when discussing important players on the squads. Luckily, there are <a href="http://www.patriots.com/news/2015/11/18/stephen-gostkowski-named-afc-special-teams-player-week" target="_blank">weekly special teams awards</a> that honor kickers once in a while.</p>
<p>Despite their low rank on the NFL roster totem pole, kickers are perhaps the most undervalued entity to a team. It seems that at least two or three times a week, a contest will be decided on a game-winning field goal, a missed field goal, or another gem or miscue involving a kicker. True, in most cases the outcome is based on the performance of a quarterback, running back, wide receiver, or defensive unit, but we&#8217;ve seen time and time again that the Sebastian Janikowskis of the league can be a bigger factor. Anybody else remember <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2014/12/25/adam-vinatieri-ageless-wonder-nfls-last-man-standing/20875203/" target="_blank">Adam Vinatieri in the two Super Bowls</a>?</p>
<p>So, on the heels of the aforementioned Gostkowski&#8217;s big boot against the New York Giants on Sunday, let&#8217;s countdown the five best kickers in football today.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>5. Dan Bailey, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_804052" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-804052 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dallas-Cowboys.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="495" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>2015 statistics: 18/19 field goal attempts made, longest field goal made (53 yards), 16/16 extra point attempts made</h2>
<p>The most accurate kicker in NFL history, Dallas Cowboys&#8217; <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BailDa00.htm" target="_blank">Dan Bailey</a>, comes in at No. 5 on the list. Bailey <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4747200/dan-baileys-miss-a-sign-cowboys-karma-is-off" target="_blank">finally missed</a> his first field goal attempt of the season this past Sunday (pushing a 48-yard attempt wide right) but he still remains among the elite. The 27-year-old&#8217;s missed field goal broke up a string of 21 straight successful field goals dating back to last season. Bailey had been a perfect 16 of 16 this year with the new, slightly longer extra point attempts. Even with the rare miscue, Bailey is still <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/kicking/sort/fieldGoalsMade" target="_blank">tied for ninth</a> in field goals made and has a season-long make of 53 yards.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Brandon McManus, Denver Broncos</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_887120" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-887120" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brandon-McManus_Doug-Pensinger_Getty-Images-640x440.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="520" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>2015 statistics: 19/20 field goal attempts made, longest field goal made (57 yards), 20/20 extra point attempts made</h2>
<p>Coming into this season, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/McMaBr01.htm" target="_blank">Brandon McManus</a> probably thought he would have more than 40 field goal and extra point tries combined by now. However, due to a deteriorating Peyton Manning-led offense, the attempts have been somewhat limited for No. 8. While he has already surpassed his field goal makes from the 2014 season, he currently has less than half of last year&#8217;s 41 PAT attempts and makes with just seven games remaining. He&#8217;s clearly one of the best though, converting a perfect 20 of 20 on the point afters and missing just one field-goal try thus far. He&#8217;s gone 14 of 14 on field goals under 50 yards and has a <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/kicking/sort/longFieldGoalMade" target="_blank">season-long make</a> of 57 yards.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Steven Hauschka, Seattle Seahawks</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_747138" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-747138 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/CenturyLink-Field-Seattle-Seahawks-e1421412503154.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>2015 statistics: 20/21 field goal attempts made, longest field goal made (54 yards), 17/17 extra point attempts made</h2>
<p>During the Seattle Seahawks past couple runs to the Super Bowl, they&#8217;ve featured the young talent of quarterback Russell Wilson; the bruising, powerful beast of a running back in Marshawn Lynch; and of course, the &#8220;Legion of Boom" on defense. How about giving some love to their kicker, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HausSt00.htm" target="_blank">Steven Hauschka</a>? Since finding limited success from 2008 to 2010 with Baltimore and Denver, &#8220;Hausch Money" has been as consistent as they come over the past four-and-a-half seasons. Hauschka is a remarkable 219 of 222 on PATs in his regular season career &#8212; not missing one since his 2012 campaign. The 30-year-old is tied for fourth this year with his 20 field goal makes and is an impressive four of four on tries over 50 yards.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Josh Brown, New York Giants</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_743887" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-743887 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Giants-logo-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="417" /> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>2015 statistics: 23/23 field goal attempts made, longest field goal made (53 yards), 26/27 extra point attempts made</h2>
<p>At 36 years old, New York Giants placekicker <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/brownjos01.htm" target="_blank">Josh Brown</a> is the oldest of the group, yet he is still one of the most reliable in the league. After connecting on all four of his field goal attempts and punching through both PATs in <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/week_9.htm" target="_blank">Week 9</a>, Brown was named the NFC&#8217;s Special Teams Player of the Week. Overall, in 2015, he has converted 26 of 27 extra points and has a perfect 23-for-23 on field goals, including a season-long 53-yarder. He&#8217;s currently atop the league in field goals made and is tied for fourth in PATs. The majority of his field goals have not been chip shots either; 10 have been more than 40 yards and 19 have been over 30.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>1. Stephen Gostkowski, New England Patriots</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_803029" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-803029 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Patriots-PAT.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>2015 statistics: 21/21 field goal attempts made, longest field goal made (57 yards), 34/34 extra point attempts made</h2>
<p>With the hottest quarterback and the best tight end in the game, it seems unfair for the New England Patriots to also have the best kicker, right? Well, football isn&#8217;t fair, because the most clutch kicker in the business is the Pats&#8217; <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/9704/stephen-gostkowski" target="_blank">Stephen Gostkowski</a>, and he&#8217;s been the best for a handful of years now. Back in 2006, during his first season in New England, who would have thought that anyone could replace the legendary Adam Vinatieri? But No. 3 has done exactly that.</p>
<p>At 31, Gostkowski shows no signs of slowing down. He ranks third in field goals with 21 and is tied with McManus for a season-long of 57 yards. If you needed any further proof of just how dominating the Patriots offense is, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/kicking/sort/extraPointsMade" target="_blank">look at the lead</a> that Gostkowski shares in extra points with his 34. He and Arizona Cardinal Chandler Catanzaro are relishing in all of the PAT chances.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Philadelphia Eagles exemplify the values of their hometown like no other team in sports.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_779816" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-779816 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/McNabb-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="502" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles exemplify the values of their hometown like no other team in sports. Over time, the Eagles have come to be identified with mobile quarterbacks, swarming defense, and above all else, mental toughness. Philadelphia fans, of course, once pelted Santa Claus with snowballs at Veterans Stadium, and demand nothing less than true grit out of their beloved football team.</p>
<p>The best Eagles teams have all played with a chip upon their collective shoulder, as the New York Giants, Washington Redskins, and Dallas Cowboys have often overshadowed the franchise within the division. The Eagles have made two appearances in the Super Bowl, in 1980 and 2004, losing both. The 2004 Super Bowl run was part of a dominant stretch where Philadelphia made four consecutive trips to the NFC Championship Game. Taken as a group, the five greatest Philadelphia Eagles of all time laid everything out on the line to deliver this franchise to the Promised Land, even if they ultimately came up short.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_779818" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-779818 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/White-Streeter-Lecka-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="501" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>1. Reggie White</h2>
<p>Reggie White earned the title “Minister of Defense” in Philadelphia at left defensive end, and was especially notable for his hump move, where he would explode off the line, shrug his shoulders, and club the opposing tackle with a forearm shiver before cutting back to the inside. In run support, Reggie White would often chase down ball carriers from the weak side to make tackles. As a pass rusher, Reggie White terrorized quarterbacks <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WhitRe00.htm" target="_blank">for 124 sacks in Philadelphia</a>. In 1987 and 1988, Reggie White took home back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year awards, after racking up 39 sacks over the course of two seasons.</p>
<p>White was the lynchpin of a Gang Green defense that also featured Clyde Simmons, Ron Pitts, and Jerome Brown on the defensive line. With this group controlling the line of scrimmage, Seth Joyner and Eric Allen were both free to make plays in space. Head coach Buddy Ryan favored an attacking defensive scheme, unleashing White to work against one-on-one blocking. Over eight seasons with the Eagles, though, Reggie White never advanced past the Divisional Playoff round.</p>

<h2>2. Chuck Bednarik</h2>
<p>Chuck Bednarik was the last great two-way player in the game of football. At linebacker, Concrete Charlie would flow toward the point of attack and punish the ball carrier. In 1961, Chuck Bednarik <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/1960-philadelphia-eagles-new-york-giants-chuck-bednarik-frank-gifford-032115" target="_blank">leveled Frank Gifford</a> on a swing pass out in space at Yankee Stadium. Chasing Gifford down from behind, Bednarik went high and pummeled the future Hall of Famer down to the ground with one arm. Upon contact, Gifford immediately fumbled the ball, before lying prone on the field, and sitting out the game of football through the entire next season. This vicious hit secured Chuck Bednarik’s second NFL title as a Philadelphia Eagle.</p>
<p>As a 60-minute man, Bednarik would remain on the field to control the line of scrimmage at center. In 1953, Chuck Bednarik even boomed 12 kicks for 483 yards, as a punter. He was also a World War II veteran.<br />

<p>[caption id="attachment_779863" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-779863 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/McNab-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="497" /> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>3. Donovan McNabb</h2>
<p>The most successful quarterback out of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/phi/career-passing.htm" target="_blank">a group of dual threats that also included Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick</a>, Donovan McNabb also threw for more yards (32,873 to 26,963) and touchdowns (216 to 175) than fan favorite Ron Jaworski. Much maligned, McNabb led Philadelphia to a .647 winning record as the starting quarterback. This run also included five trips to the NFC Championship Game (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008) and one Super Bowl appearance.</p>
<p>McNabb was at his best in Andy Reid’s West Coast offense, on three- and five-step drops, where he would work the seams, fire quick outs, set up screens, and hit receivers across the middle. Reid often called designed rollouts for McNabb, allowing the team quarterback to stretch the defense, before dropping a deep bomb over the top of the secondary. On broken plays, Donovan McNabb would take off to rack up chunks of yardage and first downs with his feet. As a scrambler, McNabb picked up 3,249 yards and 28 touchdowns on the ground in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>McNabb, however, will always remain a polarizing figure. In Philadelphia, he often took the bulk of the blame for failing to lead a series of stacked teams to Super Bowl victory, and legions of football fans remember a winded Donovan McNabb burning through clock and dry heaving late in a 24-21 Super Bowl XXXIX loss to the budding Patriot dynasty.</p>

<h2>4. Randall Cunningham</h2>
<p>As a raw athlete, Randall Cunningham was second only to Michael Vick in the history of Eagles signal callers. On any given Sunday, Cunningham <a href="http://blogs.nfl.com/2013/03/25/randallcunningham/" target="_blank">would put together a highlight reel</a> of spins, flips, jukes, high-stepping scrambles, and deep bombs. In 1990, Randall Cunningham ducked a Bruce Smith sack out of his own end zone and rolled left, before setting his feet and effortlessly firing the football 60 yards through the air to Fred Barnett. Moments later, Cunningham had completed a 95-yard pass play, in front of a stunned Buffalo crowd.</p>
<p>Randall Cunningham, of course, was far more than a sideshow at quarterback. In 1990, Cunningham <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CunnRa00.htm" target="_blank">completed 58% of his passes for 3,466 yards and 30 touchdowns</a> against only 13 interceptions. That season, Cunningham also picked up 942 yards and 5 touchdowns on the ground. As an Eagle, he torched defenses for 22,877 passing yards, 4,482 rushing yards, and 182 total touchdowns, over the course of 11 years. In a pinch, Randall Cunningham would also serve as an emergency punter, as he boomed 12 kicks for 620 yards (51.7-yard average) in Philadelphia.</p>

<h2>5. Brian Dawkins</h2>
<p>Brian Dawkins was arguably the greatest run-support safety of his generation. At a built 6-foot-0 and 210 pounds, B-Dawk would often slide down toward the line of scrimmage, to effectively operate as a fourth linebacker, out of coordinator Jim Johnson’s defensive scheme. In passing situations, Dawkins would control the deep middle, and level wide receivers and tight ends that drifted into his zone.</p>
<p>Because of this versatility, Jim Johnson was free to dial up an array of blitz packages to harass and confuse the competition. To mix things up, Dawkins himself would often anticipate the snap count, shoot the gap, and slam into the quarterback. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DawkBr00.htm" target="_blank">In all</a>, B-Dawk racked up 707 tackles, 34 interceptions, and 21 sacks, through 13 years in Philadelphia.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Raiders have a reputation. Here are five of the players who have done the most on the field to establish the house that Al Davis built.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_765720" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765720 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Raiders-Jonathan-Ferrey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /> Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images[/caption]

Just win, baby. No matter what happens to the franchise, the Oakland Raiders will always be inexorably linked to Al Davis, their late (and cantankerous) owner. After a series of well-documented spats, Davis moved the franchise from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982, before reversing course, and packing back up to Oakland in 1995.

On the field, the Raiders’ win-at-all-costs mentality came from the top down, as Davis emphasized mental toughness and taking big risks out in the vertical passing game. The Raiders were especially dominant through the 1970s and early ’80s, when they claimed 8 AFC West titles over the span of 15 years. At this apex, the Silver and Black went on to win three Super Bowls in 1976, 1980, and 1983. Many of the all-time great Raiders have direct links to these glory years. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Tim Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765747" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765747 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Tim-Brown-Jed-Jacobsohn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

Tim Brown may always be historically underrated, but that’s what happens when you’re forever juxtaposed against Jerry Rice. Back to that in a moment. In his prime, Brown was unstoppable. After winning the Heisman at Notre Dame, he emerged as one of the more dangerous receivers and return men in the game of football. As a threat to score from anywhere on the field, Brown was especially adept at getting open, and shaking tacklers in space. As a rookie, Brown led the NFL in all-purpose yards, with 2,317. In all, he hauled in 1,070 receptions for 14,734 yards and 99 touchdowns <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowTi00.htm" target="_blank">over 16 years for the Raiders</a>.

Back to the Rice-Brown comparison: Rice and Brown actually joined forces as Raiders from 2001 to 2003. On the back end of their careers, both receivers were capable of racking up 1,000 yards and multiple touchdowns throughout the regular season, as starters. In 2001, the pair lost to the “Tuck Rule” Divisional Playoff to New England Patriots, in a snowbound Foxboro. The following season, former coach Jon Gruden and the Buccaneers blew out this aging, but celebrated wide receiver duo in the Super Bowl XXXVII 48-21. <!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Jim Otto</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765770" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-765770 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Jim-Otto-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="1137" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

At center, <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=169" target="_blank">Jim Otto</a> lead the Raiders’ offensive line between 1960 and 1974. As a model for toughness, Otto never missed one game, over the span of his 15-year career. As a devastating blocker and master technician, Jim Otto made every AFL All-Star Game through its 10-year existence. After the AFL-NFL merger, Jim Otto also made three straight Pro Bowls.

In 1967, Jim Otto emerged as a leader of the most prolific offense in the AFL, at 33.4 points per game. In doing so, Otto cleared passing lanes up front for quarterback Daryle Lamonica to throw 30 touchdowns through the 14-game regular season. The Green Bay Dynasty, however, ultimately blew out the 13-1 Oakland Raiders 33-14, in Super Bowl II.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Gene Upshaw and Art Shell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765801" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-765801 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Gene-Upshaw-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="513" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

A package deal on the left side of the offensive line between 1968 and 1981, Upshaw and Shell actually teamed up with the aforementioned Jim Otto, between 1968 and 1974, up front. Behind Gene Upshaw and Art Shell, the Raiders graduated from something of an AFL curiosity, to League-wide dominance. The pair won two Super Bowls for the Silver and Black, in 1976 and 1980. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/U/UpshGe00.htm" target="_blank">Upshaw</a> and <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/ShelAr00.htm" target="_blank">Shell</a> also combined for 15 trips to the Pro Bowl.

In 1976, Art Shell was masterful in his Super Bowl XI performance against the Minnesota Vikings. In this game, Shell dominated Purple People Eater defensive end Jim Marshall at the line of scrimmage. Marshall was a non-factor in this blowout, as he failed to make one tackle during the game. At corner, Willie Brown put the final stamp on this game, after taking an interception run back to the house.

At left guard, Gene Upshaw was literally Art Shell’s right-hand man. Upshaw was at his best out in space, on toss sweep and counter plays. As a pulling guard, he would terrorize defenses, by taking out linebackers and diminutive defensive backs, for big plays on the ground. In the passing game, Upshaw was especially adept at blitz pick-up, and keeping quarterback Ken Stabler upright for launching deep bombs.

<h2>4. Marcus Allen</h2>

Marcus Allen, at one point in time, was the unquestioned toast of Los Angeles. After winning the Heisman Trophy during his tenure with USC in 1981, Allen literally went crosstown to slap on Raiders gear. As a rookie, Marcus Allen led the NFL in both rushing touchdowns (11) and yards from scrimmage (1098). In 1983, Allen topped 1,000 yards rushing and paced the 12-4 Raiders towards Super Bowl XVIII.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQfU9KaRsvk" target="_blank">Against the Redskins</a>, Marcus Allen took the handoff, and veered left on a sweep. The Redskins, however, had quickly collapsed upon Allen out on the edge. From there, Marcus Allen stopped on a dime, turned a pirouette, hit the hole up the middle, and high-stepped into the clear, for a classic 74-yard touchdown run. In this Super Bowl, Marcus Allen took home MVP honors after galloping for 191 yards and 2 touchdowns on only 20 carries.

<h2>5. Ken Stabler</h2>
[caption id="attachment_765829" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-765829 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Ken-Stabler-George-Rose-Getty-images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="507" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]

More than any other player Ken Stabler embodied the vertical passing attack out of Oakland. As a gunslinger, Stabler made the most of a receiving corps that included the likes of Fred Biletnikoff, Cliff Branch, and Dave Casper. In Biletnikoff and Casper, the Oakland quarterback had a wide receiver and tight end at his disposal both capable of running precise routes and coming down with the football in traffic. Utilizing Cliff Branch, Stabler worked with the speedster to consistently torch defenses for the big play.

In 1976, Ken Stabler and the Oakland Raiders <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StabKe00.htm" target="_blank">put everything together</a>. En route to winning the Super Bowl, Stabler completed 67% of his passes, for 2,737 yards and a league-leading 27 touchdowns. For the season, Cliff Branch racked up 1,111 yards upon 46 receptions, which broke down further into a game breaking 24 yards-per-catch. For this Super Bowl XI, the sure-handed Fred Biletnikoff claimed MVP honors, after making 4 catches for 79 yards. Ken Stabler, of course, was at the heart of it all.

		<description><![CDATA[Through eight weeks of the 2015 NFL season, here's a look at the five teams with the best chance to win Super Bowl 50.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_883754" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lombardi-Trophy-Frederick-M.-Brown-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-883754" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lombardi-Trophy-Frederick-M.-Brown-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Lombardi Trophy on display" width="757" height="661" /></a> Frederick M.

Don’t look now, but we’re already halfway through the 2015 <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> regular season. If you find that hard to believe, you’re not alone. This year is truly flying by.

Of course, just because we’ve experience eight weeks of hard-nosed football, that doesn’t mean there still aren’t plenty of games left to be played. As we enter the second half of the season, now’s the time when we’ll start to see what teams are really made of. In a way, the fun is only just beginning.

Still, enough games have been played that we have a pretty good sense of which clubs are legitimate contenders and which clubs are nothing more than pretenders. And we’re not the only ones keeping track. The good folks in Las Vegas are always watching, always analyzing, and always ready to make their predictions. And right now, eight weeks into the season, they feel the odds are firmly in the favor of a select few clubs.

Since we’re sure you’re dying to know which teams fall into this particular category, we’ve got you covered. Therefore, without further ado, here’s a look at the five NFL teams with the best chance to win <a href="http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/50" target="_blank">Super Bowl 50</a>.
<h2>5. Carolina Panthers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_808677" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cam-Newton_1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-808677 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cam-Newton_1.jpg" alt="Cam Newton celebrates a touchdown" width="757" height="535" /></a> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Odds: 12-1</h2>
The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/car/2015.htm" target="_blank">Carolina Panthers</a> may not win pretty, but they win. And that’s all that really matters. Following their <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400791690" target="_blank">29-26 overtime victory</a> against the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night, the Panthers are now 7-0 on the year and hold the best record in the NFC. With quarterback Cam Newton playing with undeniable swagger and linebacker <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/14938/luke-kuechly" target="_blank">Luke Kuechly</a> fronting a formidable defense, Carolina has the look of a legitimate contender. Who would’ve thought?

<h2>4. Arizona Cardinals</h2>
[caption id="attachment_883723" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Carson-Palmer-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-883723" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Carson-Palmer-Jason-Miller-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Carson Palmer celebrates a touchdown" width="757" height="505" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Odds: 10-1</h2>
Under head coach Bruce Arians, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/crd/2015.htm" target="_blank">Arizona Cardinals</a> continue to prove to the rest of the league that they are for real. After eight weeks, this group is 6-2 and sits atop the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/standings" target="_blank">NFC West standings</a>. The Cardinals are putting up 32.9 points a game (second of 32), while only allowing the opposition to score 19.1 points per contest (9th of 32). This team can win at home or on the road and isn’t afraid to mix it up in the trenches. We wouldn’t want to face the Cardinals in the postseason.

<h2>3. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_883731" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-883731" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images1.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning #18 and the Denver Broncos" width="757" height="588" /></a> Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Odds: 15-2</h2>
The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/2015.htm" target="_blank">Denver Broncos</a> have the most intimidating defense in the entire NFL. This group is giving up just 16.0 points per game (first of 32), leads the league in almost every statistical category, and is the main reason why the Broncos are 7-0. Unfortunately, the team’s offense hasn’t been nearly as effective. However, if the club’s Week 8 victory over the Green Bay Packers is an indication of things to come, perhaps <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/peytonmanning/2501863/profile" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a> and company may finally be heading in the right direction. If Denver starts dominating on both sides of the ball, it will be a tough team to beat.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_748623" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Aaron-Rodgers-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-748623" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Aaron-Rodgers-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers #12 calling the shots" width="757" height="479" /></a> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Odds: 11-2</h2>
Despite their recent <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=400791684" target="_blank">29-10 loss</a> to the Denver Broncos, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/2015.htm" target="_blank">Green Bay Packers</a> are still 6-1 on the year, and easily one of the best teams in the NFC. This group has dealt with its fair share of injuries in 2015, but with quarterback Aaron Rodgers under center, the Packers can never be counted out of a ball game. We fully expect Green Bay to recover from this latest setback. In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised if it made the team stronger in the end.

<h2>1. New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_883740" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gronkowski-and-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-883740" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Gronkowski-and-Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Rob Gronkowski and Tom Brady celebrate a touchdown" width="757" height="480" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Odds: 5-2</h2>
The <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nwe/2015.htm" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a> have been far and away the best team in 2015. With <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> playing like a quarterback possessed, the Pats have put up 35.6 points per game (first of 32) and are outscoring the opposition by 16.6 points a contest (first of 32). We’re not sure if this team has what it takes to go undefeated this season, but it is currently 7-0 and shows no signs of slowing down. At this moment in time, it’s hard to bet against the Patriots.

		<description><![CDATA[With his latest victory, Peyton Manning moves into a tie for the most wins by a starting quarterback in NFL history. Here's a look at the top five.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_882865" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-882865" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning throws against the Green Bay Packers" width="757" height="543" /></a> Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]

Entering Sunday night’s matchup with the Green Bay Packers, there were many doubts surrounding the state of the Denver Broncos. Although this group was undefeated and sported one of the more dominant defenses we’ve seen in the last few years, its lack of firepower on the offensive side of the ball was a major cause for concern. This was a big game. And everyone knew it.

If the Broncos were going to convince people that they had a chance of winning the Super Bowl this season, they needed to put together a complete game against Aaron Rodgers and the Packers. The only way this was going to happen was if Peyton Manning and the Denver offense found a groove. Luckily for them, for what seems like the first time this whole 2015 season, the O came to play.

Denver compiled <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=400791684" target="_blank">500 yards of total offense</a> — 340 of them coming in the air — and the Broncos <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=400791684" target="_blank">defeated the Packers 29-10</a> at home to move to 7-0 on the year. Of course, this more than just a statement game. It was also a reminder of how great a quarterback Peyton Manning is. For with this victory, this 186th of his career, Manning moved into a <a href="https://www.nashvillepost.com/blogs/postsports/2015/11/2/manning_moves_into_tie_at_top_of_quarterback_wins_list" target="_blank">tie for the No. 1 spot on the all-time wins list</a> for starting quarterbacks in <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> history. That’s a lot of regular-season Ws.

We’re sure you’re wondering which other quarterback sits at the top of this particular mountain, but where’s the fun in simply throwing out a name? We can do better than that. So with that in mind, in honor of No. 18’s push to be No. 1, here’s a look at the five winningest quarterbacks in NFL history.

<h2>5. Dan Marino</h2>
[caption id="attachment_773293" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Marino-Rhona-Wise-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-773293" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Marino-Rhona-Wise-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dan Marino goes back to pass" width="757" height="515" /></a> Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Wins: 147</h2>
Hall of Fame quarterback <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MariDa00.htm" target="_blank">Dan Marino</a> never won the big one. However, that never stopped him from collecting Ws during the regular season. In his illustrious 17-year career, the <a href="http://www.miamidolphins.com/" target="_blank">Miami Dolphins</a> great won 147 games, while only finding himself on the losing end 93 times. As it stands, Marino sits at No. 5 on the all-time list for wins by a starting quarterback in NFL history.

<h2>4. John Elway</h2>
[caption id="attachment_745590" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-745590" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John-Elway-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="John Elway scrambles for yards" width="757" height="565" /></a> Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Wins: 148</h2>
There was a brief period of time when folks wondered if <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/E/ElwaJo00.htm" target="_blank">John Elway</a> would end up on a different list with fellow Hall of Famer Dan Marino — that of great quarterbacks who never lifted the Lombardi Trophy. Fortunately for No. 7 — and the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos" target="_blank">Denver Broncos</a> faithful — he ended up winning on the biggest stage. Twice. On top of that, Elway even managed to one-up Marino during the regular season, compiling 148 victories for his career. Let’s just say it’s good to be John Elway.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_861763" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tom-Brady_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-861763 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tom-Brady_Maddie-Meyer_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tom Brady sets to pass against the Jaguars" width="757" height="505" /></a> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Wins: 167</h2>
Something tells us that by the time he’s finally ready to call it a career, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a> will be firmly planted at the top of this list. However, until that time comes, the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/teams/nwe/" target="_blank">New England Patriots</a> superstar quarterback will have to settle for being No. 3 with 167 regular-season victories. Of course, we can think of four reasons why everyone else should be jealous of No. 12. If you catch our drift?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Peyton Manning (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_832732" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Peyton-Manning_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-832732 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Peyton-Manning_Jeff-Gross_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning celebrates a victory" width="757" height="548" /></a> Jeff Gross/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Wins: 186</h2>
This may not be the best statistical year he’s ever had, but <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00.htm" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a> continues to own the regular season. As we said before, Sunday’s victory over the Green Bay Packers gives Eli’s older brother 186 wins for his career, <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/661211218531627009" target="_blank">tying him for No. 1</a> on the list of victories for a starting quarterback. Soon enough we’ll see whether or not Manning can help the Denver Broncos carry their regular-season success over into the playoffs.
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>1. Brett Favre (tie)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_837954" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Brett-Favre_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-837954 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Brett-Favre_Jonathan-Daniel_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Brett Favre throws against the Colts" width="757" height="497" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>Wins: 186</h2>
<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FavrBr00.htm" target="_blank">Brett Favre</a> can rest assured, for at least a week, knowing that he still shares a spot at the top of this particular quarterback list. It took 20 years and four different teams, but one of the NFL’s most notorious gunslingers piled up 186 career wins. And while it’s only a matter of time before he drops a spot to No. 2 on the wins list, at least Favre still owns the record for the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career.htm" target="_blank">most career passing yards</a> (71,838) in NFL history. For now anyways.

We're a year and a half out from Peyton Manning's failed attempt to take it all against the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl XLVIII in New Jersey, but the star quarterback has also had an individually standout season in 2014. Manning claimed back his record for the most touchdown passes in a regular season from Tom Brady in 2013, and also threw for a league record total 5,477 yards.

Joe Montana once said there’s no thrill like throwing a touchdown pass. Taking that to heart, here’s a list of 10 quarterbacks with the <a href="http://www.sportscity.com/nfl/records/nfl-single-season-td-passing-leaders/" target="_blank">most touchdown passes</a> in a season in the history of the NFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>9 (tie). Matthew Stafford (Detroit Lions)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505634" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Matthew-Stafford-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505634 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Matthew-Stafford-Tom-Pennington-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="489" /></a> Tom Pennington/Getty Images[/caption]

41 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2011

Stafford shone in 2011 and added the honor of being only the fourth quarterback in NFL history and third in the 2011 season to throw for 5,000 passing yards in a season. The other two were Tom Brady and Drew Brees. Stafford then became the only quarterback in NFL history to pass for over 1,500 yards and 14 touchdowns over a four-game span. He was named a Pro Bowl alternate for the NFC and also the 2011 Pro Football Weekly Comeback Player of the Year, AP Comeback Player of the Year, and NFL Alumni Quarterback of the Year.

41 Touchdown Passes
Season: 1999

Warner, part of the Rams’ “The Greatest Show on Turf” offense, had a standout season in 1999, arriving to limelight straight from anonymity. He threw for a total of 4,353 yards and his 41 touchdown passes came with a completion rate of 65.1 percent. He also became the only NFL quarterback in history to throw three touchdown passes in each of his first three starts. Taking the Rams to a Super Bowl win against the Tennessee Titans, Warner set a Super Bowl record of attempting 45 passes without a single interception. He was named the league Most Valuable Player as well as the Super Bowl MVP that year.

43 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2012

In Week 14 of the 2012 season, Brees threw for 354 yards, which gave him his seventh straight 4,000-yard passing season and beat Manning’s record of six straight seasons. His streak of consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass each ended at a whopping 54 in Week 13 against the Atlanta Falcons. In all, 2012 was Brees’s fifth straight season with at least 30 touchdown passes &amp; 4,000 yards passing. Brees was then selected to the 2013 Pro Bowl as an injury replacement for Robert Griffin III.

<h2>7. Dan Marino (Miami Dolphins)</h2>

44 Touchdown Passes
Season: 1986

Marino threw for 4,476 yards and scored 44 touchdown passes in 1986 on his way to becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to have three consecutive seasons of 30 or more touchdown passes.  He threw his 100th career touchdown pass in the middle of this season, too, one in which he led the league in yards and touchdown passes. He was also named 1986 first team All-Pro.

<h2>6. Aaron Rodgers (Green Bay Packers)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505640" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Aaron-Rodgers-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505640 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Aaron-Rodgers-Chris-Graythen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="542" /></a> Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

45 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2011

The Packers left the playoff party too early in 2011, but Rodgers had one of the best seasons by a quarterback ever. He passed for 4,643 yards, scored a total of 45 touchdowns, and his passer rating of 122.5 is still the highest for a single season in NFL history. He also topped the league’s touchdown-to-interception ratio, touchdowns  percentage, and yards per attempt. He was named the league’s Most Valuable Player award and finished second for the AP-Offensive Player of the Year award.

<h2>5. Drew Brees (New Orleans Saints)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505641" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Brees-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505641" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brees-Joe-Robbins-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

46 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2011

Brees broke Dan Marino’s 27 year-old record for most passing yards in one season in 2011 on the way to setting a new Saints franchise record for passing touchdowns in a season. Brees would also remember the season for Week 17 against the Carolina Panthers, when he set 6 NFL records. However, Brees and the Saints lost the NFC Divisional Round Playoff game to the San Francisco 49ers.

48 Touchdown Passes
Season: 1984

The year of Marino’s only Super Bowl appearance saw him breaking six NFL passing records, including those for touchdown passes. His record of 48 was alive for 20 years before Manning and then Brady surpassed him. He was also named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player, although the Dolphins lost the Super Bowl against San Francisco 49ers 38-16.

<h2>3. Peyton Manning (Indianapolis Colts)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505643" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Manning-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505643" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Manning-Justin-Edmonds-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

49 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2004

During the season, Manning threw for 4,557 yards and the 49 touchdown passes were a then record. He was also selected as the 2004 NFL Most Valuable Player and was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year. He also won the Best NFL Player at the ESPY Awards and the ESPY Award for Best Record-Breaking Performance. According to statistics site Football Outsiders, this was Manning’s best season ever by a quarterback, play-for-play.

<h2>2. Tom Brady (New England Patriots)</h2>
[caption id="attachment_505644" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/01/Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-505644" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Brady-Jim-Rogash-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="512" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

50 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2007

That this was a memorable season for Brady would be an understatement. When the quarterback, who led the Patriots to the first ever 16-0 regular season record in league history, made three touchdowns against Indianapolis, it was the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so and that broke Manning’s record of eight. He also finally broke Manning’s overall record of 49 touchdown passes, set in 2004, in the very last game of the season. He was named both the Most Valuable Player of the season and the Offensive Player of the Year.

55 Touchdown Passes
Season: 2013

Manning still has the Super Bowl to deal with, but records came thick and fast for the quarterback in 2013. In his very first opening game of the season -- against the Baltimore Ravens -- Manning became one of only six players in NFL history to throw seven touchdown passes in one game. He then broke the record for most touchdown passes in the first three games of a season -- throwing 12 -- against the Oakland Raiders. Then came the main statistic for our list. On December 22, playing against the Houston Texans, Manning regained his record for most touchdown passes in a season from Brady after getting to 51. He eventually finished the regular season with 55 touchdown passes and also threw for a league record 5,477 yards.]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Miami Dolphins may be in dire straits right now, but they boast some legends (and perhaps a great-to-be) in their quarterback history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can divide the franchise history of the Miami Dolphin franchise into three acts pretty easily. In the &#8217;70s, the Dolphins built a winning program upon a stingy defense, ball-control offense, and efficient quarterback play. In 1983, the Fins drafted Dan Marino, and Don Shula re-wrote his entire playbook to build a high octane, aerial attack around his golden arm. After Marino’s 1999 retirement, however, Miami struggled to find a franchise quarterback and a real identity for several years running before finally picking up Ryan Tannehill in the 2012 Draft. As a result, the three greatest Miami quarterbacks of all time do largely align themselves with the glory years of the franchise.</p>
<h2>3. Ryan Tannehill</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_867144" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-867144" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Ryan-Tannehill-Stephen-Pond-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Miami Dolphins/New York Jets during the game at Wembley Stadium on October 4, 2015 in London, England." width="757" height="537" /> Stephen Pond/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Selected with the eighth overall pick in the 2012, Ryan Tannehill was the result of a decade of quarterback futility: Before arriving at Tannehill, the Dolphins had pitched the likes of Jay Fiedler, Chad Henne, and even Chad Pennington, as the long-term solution at quarterback, after Dan Marino. Tannehill, in three short years, has already racked up 11,252 passing yards, and is the third most prolific passer in franchise history, after improving with every successive season.</p>
<p>Last year, Tannehill completed 66% of his passes, for 4,045 yards and 27 touchdowns, against only 12 interceptions. Tannehill is an exceptional athlete, after having actually starred as the leading receiver, through his freshman and sophomore years at Texas A&amp;M. As a professional, Tannehill has learned to stand tall in the pocket and go through his progressions, before firing a strike downfield. As a last resort, Tannehill will simply take off and run, for large chunks of yardage.</p>
<p>Like all young quarterbacks, however, Tannehill must eventually make the leap, and start winning primetime football games. For now, Tom Brady and his four Super Bowl titles stand in the way, out of the AFC East. Last offseason, the Dolphins did sign prized free agent prize Ndamukong Suh to a six-year, $114 million deal, in an effort to help Ryan Tannehill take the next step. So far, that doesn&#8217;t seem to be working out so well, as the Dolphins have fallen to 1-3 and fired their head coach.</p>

<h2>2. Bob Griese</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_867156" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-867156" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bob-Griese-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Bob Griese/Getty Images" width="500" height="768" /> Bob Griese/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Often times, Bob Griese has been unfairly dismissed as a mere game manager, who simply rode the no-name defense and a rugged ground game to championship glory. For his part, Griese did compile a 92-56-3 regular season record, as the Miami starter. In doing so, Griese was named to eight Pro Bowls, while also racking up 25,092 yards and 192 touchdowns, over the course of 14 seasons.</p>
<p>Bob Griese did help lead the Miami Dolphins to three straight Super Bowls, between 1971 and 1973, with the teams winning back-to-back titles in 1972 and 1973. Griese, through the glory years, would hand off regularly to a stacked backfield featuring Larry Csonka, Mercury Morris, and Jim Kiick. After establishing the run, Griese would then go play action, and pass over the top to a streaking Paul Warfield. Warfield, in hooking up with Griese, averaged more than 20 yards per catch.</p>
<p>In 1972, Griese had the Dolphins sitting at 5-0, before taking a sack from Deacon Jones and breaking his leg. From there, Earl Morrall took over and led the Dolphins into the AFC Playoffs. Griese reported back onto the field, at halftime of the AFC Championship Game, and ultimately sparked the undefeated Dolphins to victory in Super Bowl VII. Years later, Griese’s son Brian suited up for Miami in 2003, to complete the circle.</p>

<h2>1. Dan Marino</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_789879" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-789879 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dan-Marino_Dolphins.jpg" alt="MIAMI, :  Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino gets ready to throw a pass in first quarter action in Mimi's NFL season opener against the Indianapolis Colts 31 August at Pro Player Stadium in Miami, FL. Marino is starting his 15th year as Dolphins quarterback." width="757" height="515" /> Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>The Miami Dolphins took Dan Marino with the 27th overall pick in the famed 1983 Draft, after John Elway (1), Todd Blackledge (7), Jim Kelly (14), and Tony Eason (15), were already off the board. By Week 7, Marino was named the starter and came out with guns a blazing, completing 58% of his passes (for 2,210 yards and 20 touchdowns) as a rookie. From there, a confident Marino quickly began to build his case, as the greatest pure passer in the history of football.</p>
<p>In 1984, as a second-year player, Marino completed 64% of his passes, lighting up defenses for a then record 5,084 passing yards and 48 touchdowns. This offensive explosion took Miami to 14-2 and set the stage for a Super Bowl XIX showdown between Marino and Joe Montana. Montana and the 49ers, however, schooled the young quarterback, and won the Big Game 31-19. Joe Montana walked away with Super Bowl MVP honors, after going 24-for-35, for 331 yards and three touchdowns. Marino, however, never made it back to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Marino revolutionized the game of football, showcasing that no scheme exists to defend the perfect pass. With his quick release, Marino would often thread the needle into double and triple coverage, and made household names out of &#8220;Marks Brothers," Duper and Clayton. As an offensive machine, Marino led the league in passing through five separate seasons, en route to racking up 61,361 yards and 420 touchdowns for his career. In 1999, Marino retired at the age 38, after having owned every significant passing record in the history of the NFL.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The industry for NFL agents is ruled by a handful of super-agents. Here is a look at the three agents who represent the most players in the league.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_830802" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-830802 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Josh-Gordon-Drew-Rosenhaus_Scott-Cunningham_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scott Cunningham/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

The agents who represent players in the National Football League have one of the most wrongly glorified jobs in the country. Most people don’t truly understand the grind that is required of the individuals who make a decent living as an NFL agent, and on top of that, few people realize how cutthroat and competitive the industry can be. Cracking into the business is an extremely difficult battle in itself; having a lasting career in the industry is another story and is something very few people accomplish.

Movies like <em>Jerry Maguire</em> and <em>Draft Day</em> make being an agent seem like the dream job for anyone who loves the game of football. What football fan wouldn’t want to recruit and sign college football’s best players, then accompany them to the NFL Draft, and then finally collect massive commission checks after negotiating multi-million dollar contracts with NFL franchises?

In reality, NFL agents spend the vast majority of their waking hours – which for most of them is no less than 18 hours per day – on their phones either talking with players, checking in with teams, reading and writing emails, recruiting new clients, negotiating deals, or a wide variety of other tasks that the job requires. What’s even more eye opening about the agent world in the NFL is how top-heavy the industry is. <a title="An agent's life isn't all glamour" href="http://mmqb.si.com/2013/12/19/nfl-agents-recruit-draft-prospects" target="_blank">Heading into the 2014 season</a>, roughly 13 percent of the league’s certified agents represented half of the league’s players, and 25 percent of the league’s certified agents represented 78 percent of the players in the NFL. On the opposite end of the spectrum, 42 percent of the league’s certified agents had zero active clients playing in the league.

We could go on for a while about the difficulties of being an NFL agent, but we’ll save that for another day. In this article, we are going to introduce the three agents who currently represent the most active clients in the NFL. All three of them represent several big-name players, and chances are if you happen to be an avid sports fan, you’ve likely heard of at least one of them. Without further ado, here is a look at the three agents who represent the most players in the NFL.

<h2>3. Bus Cook – 51 clients</h2>
[caption id="attachment_812271" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-812271 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Calvin-Johnson_Leon-Halip-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Leon Halip/Getty Images" width="757" height="549" /> Leon Halip/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notable Clients:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Jadeveon Clowney, outside linebacker, Houston Texans</li>
	<li>Jay Cutler, quarterback, Chicago Bears</li>
	<li>Calvin Johnson, wide receiver, Detroit Lions</li>
	<li>Mike Wallace, wide receiver, Minnesota Vikings</li>
	<li>Cam Newton, quarterback, Carolina Panthers</li>
	<li>Jamie Collins, linebacker, New England Patriots</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Cook is the founder and president of Bus Cook Sports and has a client list that includes some of the best players in the NFL. He may be best known for representing future Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, and negotiating the league’s first $100 million contract on his behalf, but there is no denying that Cook is one of the best agents in the business. Three of his current clients – Jay Cutler, Cam Newton, and Calvin Johnson – currently are playing on $100 million contracts, and he has several more players who are closing in on massive paydays as well.

<h2>2.  Joel Segal – 57 clients</h2>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sr7imOpRd5g?rel=0" width="300" height="150"></iframe>
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notable Clients:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Justin Houston, outside linebacker, Kansas City Chiefs</li>
	<li>Khalil Mack, outside linebacker, Oakland Raiders</li>
	<li>DeSean Jackson, wide receiver, Washington Redskins</li>
	<li>Patrick Peterson, cornerback, Arizona Cardinals</li>
	<li>Terrell Suggs, outside linebacker, Baltimore Ravens</li>
	<li>Maurkice Pouncey, center, Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
	<li>Mike Pouncey, guard, Miami Dolphins</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Segal is one of the most powerful agents in the business. His client list is littered with Pro Bowlers, and over the course of his career, he has negotiated over $2 billion in player contracts. Segal has represented over 30 first round draft picks since 2001 including Oakland Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper this year, and was inducted into the George Washington University Sports Executives Hall of Fame in 2011, which can be seen in the above video clip.

<h2>1. Drew Rosenhaus – 96 clients</h2>
[caption id="attachment_830799" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Drew-Rosenhaus_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-830799 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Drew-Rosenhaus_Scott-Halleran_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Scott Halleran/Getty Images" width="757" height="538" /></a> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notable Clients:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Rob Gronkowski, tight end, New England Patriots</li>
	<li>Antonio Brown, wide receiver, Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
	<li>LeSean McCoy, running back, Buffalo Bills</li>
	<li>Frank Gore, running back, Indianapolis Colts</li>
	<li>Greg Hardy, defensive end, Dallas Cowboys</li>
	<li>Josh Gordon, wide receiver, Cleveland Browns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
He may be despised by his peers in the agent world, but there is no arguing that Rosenhaus is ridiculously good at his job. On top of being one of the best in the business when it comes to bringing in massive paydays for his clients, the 48-year-old Florida native is also one of the best recruiters out there. As the most recognizable name and face in the industry, it should come as no surprise that Rosenhaus has far more active clients than any other agent in the business. Part of that is due to his track record, which leads to veteran players seeking him out, and the other part is due to him being a marketing genius. In closing, we’ll leave you with this snippet of Rosenhaus, courtesy of ESPN, for your viewing pleasure.

Whether you love the game of football or completely hate the idea of watching oversized men pound on each other, there is simply no denying that the National Football League is the king of professional sports in the United States of America. If you care to argue that statement, you should first consider the fact that the <a title="Everything You Need to Know About the Pats, Tom Brady, and Deflategate " href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pats-tom-brady-and-deflategate.html/" target="_blank">announcement of the punishments</a> for a minor rules infraction in the NFL immediately became a bigger sports news story than the playoffs in the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association (which were going on at the same time).

The NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry. <a title="NFL most popular for 30th year in row" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10354114/harris-poll-nfl-most-popular-mlb-2nd" target="_blank">For 30-straight years</a>, it has been the most popular professional sports league in America – by a wide margin. At the same time, the NFL may be the most corrupt and hypocritical business entity in the country. If a Fortune 500 company or any other billion dollar American corporation operated in a similar manner to the NFL, they would likely be facing extreme scrutiny from the media and the general public, they would almost surely be forced to deal with angry protestors, and they quite possibly could be forced out of business. The NFL on the other hand can get away with practically anything. Furthermore, with their enormous amounts of popularity throughout the country, and even the world, that will not be changing anytime soon.

At this point, you may be wondering what prompted us to drop such alarmingly serious accusations against the NFL. After all, this is the league that we spend loads of time covering, and will continue to do so. This is also the same league that all of us at The Sports Cheat Sheet devote multiple hours to every Sunday during the fall. You could even say that we are a part of the problem, but you cannot refute that the facts we are about to present will prove that our claims are spot on.

[caption id="attachment_802495" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Roger-Goodell_NFL.jpg"><img class="wp-image-802495 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Roger-Goodell_NFL.jpg" alt="Andrew Burton/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /></a> Andrew Burton/Getty Images[/caption]

We’ll kick things off by discussing the league’s obnoxiously hypocritical stance on player safety. The NFL continues to <a title="NFL passes five player safety rules" href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/03/24/nfl-passes-five-player-safety-rules/" target="_blank">adopt new rules</a> on a yearly basis that are designed to improve player safety, and they continue to <a title="Roger Goodell focused on making football safer" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2013/06/18/roger-goodell-player-safety-nfl-icons-innovators/2436895/" target="_blank">publicly insist</a> that the safety of their players is among their highest priorities. Yet the NFL fails to consider that the concept of teams having to play two games in a matter of five days directly contradicts the idea that they give a damn about the safety of their No. 1 asset – the players who have helped build the NFL into the billion dollar enterprise it is today. Imagine being in two severe car crashes in five days. That is what the NFL is putting its players through by continuing to schedule Thursday Night Football games.

Our next topic will be the pink gear that we see throughout the NFL on gamedays and in stores during the month of October. It would be easy to assume that the NFL would have it in their hearts to donate 100-percent of their net profits to the fight against the terrible disease. Well, those assumptions would be wrong. <a title="A Shockingly Small Amount Of Money From Pink NFL Merchandise Sales Goes To Breast Cancer Research" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/small-amount-of-money-from-pink-nfl-merchandise-goes-to-breast-cancer-research-2013-10" target="_blank">According to data obtained by Darren Rovell of ESPN</a>, only 8.01-percent of the money consumers spend on pink NFL gear goes towards cancer research. The NFL takes 1.25-percent of all sales, and they take a much higher percentage when they are the direct retailer. Leave it to the NFL to make money off of a “philanthropic” cause.

Further evidence of hypocrisy and corruption can be found within the NFL’s rulebook and in their sponsorship practices. The use of Stick ‘Em – an adhesive designed to make catching the football easier – is now illegal and is punishable by a hefty fine. At the same time, the league allows players to wear gloves bearing the NFL shield that are actually stickier than Stick ‘Em. What’s disturbing about the whole situation is that the league is making a substantial sum of money by selling those same gloves in retail stores. Speaking of fines, how effective and fair can the league’s system for hitting players with fines be if it is completely arbitrary? It seems un-American to us. <a title="Richard Sherman's Hypocrisy Claims Are Spot On" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-richard-shermans-hypocrisy-claims-are-spot-on.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">With a little help from Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman</a>, we will now elaborate on just how money hungry the NFL is. As Sherman famously pointed out, the league is quick to suspend players for alcohol abuse or receiving a DUI, but their biggest sponsor is Budweiser. Additionally, the league also believes they should have the power to tell players which headphones they can wear. The NFL has an exclusive sponsorship agreement with Bose, and has gone on to fine multiple players for wearing Beats headphones during pregame warm-ups and at press conferences.

As we conclude this article, we also thought it was important to point out that the NFL is the same league that has enough money to <a title="Goodell's Pay: $105 Million in 5 Years" href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/12/news/companies/goodell-pay/" target="_blank">pay league Commissioner Roger Goodell $105 million</a> from 2008 through 2012, but continues to nickel-and-dime its former players out of the healthcare they need to maintain a reasonable quality of life. It now looks like the NFL didn’t really enjoy Goodell’s salary going public. They have <a title="NFL drops tax-exempt status to avoid 'distraction'" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/04/28/nfl-tax-exempt-status-relinquish-roger-goodell/26516185/" target="_blank">dropped their tax-exempt, non-profit status</a>, making Goodell’s salary unavailable to the public. The league claims they made the move to avoid “distractions,” but we think it had more to do with their desire to avoid full transparency. At the end of the day, the NFL may truly be the most corrupt and hypocritical entity in America. But let’s face it, as long as we all continue to pour our hard-earned dollars into consuming all things related to the NFL, the league will continue to get away with anything they want.

		<description><![CDATA[Here is a look at the five NFL games since 2002 that have ended in a tie.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_710606" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710606 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mike-Nugent.jpg" alt="John Grieshop/Getty Images" width="757" height="505" /> John Grieshop/Getty Images[/caption]

To the surprise of many, professional hockey and soccer aren’t the only sports games that can end in a tie or draw. Though very uncommon, ties are actually possible in NFL regular season game. In 2012, the NFL implemented a fundamental change to its overtime rules that has been <a title="NFL Overtime Rules" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2210620-nfls-overtime-rules-should-die-a-sudden-death" target="_blank">met with mixed reviews</a>. Replacing the sudden death format, the rule now states that if the team that wins the coin toss goes down and makes a field goal, their opponent also gets a possession, and if the team with first possession scores a touchdown, the game is over.

Last season, the Cincinnati Bengals and Carolina Panthers’ Week 6 game ended in a 37-37 tie, marking the fifth time since the year 2000 that a NFL regular season game had ended in a tie. This is a game where the new overtime rules came into play as both teams kicked field goals in overtime. Here is a look at the five NFL games since 2000 that have ended in a tie.<!--nextpage-->
<h2>Atlanta Falcons at Pittsburgh Steelers — November 10, 2002</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710602" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710602 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Michael-Vick-Falcons.jpg" alt="DAVID MAXWELL/Getty Images" width="757" height="698" /> DAVID MAXWELL/Getty Images[/caption]

This game ended in a 34-34 tie. Led by Michael Vick, the Falcons erased a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to force overtime. Falcons’ quarterback Michael Vick took advantage of the Steelers’ prevent defense after being shut down for the first three quarters of the game. For the Steelers, quarterback Tommy Maddox and wide receiver Plaxico Burress both had career days. On the final play in overtime, Burress hauled in a Hail Mary pass but landed on the Falcons’ one-yard line, just short of the end zone.

<h2>Philadelphia Eagles at Cincinnati Bengals — November 16, 2008</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710599" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710599 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Donovan-McNabb-640x423.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="757" height="500" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

This game ended in a 13-13 tie, but will forever be known for Eagles’ quarterback Donovan McNabb’s now <a title="Donovan McNabb Overtime" href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281116004" target="_blank">infamous post-game proclamation</a> that he didn’t know NFL games could end in a tie. This game was ugly from start to finish and, in seemingly fitting fashion, ended on a missed 47-yard field goal attempt by the Bengals.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>St. Louis Rams at San Francisco 49ers — November 11, 2012</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710595" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710595 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rams-at-49ers.jpg" alt="Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images" width="757" height="511" /> Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images[/caption]

This game ended in a 24-24 tie. In a wild overtime period, both teams missed field goal attempts, the Rams had an 80-yard touchdown pass called back for an illegal formation penalty on the first play of overtime, and the Rams also had a game-winning 53-yard field goal nullified because of a delay of game penalty. The Rams missed the 58-yard attempt after the penalty and the game ended in a tie.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers — November 24, 2013</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_710587" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710587 " src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vikings-packers.jpg" alt="Hannah Foslien/Getty Images" width="757" height="615" /> Hannah Foslien/Getty Images[/caption]

This game ended in a 26-26 tie. The Packers scored 16 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 23-23 and send it to overtime. This ended up being the first game in regular season game in NFL history where both teams successfully kicked a field goal in overtime.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2><strong>Carolina Panthers at Cincinnati Bengals — October 12, 2014</strong></h2>
[caption id="attachment_710570" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-710570" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mike-Nugent-miss.jpg" alt="Andy Lyons/Getty Images" width="756" height="1002" /> Andy Lyons/Getty Images[/caption]

This 37-37 tie was the highest scoring game that resulted in a tie in NFL history. It was a back-and-forth game throughout that was tied at 34-34 at the end of regulation. Both teams successfully drove down the field and converted field goals on their first possessions in overtime. The Bengals put together an impressive drive on their next possession that took them down to the Carolina 18-yard line setting up kicker Mike Nugent for a potential game-winning, walk-off 36-yard field goal. Needless to say, Nugent missed the chip-shot and the game ended in a 37-37 tie.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_869327" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Aaron-Rodgers-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-869327" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Aaron-Rodgers-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers calls a play for the Packers" width="757" height="505" /></a> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re among the best players in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>, you tend to get paid quite well for your services. And considering how physically demanding the sport of football is, you better believe you&#8217;re going to endure some punishment for that paycheck. Fortunately, there are other ways to put food on the table. Some that, luckily, don&#8217;t involve getting the crap kicked out of you on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>As members of the most popular league in the country, NFL superstars tend to find themselves extremely appealing to some of the biggest brands in the country. And it&#8217;s not surprising to learn that these companies will pay players loads of money to endorse their products. How much money are we talking about?</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/10/11/the-nfl-players-who-make-the-most-from-endorsements/" target="_blank">good folks at Forbes</a>, whose &#8220;earnings estimates include endorsements, appearances, memorabilia, book royalties, and licensing income from the NFL Players Association," we now know which players make the most money from their off-the-field ventures. And since we&#8217;re all about spreading the information, we keep you informed by looking at the five players in the NFL who make the most money from endorsements.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>5. J.J. Watt, defensive end, Houston Texans</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_705920" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456277962.jpg"><img class="wp-image-705920 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456277962.jpg" alt="J.J. Watt gets the fans excited" width="640" height="463" /></a> Scott Halleran/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-field earnings</span>: $7 million</p>
<p>With his speed, strength, and incredible work ethic, Houston Texans defensive end, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WattJ.00.htm" target="_blank">J.J. Watt</a>, has turned himself into hands down the best defensive player in the NFL. Throw in the fact that he&#8217;s also incredibly likable, and it should come as no surprise that he&#8217;s killing it off the field as well.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, Watt has earned himself <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feffh/j-j-watt/" target="_blank">$7 million in sponsorship money</a> &#8212; three times as much <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/10/11/the-nfl-players-who-make-the-most-from-endorsements/" target="_blank">as any other defensive player</a> in the National Football League &#8212; through his endorsement deals with companies such as Reebok, Gatorade, Verizon, Ford, NRG Energy, and Papa John&#8217;s. Clearly it pays to be J.J. Watt.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Aaron Rodgers, quarterback, Green Bay Packers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_869325" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Aaron-Rodgers-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-869325" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Aaron-Rodgers-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers throws against the Seahawks" width="757" height="505" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-field earnings</span>: $7.5 million</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re arguably the top quarterback in the NFL, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before sponsorship deals become part of the equation. Just ask <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers</a>.</p>
<p>Based on Forbes&#8217; numbers, the Green Bay Packers QB has made himself <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feffh/aaron-rodgers/" target="_blank">$7.5 million through endorsement deals</a> with brands such as Adidas, Ford, Prevea Health, and State Farm. With the way he&#8217;s currently playing, Rodgers could easily be looking at more success both on and off the field.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>3. Eli Manning, quarterback, New York Giants</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_710276" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Eli-Manning-NYG.jpg"><img class="wp-image-710276 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Eli-Manning-NYG.jpg" alt="Eli Manning prepares to throw against the Colts" width="640" height="427" /></a> Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-field earnings</span>: $8 million</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/elimanning/2505996/profile" target="_blank">Eli Manning</a> may not get the same love as his older brother, but thanks to his two Super Bowl wins and self-deprecating nature, he&#8217;s become a valuable spokesperson for some major companies.</p>
<p>Thanks to his deals with Nike, Toyota, Gatorade, DirecTV, and Dunkin&#8217; Donuts, Peyton&#8217;s little brother is pulling in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feffh/eli-manning/" target="_blank">$8 million in endorsement money</a>. Considering he&#8217;s also managed to withstand the pressure of playing under the bright lights of New York City, we&#8217;d say Eli is doing well for himself.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>2. Drew Brees, quarterback, New Orleans Saints</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_799362" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Drew-Brees_Saints.jpg"><img class="wp-image-799362 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Drew-Brees_Saints.jpg" alt="Drew Brees celebrates a touchdown" width="757" height="519" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-field earnings</span>: $11 million</p>
<p>From a team perspective, the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nor/2015.htm" target="_blank">1-4 New Orleans Saints</a> are struggling beyond belief. In terms of individual success &#8212; financially speaking, of course &#8212; quarterback <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BreeDr00.htm" target="_blank">Drew Brees</a> is crushing the majority of the competition.</p>
<p>As Forbes notes, thanks to his working relationships with companies like Nike, Procter &amp; Gamble, Verizon, PepsiCo, and Wrangler, the former Super Bowl MVP is banking <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BreeDr00.htm" target="_blank">$11 million from endorsements</a>. As the leader of a team that will likely miss out on the postseason this year, at least Brees can find comfort in knowing that his bank account will remain flushed with cash.</p>
<h2><!--nextpage--></h2>
<h2>1. Peyton Manning, quarterback, Denver Broncos</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_869329" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-869329" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Peyton-Manning-Dustin-Bradford-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning throws against the Vikings" width="757" height="504" /></a> Dustin Bradford/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Off-field earnings</span>: $12 million</p>
<p>Whether or not future Hall of Famer <a href="http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/roster/peyton-manning/5e49338e-cd44-4226-9451-f111c0eb767d/" target="_blank">Peyton Manning</a> decides to call it a career at the end of this season, it should have no bearing on his ability to bring in the benjamins. He&#8217;ll always have his endorsement money to fall back on.</p>
<p>Through his lucrative deals with companies such as Nike, Papa John&#8217;s, Nationwide, DirecTV, and Gatorade, the Denver Broncos quarterback is making <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45feffh/peyton-manning/" target="_blank">$12 million in endorsements</a>. As far as NFL superstars and sponsorship money are concerned, there is no one doing it better than No. 18.</p>

In today’s NFL, when a defensive player is mentioned as a potential MVP candidate, you know right away that the player in question is really, really good. When a defensive player finishes second and receives 26% of the MVP vote, you’re likely looking at a future Hall of Famer. In 2014, Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt accomplished that feat when he finished as the <a title="Aaron Rodgers Named NFL MVP" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12257541/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-named-nfl-mvp" target="_blank">runner-up in the league’s MVP race</a> to Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Watt <a title="2014 MVP Voting" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2349593-nfl-mvp-2014-15-winner-voting-results-and-twitter-reaction" target="_blank">received 13 out of the 50 possible votes</a>, which was the highest total for a defensive player since former New York Giants great Lawrence Taylor took home the award in 1986.

There is no questioning that Watt was the best overall football player in the NFL a year ago. In fact, the 6-foot-6, 290-pounder’s performance in 2014 may have also been the most dominant season by a defensive player in NFL history. Watt’s grade from <a title="Pro Football Focus" href="https://www.profootballfocus.com" target="_blank">Pro Football Focus</a> was 107.5. The player with the next highest grade in the league, regardless of position, was Khalil Mack at 55.3. Watt <a title="NFL Sack Statistics" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/defense/sort/sacks/year/2014/seasontype/2" target="_blank">finished second in the NFL</a> in sacks with 20.5, which is a stunning statistic considering he spent most of his time lining up as a 3-4 defensive end — a position that is not traditionally known for producing sacks. On top of that, he had 44 total quarterback hits, and 54 total quarterback hurries. For his efforts, he became the <a title="J.J. Watt Runs Away With NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award" href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000466459/article/jj-watt-wins-defensive-player-of-the-year-award" target="_blank">first player in NFL history to win the league’s Defensive Player of the Year award by a unanimous vote</a>.

Watt even dabbled with being a two-way player in 2014, serving as a tight end for the Texans in their goal line package. It should come as no surprise that he had a significant impact on the game from the offensive side of the ball as well as catching three touchdowns passes, which was as many as future Hall of Fame wide receiver Andre Johnson. The former Wisconsin Badger was the main reason why the Texans were able to go from being a 2-14 team in 2013 to a 9-7 team in 2014.

Before we continue, it’s important to note that Watt has been much more than a one-year wonder. In his short career so far, he has accumulated two Defensive Player of the Year awards, three All-Pro selections, three Pro Bowl selections, and has tallied 57 sacks, 12 forced fumbles, 11 fumble recoveries, and countless quarterback pressures and hurries.

The only other defensive players who have impacted the game of football the way Watt has are Taylor and Reggie White. Taylor was the best linebacker to ever play in the NFL, whereas White was arguably the best defensive lineman to ever play at football’s highest level. What separates Watt from both Taylor and White is that he has the ability to be an All-Pro caliber player at a minimum of three defensive positions – defensive end, defensive tackle, and outside linebacker, and it wouldn’t be the least bit surprising if Watt could be a dominant inside linebacker as well. Watt is the complete package as a defensive football player, with a lightning quick first step, unmatched power, violent hands, and an incredibly high motor. Of course, there is also this recently released video that reminded us that Watt also happens to possess freakishly explosive athleticism.

At only 25 years old, the sky is the limit for Watt. He has been so good up to this point that he can be mediocre, by his standards, for the rest of his career and still end up with a bronze bust in Canton, Ohio. Knowing <a title="J.J watt Wired Up" href="http://247sports.com/Bolt/Texans-Watt-shows-passion-personality-as-he-is-wired-for-sound-33539286" target="_blank">Watt’s personality</a> and <a title="J.J. Watt is More Focused Than Ever" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/pete-prisco/24642045/watch-texans-star-jj-watt-is-bigger-more-focused-than-ever" target="_blank">desire to be the best ever</a>, that is highly unlikely to happen. If he can win one more Defensive Player of the Year award, which looks incredibly likely, he will tie Taylor for the most in NFL history. If the Texans are ever able to improve offensively, they may win enough games for Watt to get over the hump and actually win the league’s Most Valuable Player award. At his current rate, Watt could eventually go on to break the NFL’s all-time career sacks record. Only time will tell how he will remembered in NFL history, but with several years still remaining in the prime of his career, there is a very good chance that J.J. Watt will go down as the greatest defensive player in NFL history.

		<description><![CDATA[The greatest offensive linemen of all ­time combined deft footwork, leverage, technique, and size to dominate in the trenches.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For casual fans, the typical offensive lineman is a faceless brute who is but one mere part of a wall of humanity that crashes together before collapsing onto the turf. Throughout the game, a team&#8217;s best offensive lineman may never even hear his name called without making a mistake for holding, illegal procedure, or unnecessary roughness. In terms of celebrity, an offensive lineman&#8217;s ceiling is literally limited to a number one overall draft pick at left tackle, or a gimmick tackle­-eligible touchdown play on the goal line.</p>
<p>Fans of old school, smash-mouth football, of course, admire the brute force and timely efficiency of a cohesive offensive line unit. The best offensive linemen love to run block where they can pin their man at the line of scrimmage, move on to the second level, and go on the attack to drive overmatched linebackers into the ground. In the passing game, a great offensive lineman keeps his mean streak as a bodyguard ­enforcer to protect his quarterback and lay down the law.</p>
<p>The greatest offensive linemen of all ­time combined deft footwork, leverage, technique, and size to dominate in the trenches. The greats, of course, were often defined by the ferocity of their pancake blocks, perfect pass protection, and intimidating walls for pulls and traps. In terms of awards and accolades, the greatest offensive linemen of all time were permanent fixtures on All­-Pro lists and Pro ­Bowl squads during their respective heydays.</p>

<h4>10. Gene Upshaw</h4>
<p>As a Hall ­of ­Famer and one­-time executive director of the NFL Players&#8217; Association, Gene Upshaw was one of the most respected gentlemen to ever put on a pair of shoulder pads. Following his 2008 death, all NFL clubs paid their respects, with a GU No. 63 patch on the stadium field (pictured).</p>
<p>As a Raider, Gene Upshaw played 15 seasons at guard between 1967 and 1981. Upshaw started 207 out of 217 career games and was named to seven Pro Bowls. Upshaw was also a two­-time Super Bowl champion­­ with rings in 1977 and 1981. Upshaw performed as a gladiator for the Silver and Black­ &#8212; complete with full body armor, elbow pads, and one fiberglass cast to deliver forearm shivers to the opposition.</p>

<h4>9. Orlando Pace</h4>
<p>As an Ohio State road grader, Orlando Pace introduced the game of football to the term &#8220;pancake.&#8221; At the point of attack, Pace often left a trail of destruction that was evidenced by defenders laying flat on their backs. As a professional, he went number one overall to the Rams in 1997. In St. Louis, Pace protected Kurt Warner&#8217;s blind side for &#8220;The Greatest Show on Turf,&#8221; which also featured Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce, and Torry Holt. Behind their offensive firepower, the Rams were to become a mini-dynasty, who won Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000.</p>
<p>At left tackle, Pace was named to seven Pro Bowls and is a member of the 2000s All-Decade team.</p>

Stanton/NFLPhotoLibrary" width="640" height="452" /> Robert B. Stanton/NFLPhotoLibrary[/caption]</p>
<h4>8. Art Shell</h4>
<p>At left tackle, Art Shell teemed up with Gene Upshaw to form a devastating left side of the line for the 1970s Raiders. At his playing size of 6&#8217;5&#8243; and 265 pounds, Shell could still drop his hips and use good leverage to seal the edge and clear space for running back Mark van Eeghen to bounce to the outside. In the passing game, Shell helped to form a pocket and clear passing lanes for Ken Stabler and Oakland&#8217;s vertical attack. During his 15-­year career, Art Shell was named to eight Pro Bowls and two First­-Team All­-Pro lists. Art Shell also won two Super Bowls with the Raiders, including a classic Super Bowl XI performance, where he dominated and shut down &#8220;Purple People Eater&#8221; and fellow Hall-of-Famer Jim Marshall at the line of scrimmage.</p>

<h4>7. Jonathan Ogden</h4>
<p>As a fourth overall pick, Jonathan Ogden was drafted as the franchise left tackle for the Baltimore Ravens in the 1996 draft. Dubbed a can&#8217;t-miss prospect out of UCLA, Ogden did not disappoint, as he went on to immediately start at left guard his rookie year. The next season, Ogden slid over to left tackle, where he appeared in 11 straight Pro Bowls until his 2007 retirement. At 6&#8217;9&#8243; and 340 pounds, Ogden helped pave the way for Baltimore&#8217;s bruising Jamal Lewis, who racked up 2,066 rushing yards in 2003. Ogden also helped bring one Super Bowl XXXV ring home back to Baltimore during his playing days.</p>

<h4>6. Randall McDaniel</h4>
<p>At left guard, the freakishly athletic Randall McDaniel controlled the line of scrimmage for the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers between 1988 and 2001. Whereas most offensive linemen have carried a doughboy appearance, belly fat, and a wide­load backside, Randall McDaniel roamed the front lines as a cut, physical specimen, who could fly around the line of scrimmage and get nasty. A fixture of the Pro Bowl, McDaniel made the trip to Hawaii for a record 12 straight years (1989-2000). McDaniel&#8217;s versatility was on full display in Minnesota, where he would protect the quarterback, kick out outside linebackers as a pulling guard, lead mass convoys in the screen game, and even line up at fullback in short­-yardage situations. During the 1998 season, McDaniel&#8217;s Minnesota Vikings put a then-record 556 points on the scoreboard. That year, McDaniel&#8217;s work in the trenches may have been as equally impressive as the on­field showmanship out of the likes of Randy Moss, Cris Carter, and Robert Smith.</p>

<h4>5. Mike Webster</h4>
<p>Mike Webster quarterbacked the offensive line from his center position throughout the Steelers&#8217; &#8217;70s dynasty and into the late 1980s. &#8220;Iron Mike&#8221; was the greatest center of all time, and the benchmark for dominant centers out of Pittsburgh. Following Webster, the procession of Steeler greats who snapped the football at the point of attack went on to include Ray Mansfield, Dermontti Dawson, and Jeff Hartings. In today&#8217;s game, the young Maurkice Pouncey has proved that he is ready and able to carry forward the tradition of dominant centers at Three Rivers.</p>
<p>Over the course of his 17­-year career, Mike Webster started 217 times out of the 245 games in which he appeared. In Pittsburgh, Webster was tenacious, as he made line calls to protect Terry Bradshaw and open up gaps for the likes of Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier at running back. It&#8217;s because of his work in the gritty Steel City that Webster was selected to nine Pro Bowls­­ (1978-1987).</p>

<h4>4. Forrest Gregg</h4>
<p>Vince Lombardi once described Forrest Gregg as the greatest player that he ever coached. Lombardi, of course, was to coach fellow Hall of Fame players Frank Gifford, Jim Taylor, Paul Hornung, Bart Starr, Jerry Kramer, and Ray Nitschke. As a Packer, Gregg brought back five championships to the Green Bay &#8220;Frozen Tundra.&#8221; In the twilight of his career, he won Super Bowl VI with the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
<p>As an Iron Man, Gregg played in a then-record 188 straight games between 1956 and 1971. During this period, Gregg made nine trips to the Pro Bowl and seven appearances on the First­-Team All­-Pro list. As a right tackle, Gregg will forever be immortalized for sealing the edge and creating alleyways on the Lombardi power sweep.</p>

<h4>3. Bruce Matthews</h4>
<p>Bruce Matthews was the most versatile offensive lineman of all time. Matthews, an Oilers/Titans franchise lifer, lined up at all five offensive line positions. Bruce Matthews was especially dominant at center and guard where he was a Pro Bowl mainstay between 1988 and 2001. An Iron Man at offensive line, Matthews is now second only to Brett Favre (298 career starts) atop the professional football longevity list, with 292 career starts. Over 19 years, Matthews has imposed his will on defenders to clear space for the likes of Earl Campbell, Warren Moon, Eddie George, and the late Steve McNair.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_710079" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-710079 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/82406088-e1412966835522.jpg" alt="Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="640" height="512" /> Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>2. John Hannah</h4>
<p>At guard, the 6&#8217;2&#8243;, 265-pound John Hannah was somewhat undersized. &#8220;The Hog,&#8221; however, made up for his lack of size with speed, agility, and fiery intensity. It&#8217;s because of his athleticism that Hannah was especially effective as a pulling guard, who could get out front to lead sweeps and counter block on the trap. With the New England Patriots, Hannah was part of a 1978 unit that bulldozed defenses for a record 3,165 yards on the ground.</p>
<p>John Hannah was selected to nine Pro Bowls between 1976 and 1985. Most impressively, he was named lead guard on the NFL&#8217;s 75th Anniversary All­-Time Team.</p>

<h4>1. Anthony Muñoz</h4>
<p>Anthony Muñoz was the greatest offensive lineman of all time. At left tackle, Muñoz was the total package of size, strength, athleticism, and technique. In the passing game, Muñoz routinely shut down the game&#8217;s best defensive ends and outside linebackers. In the running game, he could wall off his man for two counts, throw him onto the ground, and rumble downfield to wreak havoc on pesky linebackers and defensive backs. As a receiver, Muñoz also hauled in four touchdowns on tackle­-eligible plays during his 13-­year career as a Cincinnati Bengal.</p>
<p>Muñoz<strong> </strong>mastered, perfected, and dominated his position as well as any man that has ever played any sport. Anthony Muñoz: The gold standard franchise left tackle.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Of the 473 head coaches in NFL history, just over 50 have lasted for more than 10 seasons.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_507161" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/Rex-Ryan-Brett-Carlsen-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507161 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Rex-Ryan-Brett-Carlsen-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Brett Carlsen/Getty Images[/caption]

The job of an NFL head coach is fraught with anxiety and little, if any job security. You’re rewarded if the team does well, but you’re the first to fall if the team loses a step. There are few professions that have an entire calendar day devoted exclusively to the firing of one position, but the NFL’s Black Monday — the first Monday after the final week of the regular season — is so widely known and anticipated as the day the coach gets canned that the New York Jets made headlines in 2014 by leaking the fact <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2013-12-29/rex-ryan-will-remain-new-york-jets-head-coach-owner-woody-johnson-hot-seat-2014-week-17-win-miami-dolphins" target="_blank">that they weren’t going to fire head coach Rex Ryan</a> (of course, they rectified that decision a year later).

Of the 473 head coaches in NFL history, just over 50 have lasted for more than 10 seasons. John Madden didn’t do it. Vince Lombardi didn’t do it. Guy Chamberlain, the winningest coach of all time (78.4 percent winning percentage) only coached for 6 years. It’s a demanding, stressful gig that burns most coaches out very quickly, even if they’re leading teams to victory.

The ten longest lasting NFL head coaches don’t feature some of the expected names. Bill Bellichick’s not here. Neither is Mike Shanahan, Jeff Fischer, or Tom Coughlin. For those few coaches who can make the job work, they lock in for a long time. A really, really, long time.
<!--nextpage-->
<h2>10. [tie] Marty Schottenheimer, Jeff Fischer, Bill Belichick — 21 years</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XOXK0NIqg8E" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong>Seasons Active: </strong>1984 – 2006 (Schottenheimer), 1991-2015 (Belichick), 1994-2015 (Fischer)

Fun fact: Marty Schottenheimer has the most wins of any NFL coach to never make it to the Super Bowl. How many wins does he have? A staggering 200, even more impressive considering his loss total — a mere 126.  It's a shame he'll eventually get displaced by Belichick and Fischer, assuming those two make it to the 2016 season.

Drafted as a linebacker in 1965 in both the NFL and the AFL (for the Baltimore Colts and the Buffalo Bills, respectively), Schottenheimer took his first head coaching gig with the Cleveland Browns in 1984, promptly leading them to a .500 record. In fact, Coach Marty wouldn’t do any worse with the Browns, finishing 44-27 with the franchise.

The Coach then bailed for the greener pastures promised by the Kansas City Chiefs, whereupon Schottenheimer continued to win. In his first 14 years as a head coach, Marty only finished under .500 once; in 1998, going 7-9. He promptly retired for a season, coming back to coach the Washington Redskins in 2001 and, later, the San Diego Chargers.

<h2>9. Chuck Knox — 22 years</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5K5nzk0qhnw" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active:</strong> 1973 – 1994

“You know me, I’ve been winning Pro Football games for years.” That’s how Chuck Knox’s talk show promo starts off, and he’s not wrong. Of his 22 straight years of coaching and a career win loss of 186-147, Knox was winning, and he was doing it for years.

Starting off with the Los Angeles Rams (now based in St. Louis), Knox lasted there for five seasons, going 12-2, 10-4, 12-2, 10-3-1, and 10-4 before moving on to the Buffalo Bills where he labored under .500 for two seasons before righting the ship for an additional three. Then, as the coach of a winning Seattle Seahawks team in the ’80s and ’90s, Knox became the first NFL head coach to win division titles with three different teams.

Coming full circle, Knox would leave the Seahawks for the Los Angeles Rams, spending three largely forgettable seasons with the team that had starting his coaching journey. Even with those dismal seasons on the books, Coach Knox would finish his tenure with Los Angeles a winner, going 37-36 with the team and retiring the season before the franchise moved to St. Louis.

<h2>8. [tie] Dan Reeves, Chuck Noll, &amp; Steve Owen — 23 years</h2>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R-RMEPgCk6U" width="300" height="150"></iframe>

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active: </strong>1981 – 2003 (Reeves), ’69 – ’91 (Noll), &amp; ’31 – ’53 (Owen)

Dan Reeves holds the NFL record for most Super Bowls participated in, factoring together his playing years, assistant coaching years, and head coaching years — <a href="http://www.danreeves.co/biography/" target="_blank">per his biography</a>, that would be “five with the Dallas Cowboys, three with Denver, and one with Atlanta.” Starting his head coaching off with the Broncos in 1981, Reeves would helm the John Elway offense that went 0-3 in the Super Bowl during the ’80s before moving to the New York Giants and later the Atlanta Falcons with no breaks in between.

Chuck Noll, by contrast, spent his entire career with the Pittsburg Steelers, from 1969 to 1991. That is, as they say, a very long time. Noll, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame  in 1993, finished his career with 4 Super Bowl Wins — the most out of any head coach in the history of the NFL. His lifetime regular season record as a head coach was 193-148-1. The tie occured in 1974.

Steve Owen, like Noll, spent his entire career with one club, the New York Giants. Or, rather, Noll was like Owen, since Owen coached the club from ’31 – ’53 and predates Chuck Noll’s NFL career by 38 years. A two-time Super Bowl Champion, Coach Steve innovated the “A Formation,” which innovated football’s offense throughout the ’30s and the ’40s, although it has been largely abandoned today.

<h2>5. Paul Brown — 25 years</h2>
[caption id="attachment_507162" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/Browns-Helmet-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507162 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Browns-Helmet-Maddie-Meyer-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /></a> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active:</strong> 1946 – 1975

Back in the day, the Cleveland Browns were a good football team. Really. In the days of yore, the real yore, back in the post-WWII era when Paul Brown was the coach. In Brown’s first six seasons, Cleveland lost 7 games. Total.

Largely credited as the first coach to use game film to scout opposing teams, Brown was at the forefront of the NFL, crafting the modern football  face mask, as well as being the first coach to hire assistants. Under his watch, the Browns won four AAFC Championships (that’s the All-American Football Conference) and three NFL Championships. A lifetime record of 213-104-9 and a Hall of Fame residency speak to Brown’s expertise.

After taking a six year break from 1962, Brown joined up with the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968, although he was unable to replicate his earlier success with Cleveland, which is the first time anyone has ever written that sentence.

<h2>4. Tom Landry — 29 years</h2>
[caption id="attachment_507163" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/Tom-Landry-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507163 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tom-Landry-Stephen-Dunn-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="507" /></a> Stephen Dunn/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active:</strong> 1960 – 1988

What’s the big deal about Tom Landry? Well, aside from his dedication to the Dallas Cowboys (he spent his entire career, all 29 years, with the Dallas club from age 36 to age 64), he invented the 4-3 offense. That’s pretty big, considering that it’s one of the two most popular defenses in the NFL — the other being the 3-4.

Landry’s 29 years with Dallas is its own NFL record, the longest a team had kept a head coach (or vice versa), and the fact that his contributions to the franchise ran all the way back to it’s inception in 1960, made his abrupt dismissal by new owner Jerry Jones at the end of the ’88 season turn some fans off of the team. Here’s a 1976 short film depicting Landry’s time with the Cowboys. It’s kind of hilarious, and kind of awesome.

<h2>3. [tie] Curly Lambeau &amp; Don Shula — 33 years</h2>
[caption id="attachment_507164" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/Don-Shula-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507164 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Don-Shula-Doug-Collier-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="503" /></a> Doug Collier/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active: </strong>1921 – 1953 (Lambeau), ’63 – ’95 (Shula)

Curly Lambeau founded the Green Bay Packers. Don Shula is the most recognizable coach in Miami Dolphins history. From humid South Beach to the icy tundra of Wisconsin, it would be hard to find a pair of more divergent coaches. Shula coached through the tumultuous ’60s and the neon ’80s, while Lambeau oversaw his Packers through a pair of World Wars. Shula is the winningest coach of all time, and Lambeau is not. Don is Don Shula’s real first name. Curly is not — that would be Earl.

Lambeau founded the Green Bay Packers, then called the Indian Packers (Curly was working as a shipping clerk for the Indian Packing Company) in 1919, the team would join the NFL in 1921. Lambeau was one of only two players on this list to be the coach as well as a player, suiting up as a halfback for the first ten years of the team’s existence while also acting as the coach (and the owner.)

Shula, in addition to being the most successful coach in terms of bringing in the W’s, also holds a pair of disparate NFL records; he holds the record for scoring the least number of points in a Super Bowl game (3, in Super Bowl VI) one year before winning Super Bowl VII and completing the NFL’s only perfect season in the process.

<h2>1. George Halas — 40 years</h2>
[caption id="attachment_507165" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/04/Halas-Trophy-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-507165 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Halas-Trophy-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="562" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Seasons Active:</strong> 1920 – 1967

At the top of the mountain is George Halas, the man who coached for 40 years (also the man for whom that trophy above is named). Although he didn’t coach them all straight through, Halas was a professional head coach of a football team from the age of 25 to the age of 72. Guh.

Starting off with the Decatur Staleys — later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_NFL_Championship_controversy" target="_blank">the controversial Chicago Staleys</a>, and later still the Chicago Bears — in 1920, Halas coached, played, and owned the team for the first ten years, when he retired as a player and, temporarily, as a coach to focus on being an NFL owner in 1929. He would be back coaching by 1933, and after another short break from ’42-’46, Halas would coach all the way through until 1967 (minus a short break in ’55 – ’58.)

Here’s a great, short documentary on Halas and his contributions to the juggernaut that the NFL has become.

		<description><![CDATA[While it seems as if a lot of flags have been thrown so far this 2015 NFL season, here's a look at the 3 games that featured the most penalties in history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_858012" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tony-Romo-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-858012 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tony-Romo-Elsa-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Tony Romo talks to an official" width="757" height="572" /></a> Elsa/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>If it feels like we&#8217;re beating a dead horse by continuing to talk about Sunday&#8217;s disastrous game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys, good. That&#8217;s the point. We honestly don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible to emphasis how truly terrible this game was on the eyes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Cowboys fan, then you&#8217;ve probably spent the entire day trying to figure out how your team is going to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-can-the-cowboys-handle-losing-tony-romo-and-dez-bryant.html/" target="_blank">survive the next few weeks without Tony Romo and Dez Bryant</a>. If you&#8217;re a Philly fan, well, you&#8217;re probably just trying to figure out <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-is-the-season-already-over-for-the-philadelphia-eagles.html/" target="_blank">whether or not the Eagles will be able to survive</a> the rest of the 2015 season. At this point, your guess is as good as ours.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re one of those people who was forced to endure this terrible mess of a rivalry showdown, and you don&#8217;t have any skin in the game, then we feel equally bad for you. Because we checked the numbers and, yes, the contest really was that awful. Especially from a penalties standpoint.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=400791705" target="_blank">team stats collected by ESPN</a>, these two teams combined for 26 penalties. The Cowboys, alone, were called for 18 infractions, which in turn cost the team 142 yards. What&#8217;s more interesting, is that we thought there were even more penalties on the afternoon; that&#8217;s how often we saw yellow flags being thrown. And while this game happened to be the one that stood out for us, this wasn&#8217;t the only contest where it felt like a lot of penalties were being called.</p>
<p>Of course, after taking a look at the numbers, it turns out that none of these 2015 games have seen as many penalties called as some of those contests in the past. Therefore, in order to keep you informed, here&#8217;s a look at the three games with the most combined penalties in <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> history.</p>

<h2>3. October 4, 1998: San Francisco 49ers 21 at Buffalo Bills 26</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_684737" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51635195.jpg"><img class="wp-image-684737" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/51635195.jpg" alt="Steve Young throws the ball against the Colts" width="757" height="604" /></a> MONICA M. DAVEY/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total combined penalties</span>: 34</li>
</ul>
<p>When the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank">San Francisco 49ers</a> traveled to Buffalo on <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199810040buf.htm" target="_blank">October 4, 1998</a> to take on the Bills, no one could&#8217;ve predicted the numbers of flags that would be thrown on that particular day. The Bills, who would go on to win the game by a score of 26-21, were penalized 12 times for 106 yards, while the visiting Niners would be hit with 22 penalties, costing the club 178 yards.</p>
<p>Although the two teams would <a href="http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/team/penalties" target="_blank">combine for 34 penalties</a>, at least the Bills could say they didn&#8217;t commit any turnovers on the afternoon. The San Francisco 49ers, on the other hand, gave the ball away on four separate occasions. Not exactly the best way to win on the road.</p>

<h2>2. October 17, 1976: Seattle Seahawks 13 at Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_858003" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Allen-Steele-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-858003 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers-Allen-Steele-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Buccaneers defense makes a play" width="757" height="505" /></a> Allen Steele/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total combined penalties</span>: 35</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197610170tam.htm" target="_blank">October 17,1976</a>, the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers met in an affair of two teams that would combine to win just twice during the 1976 NFL season. Unfortunately for Bucs fans, neither of those victories belonged to the team in Tampa Bay, as they would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/sports/football/02jets.html?_r=0" target="_blank">finish the year with a 0-14 record</a>.</p>
<p>In the end, while Seattle may have defeated Tampa Bay on this particular occasion 13-10, as far as penalties go, both of these teams were major losers. Seattle committed 15 penalties that cost the club 120 yards, while Tampa Bay was penalized 20 times for a total of 190 penalty yards. These two franchises may wish to forget they <a href="http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/team/penalties" target="_blank">combined for 35 penaltie</a>s during this game, however, history will not be as forgiving.</p>

<h2>1. November 25, 1951: Chicago Bears 21 at Cleveland Browns 42</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_858005" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Browns-and-Bears-Jonathan-Daniel-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-858005 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Browns-and-Bears-Jonathan-Daniel-Allsport-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Cleveland Browns against the Chicago Bears during the preseason" width="757" height="495" /></a> Jonathan Daniel/Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total combined penalties</span>: 37</li>
</ul>
<p>When is a loss not a loss? That&#8217;s a trick question &#8212; it&#8217;s always a loss. However, on November 25, 1951, when the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/teams/chi/" target="_blank">Chicago Bears </a>played against the Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the road team managed to win one battle: the penalty battle.</p>
<p>While the Bears would suffer defeat by a <a href="http://http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/195111250cle.htm" target="_blank">score of 42-21</a>, their 16 penalties for 165 yards was nothing compared to the 21 penalties for 209 yards committed by their opponents. By their miscues combined, the Chicago Bears and Cleveland Browns would set an NFL record for the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/team/penalties" target="_blank">most total penalties in a single game with 37</a>.</p>
<p>We dare any two NFL teams today to top that mark. Seriously, get on that. We think it would be hilarious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_753764" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-753764" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SuperBowl-640x437.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="517" /> (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)[/caption]

&nbsp;

Super Bowl 50 is <a href="http://www.sfbaysuperbowl.com/50iscoming/#ALHomokBuTKHAK4E.97" target="_blank">still more than 140 days away</a>. We’ve still got the tail-end days of summer, Halloween, Thanksgiving, the wintertime holidays and lots and lots of snow across the country to encounter before the milestone game takes place.

Players, management and team executives of the National Football League still have 16 regular season games and up to three playoff contests to see who competes on the grandest stage. Plain and simple, every team is 0-0 right now and every team – even the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers – have a 1/32 shot at taking home the next Lombardi Trophy.

The Jaguars and Buccaneers will absolutely not be a part of this post though. We’re not here to say for sure who’s going to be victorious on the Levi’s Stadium gridiron on Feb. 7, 2016, but to lay out the top dogs going into the season. While the theoretical odds right now of any team winning it all stand at that less than three percent, we all know there’s <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-power-rankings-the-full-of-hope-edition.html/2/" target="_blank">a specific bunch</a> who have to like their chances better than others.

Here are the top five contenders to win Super Bowl 50, ranked from least likely to most likely.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Denver Broncos</h2>
[caption id="attachment_797317" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-797317" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Denver-Broncos-1-640x432.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="511" /> Doug Pensinger/Getty Images[/caption]

A few seasons ago when quarterback Peyton Manning joined forces with the Denver Broncos, the team was somewhat one-dimensional. Their offense was perhaps the most explosive in the league and the philosophy was simple – let the all-time leader in touchdowns thrown air it out to his talented receivers and run (or throw) the opponents out of the building each week.

Last season at the age of 38 – and after multiple neck surgeries – <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/1428/peyton-manning" target="_blank">Manning attempted 62 fewer passes</a> than in 2013. His numbers, while still great, were down across the board. He completed two percent fewer of his pass attempts, his number of passing yards were down by about 700, he threw “only" 39 touchdowns, hurled 15 interceptions and his passer rating was “only" 101.5. Manning is still better than most QBs in the league and still has the potential for another historic season or two.

But enough about this one player, because the Broncos are so much more than that. They now have a dominant running back in C.J. Anderson and a new head coach in Gary Kubiak. Most recently the head coach of the Houston Texans, Kubiak knows a thing or two about defense and he certainly has the <a href="http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/depth-chart.html" target="_blank">personnel for dominance on this roster</a>. Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware and Aqib Talib on the same defensive unit? The Broncos are Super Bowl 50 contenders with this balanced team.

<h2>4. Green Bay Packers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_777240" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-777240" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Green-Bay-Packers__-640x435.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="514" /> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

No Jordy Nelson? No problem for the Green Bay Packers in 2015.

The best (maybe second-best?) quarterback in the NFL, Aaron Rodgers, will still have <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/depth/_/name/gb" target="_blank">plenty of offensive weapons</a> at his disposal this season. Starting in the backfield, Eddie Lacy is projected to have a monster third season as one of the numerous NFL backs with a difficult-to-tackle, monster build. Even without Nelson, Rodgers has a stud receiver in Randall Cobb and a popular breakout candidate in Davante Adams on the outside. With guys like B.J. Raji, Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers making up a veteran defensive team, the Packers are also well-rounded. The relatively weak NFC North should be a boost to Green Bay’s chances at another top seed in the playoffs.

After a devastating loss in last season’s NFC Championship Game, plus with their buddy Nelson on the sidelines, the Packers will have TONS of incentive to make a run to the Super Bowl this year. Look for Mike McCarthy’s squad to be right there near the top of the conference come January.

<h2>3. New England Patriots</h2>
[caption id="attachment_753035" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-753035" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Belichick_Pats-640x427.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]

Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. No matter how controversial, disliked and notorious these two figures may be throughout the entire league, their success is impossible to ignore. With this duo in the fold – no matter how many more years it may be for – the New England Patriots will be a perennial Super Bowl contender.

Throw in the fact that they are just seven months removed from one of the most thrilling championship wins in football history, and a unprecedentedly tumultuous off-season is behind them, this group of northeastern athletes are going to be fired up for week one.

Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, LeGarrette Blount, Jerod Mayo and Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler? Come on, how can you not peg <a href="http://www.patriots.com/schedule-and-stats/depth-chart" target="_blank">these guys</a> to at least make the AFC Championship again? Add in the aforementioned Brady and Belichick and you may just have a repeat Super Bowl Champion in 2016.

<h2>2. Indianapolis Colts</h2>
[caption id="attachment_758109" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-758109" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Indianapolis-Colts-640x442.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="523" /> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]

Forget about last year’s dismantling at the hands of the Patriots. Forget about their role in Deflategate for a minute. The Indianapolis Colts, as it stands right now, should be considered the favorites in the American Football Conference.

First of all, let’s look at their <a href="http://www.colts.com/schedule/season-schedule.html" target="_blank">schedule</a> and their competition within the division. They get off to a ridiculously easy start in 2015 by facing the New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars at home, with a road match up against the Tennessee Titans sandwiched in between. The next couple of games (at Houston and vs. New England) will be tough, but the Colts also have the fortune of playing four of their contests against last year’s worst division in football, the NFC South. Crazier things have happened, but can we all just say now that the Titans and Jaguars will have to wait until at least 2016 to have a shot at winning this division? That leaves only the quarterback-starved Texans in their way. Yeah, the Colts should handily repeat as AFC South winners.

Then you have the rapidly ascending Andrew Luck (at the top of the quarterback field with Rodgers),<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/depth/_/name/ind" target="_blank"> throwing to Andre Johnson and T.Y. Hilton</a> with new acquisition Frank Gore taking the primary hand-offs. Good luck stopping the Colts in their pursuit of Super Bowl 50.

<h2>1. Seattle Seahawks</h2>
[caption id="attachment_749526" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-749526" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Seahawks-Offense-640x426.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="504" /> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

Just one more yard to pay dirt in February and we would have been looking at the Seattle Seahawks as favorites to win their third straight Super Bowl right now. After coming up three feet short from earning the Lombardi Trophy again, the Seahawks perhaps have the most motivation in the NFL to make their way back to the final game. They haven’t lost much in terms of personnel over the summer, but they did add one very large piece on offense.

Jimmy Graham comes in as the newest member of the team and represents the best receiving target that quarterback Russell Wilson has ever had in his young NFL career. Of course, media shy guy Marshawn Lynch is still there, giving the Seahawks a tremendously versatile offense. Then <a href="http://www.seahawks.com/team/depth-chart" target="_blank">there’s the defense</a>, which is still the best the league has to offer.

Spearheaded by media blabbermouth Richard Sherman – a now fully-healthy Richard Sherman – Seattle’s defense has gotten so much love the last couple of years that’s it’s almost getting old. Well, for all of the praise to finally stop, someone’s going to have to do something to stop their dominance. The Patriots did it in last year’s Super Bowl, but for right now, the Seahawks are the top contenders to win Super Bowl 50.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[While the New England Patriots are being — and will continue to be — lambasted as cheaters for their controversial playoff run to a win in Super Bowl XLIX, it is important to remember that their opponents, the Seattle Seahawks, weren't boasting the most squeaky-clean track record themselves.

The Seahawks happen to be one of the league leaders in player suspensions for performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) and substance abuse since 2010. Ironically, two of the suspensions for the Seahawks came from the same player, and that person now plays for the Patriots.

here’s a look at the top seven teams in terms of number of players suspended for PEDs and substance abuse in the past five years.
<h2>4. Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, St. Louis Rams, Tampa Bay Buccaneers – 5 suspensions each [tie]</h2>

		<description><![CDATA[Here's a look at the top 5 players in NFL history who began their professional careers by playing in the CFL. Will Duron Carter join the list?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_751958" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751958 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Duron-Carter.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="1136" /> Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images[/caption]

It doesn’t happen regularly, but every so often, a player who was forced to begin his professional football career north of the American border will go on to become a star in the National Football League. Canadian Football League all-star Duron Carter has a chance to be the next CFL-to-NFL success story. The 6-foot-5 wide receiver and son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Cris Carter is <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12238996/duron-carter-deal-indianapolis-colts" target="_blank">reportedly nearing a deal</a> to become a member of the Indianapolis Colts.

Several players, such as Chad “Ochocinco" Johnson, have opted to play in Canada at the <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/06/chad-johnson-cfl-montreal-alouettes" target="_blank">tail end</a> of their careers, and some guys, such as Doug Flutie, used the CFL as a developmental league to <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/06/24/cfl-doug-flutie-grey-cup-canadian-football-league/" target="_blank">get back to the NFL</a> after a short-lived stint at the highest level the game has to offer. Not very many players slip so far through the cracks that they don’t at least get an initial crack at an NFL career. Carter was forced to take the CFL route <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/04/23/duron-carter-nfl-draft/2107981/" target="_blank">due to academic issues</a> that limited him to only one season of Division I college football.

Here’s a look at the top five players in NFL history who began their professional careers by playing in the CFL.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5.  Joe Horn, wide receiver</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751953" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751953 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Joe-Horn.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="649" /> Chris Graythen/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career NFL stats</span>:
<ul>
	<li>603 receptions</li>
	<li>8,744 receiving yards</li>
	<li>58 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
Academic issues limited Horn to only two seasons of junior college football, and the four-time Pro Bowler was forced to take part-time jobs at a fast food restaurant and a furniture factory. He was able to catch on with the now-disbanded Memphis Mad Dogs of the CFL, where he caught 71 passes for 1,415 yards in his only season in the CFL.

After excelling for a season in the CFL, Horn was selected in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs and went on to post four 1,000-yard receiving seasons, as well as earning a spot in the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame.

<h2>4.  Jeff Garcia, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751954" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751954 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Jeff-Garcia.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="519" /> Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career NFL stats</span>:
<ul>
	<li>61.6% completion percentage</li>
	<li>25,537 passing yards</li>
	<li>161 touchdown passes</li>
	<li>83 interceptions</li>
	<li>87.5 quarterback rating</li>
	<li>2,140 rushing yards</li>
	<li>26 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>58 career wins</li>
</ul>
After going undrafted in 1994 and receiving very little NFL interest, Garcia took his talents north of the U.S. border and played five seasons in the CFL for the Calgary Stampeders. Garcia won multiple individual awards and a Grey Cup championship in his five CFL seasons, which led to him signing with the San Francisco 49ers to compete for the backup quarterback job. Following Steve Young’s retirement after the 1999 season, Garcia won the starting job in San Francisco, where he earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl. He went on to play 12 total seasons in the NFL — five in San Francisco, one in Cleveland, one in Detroit, two in Philadelphia, two in Tampa Bay, and one in Houston — and was selected to four Pro Bowl rosters. Without his stint in the CFL, none of it would have been possible.

<h2>3.  Cameron Wake, defensive end</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751955" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751955 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cameron-Wake.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="497" /> Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career NFL stats</span>:
<ul>
	<li>63 sacks</li>
	<li>12 forced fumbles</li>
	<li>12 passes deflected</li>
	<li>2 fumble recoveries</li>
	<li>248 total tackles</li>
</ul>
Wake took a long and winding road to reach NFL stardom. He went undrafted in 2005 after playing linebacker for Penn State, and despite a very brief offseason stint with the New York Giants, Wake went on to spend the 2005 and 2006 seasons out of football. In 2007, he latched on with the British Columbia Lions, where he made the position switch to defensive end. From there, his career took off. He won the CFL’s Defensive Player of the Year award in 2007 and 2008, which led to him signing with the Miami Dolphins in 2009. Since making the move to the NFL, Wake has been named All-Pro three times and been selected to four Pro Bowls.

<h2>2.  Joe Theismann, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751956" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-751956 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Joe-Theismann.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="1136" /> Scott Cunningham/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career NFL stats</span>:
<ul>
	<li>56.7% completion percentage</li>
	<li>25,206 passing yards</li>
	<li>160 touchdown passes</li>
	<li>138 interceptions</li>
	<li>77.4 quarterback rating</li>
	<li>1,815 rushing yards</li>
	<li>17 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>77 career wins</li>
	<li>Super Bowl XVII champion</li>
</ul>
After an excellent college career at Notre Dame, Theismann was selected in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. After a long series of negotiations failed to yield a contract agreement, Theismann chose to begin his professional career with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. He went on to play in the CFL until 1973, earning two CFL all-star nods along the way.

Theismann joined the Washington Redskins in 1974 and took over as the team’s starting quarterback for the 1978 season. He went on to win two NFL most valuable player awards, make one All-Pro team, make two Pro Bowl rosters, and most important, he led the Redskins to a Super Bowl title in 1982.

<h2>1.  Warren Moon, quarterback</h2>
[caption id="attachment_751957" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-751957 " style="display: none !important;" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Warren-Moon.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="973" /> Mike Coppola/Getty Images[/caption]

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career NFL stats</span>:
<ul>
	<li>58.4% completion percentage</li>
	<li>49,325 passing yards</li>
	<li>291 touchdown passes</li>
	<li>233 interceptions</li>
	<li>80.9 quarterback rating</li>
	<li>1,736 rushing yards</li>
	<li>22 rushing touchdowns</li>
	<li>102 career wins</li>
	<li>Member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame</li>
</ul>
Throughout Moon’s football career, coaches continuously tried to change his position. Many felt he would be better off playing tight end or possibly even running back, but Moon was committed to being a quarterback, and it was his refusal to change positions that led to him going undrafted in 1978.

Moon chose to sign with the Edmonton Eskimos and went on to become a star in the CFL. He won five Grey Cup titles with the Eskimos in six years, took home the CFL Most Outstanding Player award in 1983, and was inducted into the CFL Hall of Fame in 2001.

Moon decided to make the jump to the NFL in 1984 and chose to sign with the Houston Oilers. He went on to play 17 seasons in the NFL, and was selected to nine Pro Bowls and one All-Pro team. He also won one MVP award and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_727416" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-727416 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/John-Riggins-Staff-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="502" /> Staff/Getty Images[/caption]

Power football brings to mind images of mammoth offensive linemen, violent collisions at the point of attack, and gladiator running backs that carry the load for 3 yards and a cloud of dust. Although the scheme is not always highlight ­reel-worthy, old school football fans recognize that the power attack is essential for a winning program. Behind a workhorse back, dominant teams can move the chains, eat up clock, and psychologically beat the opposition into submission.

Power football isn’t about trickery, gadget plays, or quarterbacks. Power football is about an intense match­up of wills, getting physical, and going man­o a man­o to out-muscle the competition. In football — and in life — there is a certain machismo behind telling somebody you are going to do something, doing it, and knowing that you cannot be stopped. This is lunch pail, John Madden, Bo Schembechler, autumn leaves, meat and potatoes, smash mouth football.

Here are the 10 greatest power running backs of all time.

<h2>10. Christian Okoye</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702899" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702899 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/317988-e1411651034729.jpg" alt="Jonathan Daniel / Stringer / Getty Images" width="757" height="503" /> Jonathan Daniel / Stringer / Getty Images[/caption]

An unlikely football star, Christian Okoye’s first loves were soccer and track and field in his native Nigeria. While attending college at Azusa Pacific in California, Okoye was to claim several titles in the hammer throw, discus, and shot put. After failing to make the Nigerian Olympic track and field team, Okoye turned his sights to playing football at the college level. Ironically, Okoye initially described the game of football as “boring, with bodies crashing about.” Of course, the game quickly become more exciting as the 6-foot-1, 260-pound Okoye realized his ability to maul hapless defenders and literally stomp his cleats into their respective necks.

Drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1987, the Nigerian Nightmare’s NFL career seemed to come and go in a flash. In six seasons, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/O/OkoyCh00.htm" target="_blank">Okoye tallied 4,897 yards and 40 touchdowns on 1,246 carries</a>, and performed as the perfect fit for Kansas City Marty Ball. At his peak, Okoye led the NFL in rushing­­ with 1,480 yards during the 1989 season. As with many power runners, Okoye’s production collapsed after the age of 30, when knee injuries forced him into the role of short yardage back. Okoye retired from football at 31, after cementing his feared status as a power runner and <em>Tecmo Football</em> video game legend.

<h2>9. Mike Alstott</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702901" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702901 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/82886890-e1411651207690.jpg" alt="Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="757" height="530" /> Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

At fullback, Mike Alstott still possessed the nimble feet to cut back across the grain and just enough speed to kick it into that extra gear and outrun opposing linebackers. Alstott, of course, always finished off runs by dropping low and driving his garish shoulder pads into the chests of would-be tacklers. The last of a dying breed, Alstott evoked memories of Csonka and Riggins, who also starred as featured runners from the fullback position.

In 11 seasons, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AlstMi00.htm" target="_blank">Alstott rumbled for 5,088 yards and 58 touchdowns</a>. At fullback, Alstott also had the soft hands to catch passes in the flat and terrorize defensive backs that were forced to hold the edge and submarine this brute. As a Buccaneer, Alstott recorded six consecutive Pro Bowl appearances between 1997 and 2002, and took home the Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl XXXVII.

<h2>8. Larry Csonka</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702903" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702903 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51668295-e1411651287946.jpg" alt="RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images" width="757" height="562" /> RHONA WISE/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]

Larry Csonka’s power running and no­-name defense sparked the Miami Dolphins 1970’s Dynasty before Dan Marino, Isotoner Gloves, and the phrase “taking your game to South Beach” became associated with sports lore. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CsonLa00.htm" target="_blank">As a Dolphin</a>, Csonka compiled three consecutive 1,000­-yard seasons (14-game regular seasons) between 1971 and 1973. During these seasons, Csonka posted averages of 5.4, 5.2, and 4.6 yards per carry, which was remarkable for a 6-foot-3, 240-pound power back. In Super Bowls VII and VIII, Zonk was at his best, as he grinded out 112 and 145 yards, respectively. In back­-to-­back Super Bowl victories, Csonka ran wild ­­to shake tacklers, deliver forearm shivers, and accept MVP honors.

<h2>7. John Riggins</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702904" align="aligncenter" width="756"]<img class="wp-image-702904 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/255006-e1411651405636.jpg" alt="Allsport /Allsport/Getty Images" width="756" height="539" /> Allsport /Allsport/Getty Images[/caption]

John Riggins was the good ‘ol boy next door who just happened to slap on a helmet to play professional football on Sundays. In Washington, Riggo was known just as well for his playboy lifestyle as he was for his hard charging touchdown runs for six. Vintage Riggins took the call on 4th and inches in Super Bowl XVII, before running roughshod over an outmatched Miami Dolphin defensive back, and barreling into space for a 43-­yard touchdown romp.

Nicknamed The Diesel, Riggins trucked defenses for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiggJo00.htm" target="_blank">a grand total of 11,352 yards and 104 touchdowns on the ground</a> with the New York Jets and Washington Redskins. By 2014, Riggins’s 104 rushing touchdowns were still good for sixth of all time. Interestingly, The Diesel did not run out of gas with age. In 1983, Riggins put together his best individual season. That year, Riggo powered the Redskins behind his 1,347 rushing yards and NFL­-leading 24 touchdowns, at the age of 34.

<h2>6. Jim Taylor</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702947" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702947 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/75963319.jpg" alt="Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width="757" height="1010" /> Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images[/caption]

Taken together, Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung made up the thunder and lightning combination at Green Bay. Taylor and his running mate Hornung were directly responsible for Frozen Tundra lore, with Lombardi ordering up “a seal here and a seal there” to create alleyways on the Packers’ toss sweep. As a power runner, Taylor’s 1960s-era production was second only to the great Jim Brown. In 1962, Taylor racked up 1,474 rushing yards to lead the NFL. That season, Taylor starred as the only player to lead the League in rushing besides Jim Brown, during Brown’s career that spanned between 1957 and 1965. In all, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TaylJi00.htm" target="_blank">Taylor racked up 8,597 rushing yards, 93 total touchdowns</a>, three NFL championships, and one Super Bowl victory.

<h2>5. Bronko Nagurski</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702909" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702909 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1830031.jpg" alt="Hulton Archive / Getty Images" width="757" height="1069" /> Hulton Archive / Getty Images[/caption]

Bronko Nagurski was a beast. Standing 6-foot-2 and weighing 235 pounds, Nagurski went All-­Pro at fullback, offensive tackle, and linebacker. For modern era fans, Nagurski may have been comparable to Jake Long, Larry Allen, or Tony Boselli motioning into the backfield to take handoffs before steamrolling defenders wearing leather helmets. As a Chicago Bear, Nagurski <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NaguBr00.htm" target="_blank">cleared a path of destruction</a> for 2,778 rushing yards over the course of his nine­-year career. By today’s standards, Nagurski’s statistical output may appear minimal. For the 1930s, however, Nagurski was a permanent fixture atop top ­10 statistical lists for rushing yards, yards per carry, and touchdowns. Nagurski set the precedent for Csonka, Riggins, Motley, and every other big back that could carry the load.

<h2>4. Jerome Bettis</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702913" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702913 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/116613513.jpg" alt="Mike Ehrmann/NFLPhotoLibrary" width="757" height="485" /> Mike Ehrmann/NFLPhotoLibrary[/caption]

As a power runner, Jerome Bettis was blessed with the size of a nose tackle to go alongside the twinkle toes of Fred Astaire. A patient runner, Bettis combined his vision and pitter ­patter feet to dance behind the line of scrimmage, break tackles at the point of attack, and power his way deep into the opposing secondary. Once the No. 36 Bus broke loose, Bettis was an intimidating load for overmatched defensive backs to bring down. As a 250 ­pound Teddy Bear in shoulder pads, Bettis was at his best during cold weather games at Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers. In 1997, Bettis rang the bell for 375 carries and 1,665 yards of power running, which further endeared himself to blue­-collar Steeler Nation.

For a bruising back, the Bus was the model for longevity. In 13 seasons, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BettJe00.htm" target="_blank">Bettis rushed for 13,662 yards, 91 touchdowns, and one Super Bowl victory</a>. Bettis’s 13,662 rushing yards are still good for sixth place of all time.

<h2>3. Earl Campbell</h2>
[caption id="attachment_702916" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702916 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/77169626-e1411651947474.jpg" alt="University of Texas/Getty Images" width="757" height="907" /> University of Texas/Getty Images[/caption]

Earl Campbell was an unreal combination of size and speed. Campbell possessed sub 4.5/40­-yard dash speed­­ on a 5-foot-11, 240-­pound frame. With his tree trunk legs and low center of gravity, Campbell was built for power running and could only be taken down through gang tackling.<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CampEa00.htm" target="_blank"> Earl Campbell led the NFL in rushing his first three seasons­­ with totals of 1,450, 1,697, and 1,934 yards</a>. As a virtual wrecking ball with breakaway speed, Campbell was the every down back who could muscle out the tough yards on 3rd and short, while also electrifying crowds with his potential to take the football to the house on any possession.

In the late ’70s and early ’80s, for Oilers and Bum Phillips, Campbell was money in the bank as he tallied more than 300 carries for five out of the six full seasons he played in Houston. Unfortunately, the workload, pile­-ups, and punishment steadily took its toll on Campbell’s legs and his career. By age 29, Campbell’s production collapsed, and he rushed for only 469 yards in spot duty between New Orleans and Houston. At 30, Campbell’s football career was finished. Unfortunately, the game’s one­ time most feared runner now needs assistance to walk up a flight of stairs as he has enters the twilight of old age.

2. Marion Motley

[caption id="attachment_702973" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-702973 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/456037462-e1411654393959.jpg" alt="Maddie Meyer/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /> Maddie Meyer/Getty Images[/caption]

Wearing No. 76, Marion Motley put up unreal numbers for the Cleveland Browns of the 1940s and 1950s. His No. 76 jersey as a running back was unusual, but fitting. On the field, Motley ran with reckless abandon, as if he were a big kid playing football against peewee toddlers. An unstoppable force, Motley reeled off 4,720 yards on 828 carries for a career 5.7 yards per carry average. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MotlMa00.htm" target="_blank">Motley’s totals include two rushing titles and an absurd 8.2­-yard average during his rookie campaign</a>. Motley was often hailed as the Jackie Robinson of football for integrating the sport, before he hung up his cleats with four AAFC championships and one NFL title for the Cleveland Browns.

<h2>1. Jim Brown</h2>
[caption id="attachment_710118" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-710118 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jimbrown-e1412968730588.png" alt="" width="757" height="759" /> Hulton Archive/Getty Images[/caption]

By<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BrowJi00.htm" target="_blank"> any statistical measure</a>, Jim Brown rivals Jerry Rice as the greatest football player of all time. Brown dominated the NFL for eight rushing titles during his nine­-year career between 1957 and 1965. At 6-foot-2 and 230 pounds, Brown ran roughshod over the competition for a total of 12,312 yards and 106 touchdowns on the ground. At 29, Brown retired from the game of NFL football, after having owned every significant rushing record on the books.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_841179" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NFL-Los-Angeles_Donald-Miralle_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-841179 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NFL-Los-Angeles_Donald-Miralle_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Donald Miralle/Getty Images" width="757" height="490" /></a> Donald Miralle/Getty Images[/caption]

There is no questioning that the National Football League is going to have a franchise based in Los Angeles, California in the very near future. This much we know. L.A. is the <a title="Los Angeles Market Facts" href="http://www.tvb.org/markets_stations#!id=116&amp;type=market" target="_blank">second-largest media market</a> in the country, trailing only New York City, and the NFL has never been the type of entity to let an opportunity to increase its profits and brand awareness slip by the wayside. The only real question remaining about the NFL potentially having a franchise in Los Angeles is figuring out which franchise will ultimately move there.

The idea of expansion – with either one or two teams – has been <a title="NFL Expansion Doesn't Look Like an Option" href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/165100/nfl-expansion-doesnt-look-like-an-option" target="_blank">all but officially eliminated</a> from consideration due to oversaturation and diminished profit sharing concerns among the league’s current ownership groups. That leaves franchise relocation as the only realistic means by which the NFL can get the team they so desire in the City of Angels. The league is <a title="NFL May Not Charge Relocation Fees" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydimoro/2015/08/17/nfl-may-not-charge-relocation-fee-raiders-preparing-for-move/" target="_blank">reportedly prepared</a> to waive any relocation fees to get a deal done, and it’s no secret that there are really only <a title="Rams, Raiders, Chargers aim to remain focused with LA looming" href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/oakland-raiders-san-diego-chargers-st-louis-rams-proposed-los-angeles-move-081615" target="_blank">three franchises</a> in the running: the Oakland Raiders, the San Diego Chargers, and the St. Louis Rams. All three franchises are fervently seeking stadium upgrades, with the Rams being the only team that plays in a city that is <a title="$15 million in tax credits approved for St. Louis riverfront stadium" href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/million-in-tax-credits-approved-for-st-louis-riverfront-stadium/article_d4f8b7cd-2a31-51fb-9d02-92719d5ae4e0.html" target="_blank">genuinely willing to work with them</a> on a stadium project. With that being said, the Rams are more than ready to relocate to Southern California if the opportunity becomes available. On the other hand, the move to Los Angeles would be quick and easy for the Raiders and Chargers who both already reside in The Golden State.

With the news that the NFL held an impromptu owners meeting on Tuesday, rumors about an L.A.-based franchise have only grown stronger over the last 24 hours. In fact, the buzz has grown to be so strong that the oddsmakers in Las Vegas have now released odds for which team they think has the best chance to end up in Los Angeles. Here is a look at what they came up with.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3.  Oakland Raiders</h2>
[caption id="attachment_841174" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-841174 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Oakland-Raiders_Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width="757" height="495" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds:</span></strong>  +1200

The Raiders already have strong ties to Los Angeles, having been located in L.A. from 1982-1994, and have an extensive fanbase throughout the Southern California region. The franchise is in desperate need of a new stadium, as O.co Stadium is arguably the most run-down venue in the league. The Raiders have already come together with the San Diego Chargers to <a title="NFL: The 5 Most Ridiculous Features of LA’s Proposed Stadium " href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-the-5-most-ridiculous-features-of-las-proposed-stadium.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">propose a shared $1.78 billion stadium in Carson, California</a> that would give both teams the upgrade they are looking for. The key holdup with the Raiders is the notion that they truly belong in the Bay Area. That may not matter, though, as the allure of a fancy new stadium will likely trump any geographical ties in this situation.

<h2>2.  St. Louis Rams</h2>
[caption id="attachment_841166" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-841166 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/St.-Louis-Rams_Dilip-Vishwanat_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images" width="757" height="451" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds:</span></strong>  +115

Rams owner Stan Kroenke recently bought a plot of land in Inglewood, California that is ready for immediate development and is large enough to house an NFL stadium. Kroenke has also long been rumored to be interested in moving his franchise to the west coast, and the Rams already have a following in the area after being based in the Los Angeles region from 1946-1994. These facts have clearly not slipped past the oddsmakers in Vegas who seem to think a that there is astrong chance the Rams will return to L.A.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1.  San Diego Chargers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_841163" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-841163 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/San-Diego-Chargers_Kevork-Djansezian_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images" width="757" height="564" /> Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images[/caption]

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Odds:</span></strong>  -140

The Chargers are the favorites in Las Vegas to be the team that ends up in Los Angeles. The franchise and the city of San Diego are pretty far apart in their negotiations for a new stadium that would satisfy the team’s dire need for a new venue. As we previously mentioned, the Chargers have teamed with the Raiders on a proposal for a shared stadium in Carson, California, and both teams are willing to change divisions to get a deal done. On top of that, San Diego is just a two-hour drive Los Angeles. At this point, the burning question seems to be whether or not the Chargers will keep their name, logo, and colors when they are playing in Los Angeles.

		<description><![CDATA[The NFL is filled with plenty of talented individuals, some of them more popular than others. Based on jersey sales, here are the 5 players who stand out.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_764475" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manning_Peyton.jpg"><img class="wp-image-764475" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Manning_Peyton-640x427.jpg" alt="Peyton Manning throws in the AFC championship game" width="757" height="505" /></a> Justin Edmonds/Getty Images[/caption]

If you were trying to figure out who the most popular players in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">National Football League</a> were, what would be the easiest way to come to a conclusion? One way would be to survey a bunch of fans. But seriously, who has the time for that. There’s has to be a more objective way to get the answer. If you ask us, there is: Jersey sales.

In a league filled with a ridiculous amount of stars, some players just seem to resonate with fans more than others. Their superhuman skill on the field is enough to warrant cheers, support, and the purchase of expensive merchandise. There’s nothing like when professional sports and commerce come together to provide us with tangible data. And it just so happens, that we have some right here.

Based on the sales on <a href="http://www.nflshop.com/" target="_blank">NFLShop.com</a> — the league’s official site — we now know which NFL superstar had the highest jersey sales as of June 2015. And if it’s anything like it was <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-best-selling-player-jerseys-in-the-nba-today.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">for the NBA</a>, you can be fairly certain that these individuals fall into the category of the game’s most popular figures.

So without further ado, here’s a look at the five best-selling player jerseys in the NFL today.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>5. Aaron Rodgers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_817558" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aaron-Rodgers_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-817558 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Aaron-Rodgers_Kevin-C.-Cox_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers against the Falcons" width="757" height="500" /></a> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]

The only surprise about <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RodgAa00.htm" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers</a> being on this list is that he’s not higher than No. 5. Last year’s NFL MVP put himself in a league all by his lonesome, throwing for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RodgAa00.htm" target="_blank">4,381 yards, 38 touchdowns, and just 5 interceptions</a>. Since being drafted by the Green Bay Packers with the 24th overall pick in the 2005 draft, Rodgers has been to four Pro Bowls, is a two-time First-Team All-Pro, and a Super Bowl champion. He has an extremely accurate arm, is elusive in the pocket, and can throw pin-point passes on the run. If he continues to play at such a high level, there is a good chance he’ll go down as one of the greatest to ever play the position.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>4. Colin Kaepernick</h2>
[caption id="attachment_818548" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Colin-Kaepernick_Harry-How_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-818548 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Colin-Kaepernick_Harry-How_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Colin Kaepernick in the Divisional Playoff Game" width="757" height="504" /></a> Harry How/Getty Images[/caption]

<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KaepCo00.htm" target="_blank">Colin Kaepernick</a> is an absolute physical specimen. The 6-foot-4, 225-pound quarterback is built like an ox, runs like a track star, and has a rifle for an arm. Although many believe he’s regressed as a player over the last year, there’s no denying his potential is still off the charts. Kaepernicks is a new breed of quarterback that is both talented and electrifying. All he’s in need of is a bit of fine tuning. Fortunately, he had former Super Bowl winning quarterback <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000482987/article/warner-kaepernick-learning-to-harness-athleticism" target="_blank">Kurt Warner to turn to</a>.

“What I love first and foremost that’s Colin’s working hard," Warner said. “The hard thing is that you’re taking a guy who has relied so much on his athletic ability over the years and you’re trying to turn him into a guy who can be more comfortable in a quarterback position."

If Kaepernick can find the balance between being an athlete and being a quarterback, the rest of the NFL better watch out.

<h2>3. Tom Brady</h2>
[caption id="attachment_742694" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tom-Brady_Pats.jpg"><img class="wp-image-742694" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Tom-Brady_Pats-640x445.jpg" alt="Tom Brady throws against the Bears" width="757" height="526" /></a> Jim Rogash/Getty Images[/caption]

Not even a scandal can deflate <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady" target="_blank">Tom Brady</a>‘s popularity among NFL fans. He may have been knocked off his ‘golden boy’ pedestal and there’s a serious question as to <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/after-deflategate-can-anyone-ever-trust-tom-brady-again.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">whether or not he can be trusted</a>, but his accomplishments with the New England Patriots seem to supersede all the negativity. Brady has overcome being drafted in the sixth round — in 2000 — to make 10 Pro Bowls, be named First-Team All-Pro twice, win two MVP awards, and lift the Lombardi Trophy four times. Throw in the fact that he’s somewhat handsome and his wife is the biggest supermodel on the planet and it should come as no surprise that people buy his jersey. After all, it’s probably the closest they’ll ever get to actually <em>being </em>Tom Brady. And who doesn’t want that?

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Marcus Mariota</h2>
[caption id="attachment_809637" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marcus-Mariota-e1433522321420.jpg"><img class="wp-image-809637 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marcus-Mariota-e1433522321420.jpg" alt="Marcus Mariota speaks to the media at the NFL combine" width="757" height="505" /></a> Joe Robbins/Getty Images[/caption]

It wasn’t too long ago that Marcus Mariota’s jersey was flying off the shelves at an alarming rate, seemingly catapulting him into the position of the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/why-marcus-mariota-is-the-most-popular-player-in-the-nfl.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">NFL’s most popular player</a>. And following a loss in the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship game, we’re sure there’s nothing the Tennessee Titans rookie hates more than coming in second place.

As the 2015 NFL season looms just around the corner, the former Oregon standout and Heisman Trophy winner will have plenty of opportunities to regain his status as the player with the highest-selling jersey in the National Football League. Until then, however, we’ll just have to take comfort in knowing how “<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25209620/titans-wr-coach-calls-marcus-mariota-deadly-accurate-compares-him-to-stafford" target="_blank">deadly accurate</a>" everyone in the Titans organization claims him to be.

That’s should be good enough — for now.

Following one of the most mind-boggling catches ever on an NFL gridiron, last season’s Offensive Rookie of the Year Odell Beckham Jr.’s stock skyrocketed like nobody’s business. From the moment you watch him play, you realize how truly special the New York Giants wide receiver truly is. He has great burst, incredible leaping ability, and the most unbelievable hands. Seriously, the kid catches everything under the sun. If only it stopped there.

Entering his second season in the NFL, the pressure for Beckham to continue on the road to success has never been greater. He was <a href="http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/12881607/odell-beckham-jr-new-york-giants-selected-madden-nfl-16-cover" target="_blank">selected for the cover</a> of ‘Madden NFL 16,’ threw a softball 90 mph to earn himself a <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/could-odell-beckham-jr-actually-play-major-league-baseball.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">minor league baseball contract</a>, now finds himself with the highest-selling NFL jersey for the month of June. There’s always the possibility — considering how electric he was in 2014 — of Beckham falling into the dreaded sophomore slump. Yet, somehow, we have a hard time picturing that happening. Especially after seeing <a href="http://www.sportsgrid.com/nfl/odell-beckham-jr-practices-catching-footballs-laying-down/" target="_blank">this</a>.

You'd think that after witnessing such an epic Super Bowl between two <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">NFL</a> juggernauts -- the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks -- players around the league would feel the need to work even harder in order to achieve the ultimate goal of winning the Lombardi Trophy.

After all, success in the National Football League doesn't happen overnight. It takes passion, dedication, and total focus. That's the price of being a champion. That's how all players should approach their seasonal break from the NFL. Unfortunately, that's not how things went down for some individuals.

Instead of pushing themselves to be better for upcoming season, a select few players found themselves facing an even more brutal opponent: The law. Since the 2015 Super wrapped on February 1, there have been 23 arrests involving players in the National Football League at the time. Not exactly setting a shining example for a league that prides itself on protecting the shield.

While it should be noted that being arrested doesn't automatically mean a player is guilty of the crime, that doesn't change the fact that a lot of these players clearly put themselves in compromising positions -- something that doesn't go over well when your career choice constantly puts you in the public eye.

Who are these individuals that found themselves on the wrong side of Johnny Law? Don't worry, we've got you covered. With that, here's a look every NFL Player -- compiled from earliest to most recent -- who's been arrested since the 2015 Super Bowl.

Terrence Cody clearly forgot how much people love their animals in this country, as he was indicted for animal cruelty <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12268940/terrence-cody-formerly-baltimore-ravens-indicted-animal-abuse" target="_blank">involving his dog and an alligator</a>.

When you drive too closely to the vehicle in front of you, bad things happen. Just ask Ahmad Bradshaw.

<h2>18. Victor Hampton - February 28, 2015</h2>

If you're driving 100 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone, you shouldn't be surprised if you're pulled over for speeding. The only thing that could make matters worse, is being impaired in the process. Cue cornerback Victor Hampton (with college team, South Carolina Gamecocks), who thought it would be a good idea to do both on the last day of February. The <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000475798/article/victor-hampton-released-by-ravens-following-arrest" target="_blank">Ravens released Hampton following his arrest</a>.

Rodney Austin (far left, No. 74) messed up big time. On April 17, Austin was charged with four misdemeanor counts -- larceny and assault included -- resulting from a complaint brought forth by his ex-girlfriend with respect to an incident on April 5. The offensive lineman was accused on shoving a woman -- who was holding an infant -- to the ground and preventing her from calling 911 by taking her phone. The Detroit Lions sent him packing after the allegations surfaced. Austin has since been <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/06/09/rodney-austin-assault-detroit-lions/28748889/" target="_blank">found guilt of two counts of assault</a>.

McDonald was later hit with charges of  "<a href="http://deadspin.com/ray-mcdonald-charged-with-false-imprisonment-domestic-1716826060" target="_blank">felony false imprisonment, misdemeanor domestic violence, child endangerment, and violating a court order</a>."

The most recent arrest involving an NFL player just so happens to be the biggest. With the San Francisco 49ers already in the midst of a tumultuous offseason, things got immensely worse as linebacker Aldon Smith was arrested in Santa Clara on charges of hit and run, DUI, and vandalism. After giving the 25-year-old plenty of chances to get his act together, this final incident was the straw that broke the camel's back. The <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13394571/aldon-smith-released-san-francisco-49ers" target="_blank">Niners cut their troubled star</a>. Now it's anyone's guess where Smith goes from here. For all we know, his <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/is-aldon-smiths-nfl-career-over.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">NFL career may officially be over</a>. Such a shame.

		<description><![CDATA[San Francisco may be the NFL's premiere franchise when it comes to the glory of the pass, and these three players are a big reason why.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Francisco 49ers will forever be associated with prolific scoring and championship football. Bill Walsh and his West Coast offense revolutionized the game by replacing the run with the short pass. From there, playmakers were free to shake tackles and rack up chunks of yardage. In fact it was Jerry Rice who popularized the idea of “yards after the catch.”  The quarterback, of course, was always the heart and soul of the San Francisco attack. The top two 49’er signal callers of all time will be obvious to all football fans, as Joe Montana and Steve Young waged war against each other, in the most epic quarterback controversy in the history of the game. From there, names like Jeff Garcia, Alex Smith, Y.A. Tittle, and even Steve Bono, may come to mind.</p>
<h2>3. Colin Kaepernick</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_725820" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-725820" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/459128358-e1416253070138.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="539" /> Al Bello/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 27 Colin Kaepernick has already thrown for 8,415 yards and 50 touchdowns while also racking up 1,576 yards and ten touchdowns on the ground. In other words, over just two and one-half seasons as a full-time starter Kaep has quickly emerged as one of the better dual threat quarterbacks in the shotgun spread era &#8212; providing San Francisco with some chance to salvage even the most broken play for significant yardage.</p>
<p>First seeing game-time action relieving Alex Smith in 2012, Kaepernick was declared the full time starter by midseason and Smith, the first overall pick of the 2005 draft, was left to pack his bags for Kansas City. Later that year, Colin Kaepernick had put it all together, shredding the Green Bay Packers for 444 yards and four touchdowns in the Divisional Playoffs.</p>
<p>On paper, Kaepernick has already vaulted himself into the top-ten rankings for every significant passing statistic in franchise history. Most importantly, he has gone 25-14 as the starter, en route to appearing in two NFC Championship games and one Super Bowl. With so much accomplished so early, the QB will be able to focus on improving further as a pocket passer while his team rebuilds and defenses become more adept at quickly adjusting to the option-read attack.</p>

<h2>2. Steve Young</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_793776" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-793776 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Steve-Young-Timothy-A.-Clary-AFP-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="MIAMI, :  San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young points towards the sky 29 January 1995 after throwing his third touchdown pass against the San Diego Chargers during Super Bowl XXIX in Miami.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>As a young quarterback, Young was a raw athlete, who would often times simply take off and run instead of going through his reads and checking the football down to a secondary target. As an guiding light for Kaep, Young developed his pocket presence as a traditional quarterback over the course of his career, before retiring as one of the most accurate passers in the history of the game.</p>
<p>In 1987, Bill Walsh spent pennies on the dollar to get Young from Tampa Bay after the fiery lefty was prematurely declared an outright bust. Of course, Young didn&#8217;t really have the keys to the kingdom until 1993, but we&#8217;ll get to that in a second.<br />
In any event, Steve Young quickly emerged to lead the league in completion percentage, through five separate seasons. In 1994, Young put together one of the best statistical records of all time, completing 70% of his passes for 3,969 yards and 35 touchdowns. He capped off this epic season in Super Bowl XXIX, when he blitzed the San Diego Chargers for 325 yards and six touchdowns, en route to claiming MVP honors.</p>

<h2>1. Joe Montana</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_684346" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-684346" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Joe-Montana-George-Rose-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="TEMPE, AZ - JANUARY 28:  NFL legend quarterback Joe Montana who won four super bowls with the San Francisco 49ers poses for a photo on the field after participating in the coin toss prior to Super Bowl XXX between the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Sun Devil Stadium on January 28,1996 in Tempe, Arizona.  The Cowboys defeated the Steelers 27-17." width="757" height="505" /> George Rose/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Considered by many to be the greatest quarterback of all time, the legend of Joe Montana began in 1982, when he shook off the pressure, drifted towards the sideline, and threw up a prayer towards the back corner of the end zone. From there, Dwight Clark dragged across the back line, leapt into the air, and came down with a fingertip catch to take the NFC Championship. The Catch put an end to the 1970’s Cowboys run and  marked the beginning of a 49ers dynasty.</p>
<p>In all, Joe Montana made four trips to the Super Bowl through the 1980’s, winning all four. In Super Bowl XXIII, Joe Cool marched the 49ers 92 yards down the field, for the go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter. In doing so, Montana picked the Bengals apart with a series of short passes, before hitting John Taylor for six on a quick slant, with 34 seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>For the following postseason, Joe Montana completed 78 percent of his passes for 800 yards, eleven touchdowns, and zero interceptions, before throttling the Denver Broncos 55-10 in Super Bowl XXIV. Against the Broncos, Montana went over the top for 297 yards and five touchdowns to claim his third Super Bowl MVP award.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[While you may believe Rob Gronkowski is nothing more than a football player and a party animal, there's more to this superstar than meets the eye.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_816819" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Gronkowsi-Paul-Marotta-Getty-Images-e1435155948825.jpg"><img class="wp-image-816819 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Gronkowsi-Paul-Marotta-Getty-Images-e1435155948825.jpg" alt="Rob Gronkowski presents check at the Boston Children's Hospital" width="757" height="560" /></a> Paul Marotta/Getty Images[/caption]

On the surface, what do we know about New England Patriots star <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/robgronkowski/497240/profile" target="_blank">Rob G</a>r<a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/robgronkowski/497240/profile" target="_blank">onkowski</a>?

We know he’s a 6-foot-6 tight end with strength, speed, and ridiculously good hands. We know he went to the University of Arizona and will be be entering his sixth season in the NFL. We know he’s already been to three Pro Bowls, named <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GronRo00.htm" target="_blank">First-Team All-Pro twice</a>, and holds the mark for the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7341714/new-england-patriots-rob-gronkowski-sets-touchdown-mark-tight-ends" target="_blank">most touchdowns scored by a tight end in a single season</a> (17 in 2011). He’s a matchup nightmare for defenses and it’s nearly impossible to tackle him with just one guy. That’s what we know about Rob Gronkowski the football player. But there’s another side of him that’s not only entertaining, but even more impossible to ignore. We’re talking about the “Gronk."

What is the Gronk? It is the loud, goofy, fun-loving man-child side of the National Football League’s best tight end. It is the side that spikes the football with reckless abandonment after scoring a touchdown. It the side that shotguns beers in public, shakes its moneymaker on a duck boat during the Super Bowl parade, and makes this guy, arguably, the <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/rob-gronkowski-and-the-nfls-3-biggest-celebrities.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">biggest celebrity in the NFL</a>.

Whether it’s crushing it on the football field or living life to the fullest off of it, we can’t help but be enamored by Gronkowski. These are the sides of him we know. These are the sides we love. These are the sides we pay attention to. But what if we were to tell you there’s an entirely different side of this guy that you don’t know about. One that’s thoughtful, reliable, generous, and responsible. Would you believe it? Would you believe that if you take this latest side and combine it with the ones you’re already familiar with, that there’s reason to believe No. 87 is the ultimate role model? Probably not. But you should.

Rob Gronkowski is a beast on the gridiron and party animal off it. These are undeniable facts, but he’s also managed to be this guy without jeopardizing his future — from a financial standpoint, that is. How could we possibly know this? The power of the pen.

In his new book <em><a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/Its-Good-to-Be-Gronk/Rob-Gronk-Gronkowski/9781476754802" target="_blank">It’s Good to Be Gronk</a></em> — authored by himself and agent Jason Rosenhaus — the Patriots tight end admits that he’s yet to spend any of his NFL money.

“To this day, I still haven’t touched one dime of my signing bonus or NFL contract money. I live off my marketing money and haven’t blown it on any big-money expensive cars, expensive jewelry or tattoos and still wear my favorite pair of jeans from high school," writes Gronkowski in an excerpt of his book that was previewed Monday on <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2015/06/22/nfl-charleston-shooting-byron-maxwell-eagles/6/" target="_blank">The MMQB blog</a>.

At this point, that’s more than $10 million of <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-england-patriots/rob-gronkowski/" target="_blank">salary money</a> that Gronk has managed to save over the course of his brief, albeit, successful career so far. For a guy with his particular lifestyle, you’d think he’d be making it rain any chance he got. And he very well may be. But he’s enjoying life in a responsible manner.

“I don’t hurt anyone (except Gord with the occasional kick to the groin), I don’t do drugs, I don’t drive drunk, I don’t break the law… I’m a 23-year-old guy just looking to have a fun time.”

There’s no reason not to look up to a guy like that. And yet, what makes Gronkowski even more impressive is how self aware he is. He knows what he wants out of life. He knows the impact he can have on others. He’s willing to <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25207691/watch-rob-gronkowski-shaves-his-head-for-kids-with-cancer" target="_blank">get involved for a good cause</a>. But he also knows that none of this would ever been possible without dedication and hard work.

[caption id="attachment_816829" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Gronkowski-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-e1435156407661.jpg"><img class="wp-image-816829 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rob-Gronkowski-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-e1435156407661.jpg" alt="Rob Gronkowski celebrates with the Lombardi Trophy" width="757" height="544" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

In another section of his book, Gronkowski outlines an interaction he had with Patriots coach Bill Belichick. During this conversation, the hooded one questions Gronk’s lifestyle choices:

“While I was watching a training camp practice in between my own exercises, Coach Belichick was standing right next to me and said, ‘Rob, you are one of the hardest workers I’ve seen, and you’re always working hard when you’re here, but when you’re not here… I don’t know about your craziness off the field, the messing.’ I started laughing and told him, ‘The fun stuff makes me grind harder, coach.’ He shook his head as he walked off and said, ‘Whatever works for you.’”

If there was ever an individual who lived by the motto “work hard, play hard," it would be Rob Gronkowski. You can only get by so far on talent alone. This superstar recognizes that. He pushes himself to be better; to be great. But he is also well aware that life is about more than just work. It’s important to live life to the fullest and take advantage of the opportunities presented to you. It’s vital to learn and grow, to have experiences and make memories. But also, to do it in a fiscally responsible manner. That is the Gronk way. And it’s not a bad example to follow.

		<description><![CDATA[Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks came to terms on a major deal. How does this new contract compare to the other highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_831842" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Russell-Wilson-Norm-Hall-Getty-Images-e1438360189227.jpg"><img class="wp-image-831842 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Russell-Wilson-Norm-Hall-Getty-Images-e1438360189227.jpg" alt="Russell Wilson during warmups before a game against the Arizona Cardinals" width="757" height="504" /></a> Norm Hall/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>For what seemed like the longest time, the Seattle Seahawks and Pro Bowl quarterback <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WilsRu00.htm" target="_blank">Russell Wilson</a> had been at an impasse over his new contract. After leading the organization to two straight Super Bowl appearances &#8212; including one victory &#8212; the former Wisconsin Badger believed he deserved to be paid like one of the top quarterbacks in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" target="_blank">National Football League</a>.</p>
<p>The Seahawks, while more than aware of the young QB&#8217;s importance, have always believed that no individual player is more valuable than the team. With the two sides clearly not seeing eye to eye, we began to wonder if the team would actually <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-would-the-seahawks-actually-let-russell-wilson-walk.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">let their franchise quarterback walk</a>. We were fools to think that was even a possibility.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2015/07/31/russell-wilson-new-contract-seattle-seahawks" target="_blank">The MMQB&#8217;s Peter King</a>, Wilson and the Seahawks officially reached an agreement on a new four-year deal, worth <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/seattle-seahawks/russell-wilson/" target="_blank">$87.6 million</a>. The contract includes a signing bonus of $31 million and offers the quarterback $60 million in guaranteed money. If the 26-year-old was looking to be among the most valued players at his position in the league, this new contract should certainly do the trick.</p>
<p>Based on the figures of the deal, Wilson will now make an average of $21.9 million a year. You don&#8217;t usually see former third-round draft picks pulling in that kind of cash. However, when you&#8217;ve accomplished as much as Russell Wilson has in his first three years in the league, you tend to be an exception to the rule. So how does this new contract compare to the other top gunslingers in league history? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the five quarterbacks with the highest average annual salaries ever.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>5. Matt Ryan</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_778650" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Matt-Ryan__Atlanta-Falcons.jpg"><img class="wp-image-778650 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Matt-Ryan__Atlanta-Falcons.jpg" alt="Matt Ryan throws the ball against the Carolina Panthers" width="757" height="505" /></a> Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average Annual Salary</span>: $20.75 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Since being taken No. 3 overall in the 2003 draft, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/11237/matt-ryan" target="_blank">Matt Ryan</a> has been exactly who the Atlanta Falcons were hoping he&#8217;d be. He&#8217;s smart, consistent, and cool under pressure. And while the team hasn&#8217;t been to the playoffs since the 2012 season, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to place all the blame on Ryan&#8217;s shoulders. After all, Matty Ice is a three-time Pro Bowler and led the Falcons to the postseason four times in his first five seasons in the league. He&#8217;s a true franchise quarterback who rightfully earned the<a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/atlanta-falcons/matt-ryan/" target="_blank"> five-year, $103.75 million</a> deal the team gave him back in 2013. With that big-time contract, Ryan comes in with the fifth highest average annual salary &#8212; $20.75 million &#8212; out of all the quarterbacks in the NFL.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<h2>4. Cam Newton</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_808681" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cam-Newton.jpg"><img class="wp-image-808681 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cam-Newton.jpg" alt="Cam Newton goes back to pass" width="757" height="503" /></a> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average Annual Salary</span>: $20.76 million</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carolina Panthers believe former Heisman Trophy winner <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/N/NewtCa00.htm" target="_blank">Cam Newton</a> is the guy to lead this team to the promised land. And when you find a player like that &#8212; especially at the quarterback position &#8212; you pay him. You <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-cam-newtons-contract-extension.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">pay him BIG</a>. The deal Newton signed during this 2015 offseason was, by all account, set the market. At <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/carolina-panthers/cam-newton/" target="_blank">five years, $103.8 million</a>, the 6-foot-6 QB received $60 million dollars in guaranteed money and will make an average of $20.76 million a season. With a contract of this magnitude, the Panthers showed a lot of faith in the 26-year-old. Time will tell if they get a solid return on their investment.</p>

<h2>3. Ben Roethlisberger</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_720301" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ben_Roethlisberger.jpg"><img class="wp-image-720301" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ben_Roethlisberger.jpg" alt="Ben Roethlisberger throws against the Baltimore Ravens" width="757" height="543" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average Annual Salary</span>: $21.85 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger was originally set to make $11.6 million in 2015. That was before the two-time Super Bowl winner and the Pittsburgh Steelers came to terms on a much-deserved extension in March. Although the new deal has a <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/576738407256190978" target="_blank">base salary of $99 million over five years</a> &#8212; with a chance to escalate to $108 million &#8212; the contract actually provides Big Ben with <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers/ben-roethlisberger/" target="_blank">$87.4 million in new money</a>. For his excellent work on the gridiron, Roethlisberger will now see himself with an average annual salary of $21.85 million &#8212; the third highest all time among quarterbacks.</p>

<h2>2. Russell Wilson</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_831839" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Russell-Wilson-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-e1438359912330.jpg"><img class="wp-image-831839 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Russell-Wilson-Christian-Petersen-Getty-Images-e1438359912330.jpg" alt="Russell Wilson throws in the NFC Championship game" width="757" height="514" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>

<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average Annual Salary</span>: $21.9 million</li>
</ul>
<p>Russell Wilson was willing to play out the final year of his rookie contract. However, he believed things with the Seahawks <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/06/02/russell-wilson-on-his-contract-i-believe-it-will-work-out-hope-that-it-does/" target="_blank">would eventually work out</a>. He was right. This new four-year deal reaffirms just how much Seattle values the younger quarterback&#8217;s services. Aside from the $31 million signing bonus and $60 million in guaranteed money, Wilson will also be the second highest-paid quarterback &#8212; in terms of <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/contracts/" target="_blank">annual average salary</a> &#8212; in the NFL, at $21.9 million. If Wilson wants to thank the organization for its generosity, a third straight trip to the Super Bowl would be a good place to start.</p>

<h2>1. Aaron Rodgers</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_831844" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Aaron-Rodgers-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1438360555775.jpg"><img class="wp-image-831844 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Aaron-Rodgers-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images-e1438360555775.jpg" alt="Aaron Rodgers reacts in the NFC Championship game against the Seahawks" width="757" height="466" /></a> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Average Annual Salary</span>: $22 million</li>
</ul>
<p>When you&#8217;re the top quarterback in the National Football League, you deserve to be paid as such. This is exactly what the Green Bay Packers did for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RodgAa00.htm" target="_blank">Aaron Rodgers</a> in 2013, when the two sides came to terms on a new <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/green-bay-packers/aaron-rodgers/" target="_blank">five-year, $110 million deal</a>. According to Spotrac&#8217;s figures, this contract earned the two-time league MVP a $33.25 million signing bonus and provides him with $54 million in guaranteed money. The baddest man in all the land sits alone above the rest of the quarterbacks in the National Football League, making $22 million per season. In terms of overall talent and the money to back it up, there is no one better than Green Bay&#8217;s No. 12.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_674772" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-674772 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Aaron-Rodgers-Brandon-Weedon-Brian-Kersey-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="499" /> Brian Kersey/Getty Images[/caption]

In the NFL pay hierarchy, the quarterback reigns supreme. While cornerbacks have been <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/the-5-highest-paid-nfl-cornerbacks-richard-sherman-edition.html/?a=viewall" target="_blank">getting massive contracts recently</a>, and wide receivers are definitely not hurting for cash, the most lavish deals are reserved for the signal callers, the game managers, and the rocket armed. That said — and as any NFL fan with a passing interest in how the salaries are broken up in professional football knows — it’s not the size of the contract in total, but how much of the cash is guaranteed to go to the player. That’s why almost none of the NFL players who’ve signed contracts worth $100 million ever end up actually getting paid the full amount, and that’s why we’re looking at the QBs who are making the most in guaranteed money right now.

<h3><strong>7.  Jay Cutler, Chicago Bears, $54 million
</strong></h3>
The head of a team that went 8-8 last year, Jay Culter signed a seven year, $126.7 million dollar deal back in January, but only $54 million of it was guaranteed. The Bears, in an effort to clear cap space, later converted some of his yearly salary into a signing bonus <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-24/sports/chi-jay-cutler-contract-20140324_1_jay-cutler-cap-space-owners-meetings" target="_blank">for cap space reasons</a>.

<h3><strong>6. Aaron Rodgers, Green Bay Packers, $54 million</strong></h3>
Yes, Aaron Rodgers is making as much in guaranteed money as Jay Cutler, but we gave him the nod for six because his team made the playoffs. Sorry, Jay. Rodgers — who signed a five year extension worth $110 million with the Green Bay Packers in 2013 — is one of the best passers in NFL history, and is going to be paid millions until the ripe old age of 34. For the first three years of the deal, Rodgers will make more than $62 million dollars total (about $20.4 million a year.) Not bad.

<h3><strong>5. Tony Romo, Dallas Cowboys, $55 million</strong></h3>
Tony Romo may be the single most exciting quarterback in the NFL, especially if you’re not a Cowboys fan. There’s no better example of the Romocoaster than an early October game against the Denver Broncos, where Romo threw for over 500 yards and five touchdowns, only to throw a game-sealing interception late in the fourth-quarter. Romo’s deal, worth $108 million, is also exciting, even if “only” $55 million of it is guaranteed.

<h3><strong>4. Drew Brees, New Orleans Saints, $55 million</strong></h3>
All right, this one is a little confusing — because <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8163701/sources-drew-brees-new-orleans-saints-agree-record-contract" target="_blank">Brees has already made over $60 million dollars in guaranteed money</a>, despite the fact that his contract is guaranteed for $55 million. Basically, Brees’ deal included a ‘waiver window,’ good for three days after the waiver period begins (five days after the Super Bowl), which factored into a bonus for Brees, provided he was still the starting quarterback. Hairs are being split, but had Brees retired in 2013 — or something —  he wouldn’t have the $60 million.

<h3><strong>3. Tom Brady, New England Patriots, $57 million</strong></h3>
Does this look like the face of a man who agreed to restructure his contract (unlike Cutler, the Patriots didn’t have explicit language in Brady’s deal and had to ask him before doing it) only to watch his entire receiving core vanish into thin air, the Injured Reserve, and the penitentiary? Also worth noting: <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/writer/jason-la-canfora/21773794/details-about-tom-bradys-contract-with-the-new-england-patriots" target="_blank">this is the second lowest salaried year of the deal</a>, although a $30 million dollar signing bonus doesn’t mean a whole lot.

<h3><strong>2. Matt Ryan, Atlanta Falcons, $59 million</strong></h3>
Matt Ryan is the first of two quarterbacks in this list’s top four that had not won a Super Bowl before signing a lucrative contract with his club. The Falcons went all in on Ryan in June 2013, and by the look of last year’s campaign, they might not be so excited about the contract right about now — even if he played well.

<h3><strong>1. Colin Kaepernick, $61 million</strong></h3>
Back in June, the San Francisco 49ers signed Colin Kapernick to the largest guaranteed amount ever given to an NFL quarterback, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91007/kaepernicks-success-leads-to-big-payday" target="_blank">per </a><em><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/91007/kaepernicks-success-leads-to-big-payday" target="_blank">ESPN</a></em>. Astute link-followers will also note that article also has Brees listed at the $55 million mark we have, even if <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8163701/sources-drew-brees-new-orleans-saints-agree-record-contract" target="_blank">an earlier article</a> from the worldwide leader had listed it as $60 mil “for all practical purposes” two years before. Either way, Kaep is surely going to have to live up to his megadeal, <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/sports/nfl-kaepernick-signs-historic-deal-can-the-49ers-afford-it.html/?ref=SB" target="_blank">however team friendly</a> it may actually be.

		<description><![CDATA[NFL playoffs time is when teams get immortalized. Here's a look at the 5 winningest postseason teams in league history.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2015 NFL Playoffs' Wild-card weekend saw a new squad emerge as the winningest postseason team in NFL history. Said team went on to battle another one of the five winningest postseason franchises in league history in the divisional round, which saw the first squad go down in defeat but remain at the top of this list. While this team may currently have a firm grasp on this enviable title, there are several squads right on its heels that could potentially overtake it in the next couple of years.

Without further ado, here are the five winningest postseason teams in NFL history.
<h2>5. New England Patriots [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743234" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743234 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Patriots-Helmet.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Rob Carr/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason wins</span>: 25</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl appearances</span>: 8</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl wins</span>: 4</li>
</ul>
The Patriots are in the midst of one of the longest-running dynasties in league history. With Tom Brady at quarterback and Bill Belichick as the team’s head coach, the Patriots have made 12 postseason appearances in 14 years.

<h2>4. Green Bay Packers [tie]</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743232" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743232 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Packers-Helmet.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Frederick Breedon/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason wins</span>: 30</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl appearances</span>: 5</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl wins</span>: 4</li>
</ul>
The Packers always seem to look primed to make a serious run at winning their fifth Super Bowl title in franchise history. So far, success has eluded them since their 2011 victory over the Steelers.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>3.  San Francisco 49ers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743231" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743231 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/49ers-Helmet.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="506" /> Ezra Shaw/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason wins</span>: 31</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl appearances</span>: 6</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl wins</span>: 5</li>
</ul>
The 49ers won a lot of games — regular season and postseason — in the 1980s and 1990s. They are currently in the market for a new head coach but do still have an extremely talented roster that is fully capable of returning to the playoffs next season.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>2. Pittsburgh Steelers</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743230" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743230 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Pittsburgh-Steelers-Helmet.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="505" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason wins</span>: 33</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl appearances</span>: 8</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl wins</span>: 6</li>
</ul>
The Steelers lost to the Baltimore Ravens on wild-card weekend, and will have to wait until next season to try and add to their postseason win total. However, the Steelers do still hold the record for the most Super Bowl victories by a single franchise in NFL history.

<!--nextpage-->
<h2>1. Dallas Cowboys</h2>
[caption id="attachment_743229" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<img class="wp-image-743229 " src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cowboys-Helmet.jpg" alt="" width="757" height="495" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Postseason wins</span>: 34</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl appearances</span>: 8</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Bowl wins</span>: 5</li>
</ul>
With their victory over the Detroit Lions on wild-card weekend, the Cowboys jumped into sole possession of first place on the all-time postseason wins list. Then, faced with the unenviable task of taking on Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round of the playoffs, Tony Romo and company fell victim to some questionable refereeing and an overturned catch.

This Cowboys team has proven that it can play with any squad in the league, and if they are able to earn a berth in Super Bowl 50, they will also own the NFL record for most Super Bowl appearances by a single franchise in NFL history.

		<description><![CDATA[While there may not be a definitive pipeline from the NCAA to the NFL, there are certain schools that are better represented in the pros than others.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_703181" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-703181 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LSU-Wesley-Hitt-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Wesley Hitt/Getty Images[/caption]

It’s no secret that there are certain NCAA football teams that are more visible to NFL franchises than others, which is a nice way to say that Division One players in well-known (and, it should go without saying, well-funded) conferences and squads are getting a little more face time on the scouting network’s radar than someone laboring away in a corner far away from ESPN<i>'</i>s <em>GameDay</em> programming. There are some schools that are more NFL-friendly than others.

That’s not to suggest that there’s any specific school that’s a direct feeder into the pro leagues, of course. College football is so widespread, and NFL teams so eager to find talent anywhere and everywhere that they can, that if you can play, they will come. Taken together, each of these schools combined would comprise just four NFL rosters, and that’s not counting the eight additional programs that are in the same zip code, if not right on the cusp.

Finally, these are the schools with the most active players in NFL programs as of the 2014 season, and the information was obtained from <a href="http://www.besttickets.com/" target="_blank">Best Tickets'</a><em> </em>annual NFL Player census.

<h2>7. Miami</h2>
The Miami Hurricanes have been at the epicenter of a sordid controversy regarding improper player benefits for so long that no one blinks an eye at any allegations or news anymore, and it certainly hasn’t stopped the 32 alumni that are currently active in the NFL. Unsurprisingly, one of the two largest contingencies of former Hurricanes can be found on the Dolphins, who have four players from the school currently on their roster. The other? The team from Washington D.C.

<h2>6. Florida</h2>
Boasting one more Gator in the NFL than the Hurricanes and providing a reminder that the South Easternmost state in the Union absolutely cannot get enough of football, the University of Florida has 33 active alums dispersed within the ranks of the NFL. Although, unlike their contemporaries in the number seven slot, fans of the Chomp should know that only nine of those players are with teams based in their university’s state.

<!--nextpage-->

[caption id="attachment_703247" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-703247 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Florida-State-Ronald-Martinez-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="440" /> Ronald Martinez/Getty Images[/caption]
<h2>5. Florida State</h2>
Another spot on the list, another Floridian University. It should be noted here that FSU and the Gators actually have the same number of active NFL players repping their colors right now (33 apiece), so even with all of the interstate rivalry that could be elicited by the proximity the two schools have to each other in this list, they’re probably dead even.

<h2>4. Georgia</h2>
Georgia is our third entry in the four-way tie that is “college programs with 33 former players now in the NFL,” but no other place of higher learning on this list has the same kind of lock on the best receiver-quarterback combination as alums Matt Stafford and A.J. Green. The NFL should abolish the Pro Bowl and instead start co-hosting retro games with the NCAA. We could see Stafford, Green, and Knowshon Moreno suit up to fight some disease in throwback Bulldogs gear against other NFL players. Florida would have to take Tebow, though. It’s the only way ESPN would agree to air it.

<h2>3. LSU</h2>
Last but not least, the fourth 33-er on the list, the LSU Tigers are well represented among the NFL’s rosters with players on almost every team. But with no quarterbacks save Zach Mettenberger, we’re unsure as to how they would fair in our new Alumni Game, which we’re learning will now be sponsored by Taco Bell and Doritos. Reports are it’s to be called the Taco Bell Super Crunchy Bowl Sunday Series, where LSU would become the first team to field five NFL safeties on the field at once.

You’d watch that. Don’t try to act like you wouldn’t.

<h2>2. Alabama</h2>
Roll tide. With 36 active players making it into the NFL — remember: that doesn’t count free agents that brought their talents to well south of the Mason-Dixon — Alabama and fans can enjoy the fact that not only are they better than most other CFB teams day in and day out on paper, it's also their continued presence and representation among the highest caliber of professional football. Also, they have claim to the most addictive phrase ever. We’re not even particularly big fans of their program (mostly ’cause Nick Saban is scary), but we can’t help but repeating “roll tide, roll tide” for hours on end from time to time. Roll Tide.

<h2>1. USC</h2>
Admit it: you’re surprised. You were thinking that, given the last decade or so of SEC dominance, it would be another school from the most prestigious conference in the NCAA right now, as far as football’s concerned. But USC? Land of Carson Palmer, Reggie Bush, and Mark Sanchez? That was, almost assuredly, not the answer you thought you were going to get, but with 38 former players now in the pros, it’s the answer you’ve now got to deal with.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_731409&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-731409 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lee-Roy-Selmon-J.-Meric-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> J. Meric/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of the greatest NFL defensive linemen to ever play in the NFL is their total ability to swing the balance of any game at any time, even if the explanation was simple: They could not be corralled with one-­on-one blocking. Despite their brutish job description, these players made defensive football a thing of beauty by being equally adept at shutting down the running game and wreaking havoc on opposing quarterbacks. Sometimes operating on reputation alone, these all-­time greats could alter offensive game plans and put opposing coordinators out of work.</p>
<p>Before each play, a defensive lineman in a three­-point stance represents the calm before the storm. Immediately upon the snap of the football, the defender explodes upward, swivels his hips, and casts aside the opposing offensive linemen with a forearm shiver. From there, the greats all had a nose for the ball and the big play. With one fell karate-­chop swoop, a game-­changing lineman can force a fumble, recover the football, and head the other direction for six behind a convoy of like-minded goons. Here&#8217;s our list of the 10 greatest defensive linemen of all time. [Editor&#8217;s note: We&#8217;re waiting for J.J. Watt&#8217;s career to be over before we enshrine him next to his likely peers.]<!--nextpage--></p>

<h4>10. Randy White</h4>
<p>Randy White was a late bloomer. Beginning his career as a linebacker, White was somewhat of a lost prospect at first, until his third year, when he moved down to right defensive tackle, where he served as the focal point of a dominant 1970s defense in Big D. With a tireless work ethic and boundless durability, White only missed two games during his 14­-year career. In the early &#8217;80s, White was especially prolific, recording double-digit sacks between 1983 and 1985. At the apex of his career, White took home Super Bowl XII co­-MVP honors alongside his defensive linemate Harvey Martin. During that game, White and Martin controlled the line of scrimmage and helped the Dallas Cowboys beat the Denver Broncos for a 27­-10 shellacking in the Big Game.<!--nextpage--></p>

<h4>9. Bob Lilly</h4>
<p>Mr. Cowboy was the first draft pick for the Dallas Cowboys in 1961. Over the next 14 years, Lilly completely dominated the line of scrimmage at both defensive end and tackle. A fan favorite, Lilly built his game upon quickness and tenacity, scratching, clawing, and clubbing his way to an unabated run into the backfield. In addition to racking up tackles and sacks, Lilly was always on the hunt to force turnovers,<a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LillBo00.htm" target="_blank"> borne out by his four career touchdowns</a> and 109 return yards on 18 fumble recoveries. Lilly won two NFL Championships and one Super Bowl with his Dallas Cowboys.<!--nextpage--></p>

<h4>8. Gino Marchetti</h4>
<p>At defensive end, Gino Marchetti was simply relentless. As a member of the 1950s and &#8217;60s Baltimore Colts, Marchetti has been acknowledged by many NFL football historians as the best defensive lineman of his era. To stop the run, Marchetti would bowl over blockers at the point of attack, get low, and make tackles. On passing downs, Marchetti was a terror who ate up double and triple teams en route to taking his shot at quarterback. A famed tough guy, Marchetti broke his leg on a key stop during the Colts versus New York Giants NFL Championship ­­&#8211;<a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/indianapolis-colts/09000d5d8257cdbe/This-Day-in-Football-The-Greatest-Game-Ever-Played" target="_blank"> the Greatest Game Ever Played</a>. This bang-­bang play and tackle was to sideline Marchetti from appearing in a then­-record 11 consecutive Pro Bowl contests.</p>

<h4>7. Lee Roy Selmon</h4>
<p>Lee Roy Selmon&#8217;s career may be thought of as a historical casualty. Selmon was a force that combined speed and power to control the edge as a defensive end. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing in at 256 pounds, Ol&#8217; Lee Roy was the master of the bull rush, where he would power into a hapless tackle and drive his man into the backfield. From there, Selmon would toss aside this offensive brute as if he were a rag doll and set his sights upon the quarterback.</p>
<p>Between 1976 and 1984, Selmon toiled for the then-moribund Tampa Bay Buccaneers franchise before his career was cut short by injury. <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SelmLe00.htm" target="_blank">Within those nine short years</a>, Selmon was named to six Pro Bowls, claimed one 1979 Defensive Player of the Year trophy, and successfully polished off his Pro Football Hall of Fame résumé.<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_713956&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-713956 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/51152616-e1413832808316.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="617" /> David Maxwell/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>6. Carl Eller</h4>
<p>Minnesota Purple People Eater Carl Eller starred alongside Jim Marshall and fellow Hall of Famer Alan Page to form the greatest defensive line unit of all time. As a 6-foot-6, 247-pound left defensive end Eller was relatively svelte for doing battle in the trenches. He therefore relied upon quickness and technique to get around offensive tackles in space and make plays. Because of his speed, Eller was especially dangerous in passing situations. <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PlayerId=63" target="_blank">According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>, Eller recorded an unofficial 44 sacks in three seasons between 1975 and 1977. In 15 seasons, Carl Eller played in four Super Bowls and was named to six Pro Bowls.<!--nextpage--></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f1Ql_rvfnjc?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h4>5. Alan Page</h4>
<p>One of the famed Purple People Eaters, Alan Page became known for the aggression he brought to the defensive side of the football. Upon every snap, Page went into seek-and-destroy mode, looking only to obliterate the ball carrier. As a collegiate defensive end, he brought unparalleled quickness to the table and ultimately shifted inside as a defensive tackle at the professional level. Page&#8217;s natural quickness, of course, was further enhanced by his instinctual ability to read and react to play calls.</p>
<p>Over his 15­-year career, <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PageAl00.htm" target="_blank">Page put together a staggering list of statistics</a>, awards, and accolades at Minnesota and Chicago. As an iron man, Page performed in 238 straight games, made nine consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl, and anchored the Viking defense during four Super Bowls. As a force, he blocked 28 kicks, recovered 23 fumbles, and compiled 173 sacks; he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988.<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_713961&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-713961 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/84571825-e1413832976108.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /> Streeter Lecka/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>4. Bruce Smith</h4>
<p>Bruce Smith was a specimen. At 6-foot-4 and 262 pounds, he was all over the place for the Buffalo Bills. Although Smith&#8217;s primary position was listed as right defensive end, he was versatile enough to line up both over the center at tackle and over at right end in the 3­4 scheme. Smith shifted positions ­­so opposing offenses could not get a beat on him. At his regular right defensive end post, Smith was subject to triple teams, running back chip blocks, and outright dirty play to take him out of his game. Despite these tactics, No. 78 remained undeterred as a relentless power.<a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/history/leaders/_/stat/sacks" target="_blank"> Smith and his 200 sacks still top the all­-time list</a>.</p>
<p>Smith had all the moves. He would anticipate the snap count and jump the left tackle. Immediately, Smith would overpower some hapless sap with a bull rush before cutting inside with a spin move. After the spin, Smith would be on the move and turn on the jets to crush the quarterback from the blind side and force a fumble. And Ralph Willson Stadium began to rock: &#8220;Bruuuuuuuuce!&#8221;<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_713963&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-713963 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/91194791-e1413833078181.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="423" /> Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>3. Deacon Jones</h4>
<p>For modern fans, the late Deacon Jones emerged as an affable grandpa who also doubled as somewhat of a camera hog. The Deacon, however, was a fierce man in his prime. Jones literally invented the meaning of the term &#8220;sack,&#8221; and would certainly rank near the top of the heap if sacks were tabulated as official statistics for old timers. In the 1960s, Jones, the Secretary of Defense, joined forces with fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen alongside Lamar Lundy and Rosy Grier as the vaunted L.A. Rams&#8217; Fearsome Foursome. Behind the help of this group, the Deacon revolutionized defensive line play with his ability to swivel his hips and chase down the action from sideline ­to­ sideline.</p>
<p>As a sack artist and run stopper, Jones got loose at the line of scrimmage with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/sports/football/deacon-joness-effect-on-football-is-still-being-felt.html?_r=0" target="_blank">his patented head slap</a>. Illegal today, Jones would explode off the ball and bludgeon yet another faceless offensive lineman upside the head with an open palm. Leaving his opponent dazed and confused, the Deacon would then run amok deep within the offensive backfield. With the strength of this move, Jones totaled eight Pro Bowl appearances, two Defensive MVP awards, one title belt as the greatest sack artist of all time, and one bronzed Hall of Fame bust.<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_713965&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-713965 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/51560991-e1413833159252.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="411" /> David Maxwell/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>2. Joe Greene</h4>
<p>Mean Joe Greene starred as the anvil focal point that held down the Mighty Pittsburgh Steel Curtain. Equally tenacious against both the running and passing game, Greene dominated the league from Day 1. Greene&#8217;s technique had him wedge his body between the guard­-center A­ gap to disrupt blocking assignments and roam free, traumatizing offensive fronts. A primetime performer, Greene was at his best during a &#8217;70s dynasty run that included four Super Bowl trophies and countless playoff battles versus the hated Oakland Raiders. In Super Bowl IX versus the Minnesota Vikings, Greene was unblockable as he tallied one interception, one forced fumble, and one fumble recovery.</p>
<p>As a young buck, Mean Joe Greene despised losing and often let his temper get the best of him. Part of the Greene mystique has the man spitting in Dick Butkus&#8217;s face and challenging him to a fight right on the field. Beyond the legendary Butkus dust-­up, Greene was good for stomping on felled opponents, snapping the football to his own defense, and running into the pile to throw potshots after the whistle.</p>
<p>This guy was just plain mean. Like all giants, however, Mean Joe Greene did have a gentler side. In a classic advertisement, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8" target="_blank">Greene offered a young fan a Coke and a smile</a>.<!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_713967&#8243; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;640&#8243;]<img class="wp-image-713967 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/52027616-e1413833283901.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="507" /> Joe Piccociolo/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h4>1. Reggie White</h4>
<p>The late Reggie White was an unstoppable force. Known as the Minister of Defense, White mastered the hump move, where he would shrug his shoulders, deliver a forearm shiver to an overmatched right tackle, and then cut back to the inside. After the hump, White tracked a straight-­line path into the backfield, where he would blast the quarterback into next week.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, White teamed up with fellow big uglies Clyde Simmons, Ron Pitts, and Jerome Brown alongside total madman defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan to run roughshod all through the NFC East. In 1993, White was the first Grand Prize of the newfangled &#8220;free agent sweepstakes&#8221; era, when he took his talents to Green Bay and the Frozen Tundra.</p>
<p>As a Packer, he continued to dominate ­­with 68.5 sacks and one Lombardi Trophy over the course of six seasons. In 2008, White was to hang up his cleats <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WhitRe00.htm" target="_blank">after having compiled</a> 15 years of service, 1,048 tackles, 198 sacks, 13 consecutive trips to the Pro Bowl, and two NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards for his mantle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_820559" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pro-Football-Hall-of-Fame_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-820559 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Pro-Football-Hall-of-Fame_Jason-Miller_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Jason Miller/Getty Images" width="757" height="504" /></a> Jason Miller/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<p>Pro Bowls and All-Pro teams are nice, and winning an MVP or Player of the Year award can lead to a big payday, but being elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame is the highest individual honor an NFL player can receive. Each of the players who are fortunate enough to have earned a bronze bust in Canton, Ohio can all lay their heads down at night knowing that they have achieved football immortality.</p>
<p>To be eligible for selection to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a player must be retired for at least five years. With that being said, there are several active players who have already done enough that they should be considered locks for the Hall of Fame once they become eligible. This article will focus on those players. Before we continue any further, we wanted to point out that this list will not be featuring Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, or Aaron Rodgers. We opted to not include the quarterback position for the simple reason that the aforementioned four players are all beyond-obvious picks &#8212; in fact, we would be surprised if all four of them don’t go on to be unanimous selections.</p>
<p>As you read through this list, you will find that each of the following 10 players already have Hall of Fame-caliber resumes. With that, here is a look at 10 current NFL player who are locks to be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_820462" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Larry-Fitzgerald_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-820462 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Larry-Fitzgerald_Christian-Petersen_Getty-Images.jpg" alt="Christian Petersen/Getty Images" width="757" height="530" /></a> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>1.  Larry Fitzgerald, wide receiver, Arizona Cardinals</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>909 receptions</li>
<li>12,151 receiving yards</li>
<li>89 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fitzgerald may be a little past his prime, but the eight-time Pro Bowler can still play at a high level. Over the course of his 11 NFL seasons, he has compiled a strong enough statistical resume to be considered a likely first ballot Hall of Famer. Given that he is only 31-years-old, Fitzgerald could conceivably play for at least four or five more seasons. If he does, he could very easily become the sixth player in NFL history with 15,000 or more receiving yards.</p>
<h2>2.  Antonio Gates, tight end, San Diego Chargers</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>788 receptions</li>
<li>10,014 receiving yards</li>
<li>99 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gates helped revolutionize the tight end position at the NFL level. He has been so dominant throughout his 12-year professional career that if he retired today, he would almost surely be a first ballot Hall of Famer.</p>
<p><!--nextpage--></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_808292" align="aligncenter" width="757"]<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adrian-Peterson.jpg"><img class="wp-image-808292 size-full" src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adrian-Peterson.jpg" alt="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images" width="757" height="587" /></a> Gregory Shamus/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h2>3.  Adrian Peterson, running back, Minnesota Vikings</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>10,190 rushing yards</li>
<li>5.0 yards per carry</li>
<li>86 rushing touchdowns</li>
<li>208 receptions</li>
<li>1,715 receiving yards</li>
<li>5 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of whether or not Peterson ever regains his MVP-caliber form, the 30-year-old is bound for Canton. He will likely go on to join the exclusive club of running backs with 100 career rushing touchdowns, and there is a legitimate chance that he could become only the fourth back in league history to rush for 15,000 or more yards.</p>
<h2>4.  Jared Allen, defensive end, Chicago Bears</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>610 total tackles</li>
<li>134.0 sacks</li>
<li>32 forced fumbles</li>
<li>19 fumble recoveries</li>
<li>5 interceptions</li>
<li>55 pass deflections</li>
<li>2 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re asking us, Allen has already earned a bronze bust in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The 33-year-old defensive end is a four-time first-team All-Pro and a near lock to finish his career in the top five of the NFL’s all-time career sacks list.</p>

<h2>5.  DeMarcus Ware, outside linebacker, Denver Broncos</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>619 total tackles</li>
<li>127.0 sacks</li>
<li>34 forced fumbles</li>
<li>7 fumble recoveries</li>
<li>3 interceptions</li>
<li>25 pass deflections</li>
<li>3 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ware is in a very similar situation to that of Jared Allen. The 32-year-old outside linebacker already has a Hall of Fame-caliber resume to his name and will likely play long enough to finish in the top five of the NFL’s all-time career sacks list.</p>
<h2>6.  Darrelle Revis, cornerback, New York Jets</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>394 total tackles</li>
<li>2.0 sacks</li>
<li>23 interceptions</li>
<li>4 forced fumbles</li>
<li>8 fumble recoveries</li>
<li>124 pass deflections</li>
<li>3 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Revis may not have a gaudy interception total, but there is no denying that the four-time first-team All-Pro cornerback is one of the best defensive backs to ever play in the NFL. Opposing offenses rarely test the 29-year-old, who was the best defensive player on the New England Patriots Super Bowl XLIX winning team.</p>

<h2>7.  Charles Woodson, safety, Oakland Raiders</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>1,131 total tackles</li>
<li>20.0 sacks</li>
<li>60 interceptions</li>
<li>32 forced fumbles</li>
<li>14 fumble recoveries</li>
<li>146 pass deflections</li>
<li>13 defensive touchdowns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Very few NFL players are capable of playing at a high level into their late-30’s. Woodson (pictured above) is one of them. The first ballot Hall of Famer has been stellar throughout his 17-year career, earning first-team All-Pro honors seven times as well as winning the 2009 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. The 1998 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year is the only player in league history with 60 career interceptions and 20 career sacks. His place as one of the best defensive players in league history has already been sewn up.</p>
<h2>8.  Steve Smith Sr., wide receiver, Baltimore Ravens</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>915 receptions</li>
<li>13,262 receiving yards</li>
<li>73 touchdown receptions</li>
<li>387 rushing yards</li>
<li>2 rushing touchdowns</li>
<li>9.3 yards per punt return</li>
<li>4 punt return touchdowns</li>
<li>24.2 yards per kickoff return</li>
<li>2 kickoff return touchdowns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Smith is a classic underdog: at 5-foot-9, many scouts felt he was too small to be a No. 1 wide receiver at the NFL, and Smith subsequently fell all the way to the third round of the 2001 NFL Draft. Smith would go on to prove his naysayers wrong by developing into one of the most explosive wideouts the league has ever seen. The former Utah Ute has a bronze bust waiting for him regardless of whether or not he plays another down in the NFL.</p>

<h2>9.  Jason Witten, tight end, Dallas Cowboys</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>943 receptions</li>
<li>10,502 receiving yards</li>
<li>57 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Witten’s Hall of Fame-caliber receiving stats only tell half of the story as to how great the six-time All-Pro has been throughout his career. On top of being one of the best pass-catchers of all-time, the 33-year-old also happens to be one of the best blocking tight ends to ever play in the NFL. It wouldn’t surprise us one bit to see Witten land a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.</p>
<h2>10.  Andre Johnson, wide receiver, Indianapolis Colts</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Career Stats:</span>
<ul>
<li>1,012 receptions</li>
<li>13,597 receiving yards</li>
<li>64 touchdown receptions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Johnson is yet another example of a player who could retire today and with a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame already locked up. After spending the first 12 years of his career with the Houston Texans, the 33-year-old wide receiver signed with the Indianapolis Colts this offseason. The 2015 season will mark the first time in Johnson’s career that he will be playing with an elite quarterback in Andrew Luck, and we’re guessing that the 6-foot-3 wide receiver will thrive in the Colts’ high-flying offense.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_474805" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/view-image?src=2014/08/NFL-logo-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg"><img class="wp-image-474805 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NFL-logo-Nick-Laham-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" /></a> Nick Laham/Getty Images[/caption]

Did you know that the NFL is, for all intents and purposes, a money printing factory? It’s true. When your commissioner <a href="http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2010/04/20100405/This-Weeks-News/Goodell-Sets-Revenue-Goal-Of-$25B-By-2027-For-NFL.aspx" target="_blank">can set a $25 billion goal for revenue</a> roughly ten years in the future and not be laughed out of the room, you’re probably making enough money that it’s going over every hand and every fist that you can muster. With an average team worth of $1.17 billion dollars – <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/08/14/the-most-valuable-nfl-teams/" target="_blank">courtesy of </a><em><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2013/08/14/the-most-valuable-nfl-teams/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> –</em> it’s no secret that the average NFL team has a ton of money to throw around.

This is especially because it’s players have so little say in their contract bargaining. With tightly tethered rules around how much money each player can make, each team can hurl massive contracts and their stars and leave their role players to fend for scraps of the heavily-capped salary limits. No such limit exists for the coaches, though.

A good NFL coach is almost a lock to be handsomely rewarded for his efforts. Heck, even a bad coach is going to be paid pretty well — the average salary for a head coach was $4.6 million last season, according to <a href="http://coacheshotseat.com/">CoachesHotSeat</a>. But who’s making the most? Here are the eight most well-compensated head coaches in the NFL right now.

<h3><strong>8. Chip Kelly, Philadelphia Eagles — $6.5 Million
</strong></h3>
Chip Kelly, the head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, just wrapped up his rookie season in the NFL with a 10-6 record and a first round exit in the Wild Card at the hands of the New Orleans Saints. Kelly, who was brought to Philly after setting the NCAA on fire with his high speed offense at Oregon, was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chip-kelly-offense-could-change-nfl-forever-2013-9" target="_blank">hailed as a revolutionary at the pro level</a>, the coach who was bringing the up tempo offense to such an extreme end that <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9521983/refs-force-chip-kelly-philadelphia-eagles-slow-down" target="_blank">the normal pace of an NFL game might be responsible for slowing it down</a>. For anyone that watched the first half of the Eagles opening game against the Redskins — which was about as <em>Madden</em>-esque as any football game anyone’s ever seen in real life — it sure looked like something different was going to happen.

It didn’t, of course. Not really. Players got hurt, players ran out of breath, and defenses adapted. So it goes. But the Eagles got what they paid for when they pried Kelly out of Oregon, where he had led the Ducks to a 46-7 record over four seasons with an offer of 5 years and $32 million dollars. Is that too much for a possible gimmick offense? Dunno. It was worth every penny for that opening half, though.

<h3><strong>7. Tom Coughlin, New York Giants — $6.8 Million
</strong></h3>
From one of the youngest coaches in the NFL to the oldest, Tom Coughlin made $425,000 for every Giants game he coached in 2013, the last year of his three-year deal with the club he signed in 2011. The coach will be moving up this list a little bit when he moves into the reported $7 million one-year deal he signed in February 2014. The Giants, who have won a pair of Super Bowls under TC, have not made the playoffs since that 2011 deal.

Coughlin has been an NFL head coach for 18 years, starting off with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995 and signing with the Giants in 2004. He has a reputation for being a strict, “<a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-25/sports/43364820_1_chip-kelly-eli-manning-nfc-east" target="_blank">oh so old school</a>” head coach. He’s also saddled with Eli Manning, who earned the unique distinction of being “the worst quarterback since Mark Sanchez” last year, <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/254185/eli-manning-is-the-worst-quarterback-since-mark-sanchez" target="_blank">according to<em> The Week</em></a>. Coughlin is also responsible for <a href="http://nypost.com/2012/01/10/coughlins-frozen-face-showed-toughness-of-giants/" target="_blank">one of the most inspired headlines eve</a><a href="http://nypost.com/2012/01/10/coughlins-frozen-face-showed-toughness-of-giants/" target="_blank">r</a><a href="http://nypost.com/2012/01/10/coughlins-frozen-face-showed-toughness-of-giants/" target="_blank"> from </a><a href="http://nypost.com/2012/01/10/coughlins-frozen-face-showed-toughness-of-giants/" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>New York Post</em></a>, if only as the muse. The Giants go in to 2014 ready to improve upon a 7-9 record, their first losing season in ten years.

<h3><strong>6. John Harbaugh, Baltimore Ravens — $7 Million
</strong></h3>
Not only does John Harbaugh have a Super Bowl ring to lord over his brother Jim (who, as the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, makes a paltry $5 million a season), but he’s also got the bigger paycheck. Harbaugh — that is, John Harbaugh — has lead the Baltimore Ravens since 2008, and amassed a lifetime coaching record of 62-34, an almost 65 percent winning percentage that surely helped him sign a four-year contract extension after the Ravens snagged a Super Bowl victory over his brother and the 49ers in February of 2013. Harbaugh recently signed a one-year extension with the Baltimore team, so he is now covered until 2017.

The Ravens have not been shy about doling out money to members of their crew who preform above and beyond. Last year, after that Super Bowl win, the front office also handed quarterback Joe Flacco a six-year, $120 million dollar contract, with $52 million of it guaranteed. It was like watching Scrooge McDuck willingly dole out money to a charity. Of course, it was essentially a three-year deal, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000146725/article/joe-flaccos-ravens-contract-includes-52m-guaranteed" target="_blank">according to ProFootballTalk</a>, since the fourth year will probably not be possible under the expected salary cap. Something we’re sure John Harbaugh is stoked about.

<h3><strong>5. Jeff Fisher, St. Louis Rams — $7 Million
</strong></h3>
So. Coughlin and Harbaugh both earned their money on the back of being perpetually successful. Kelly earned his money on the promise of bringing a fast and furious football future. Jeff Fisher, who signed a 5-year deal with the St. Louis Rams worth $35 million, seemed to have grabbed his because he was moderately successful at losing. After accumulating a 142-120 record and five playoff berths that ended in failure, Fisher hit the open market in 2012 after spending ’94-2010 with the Tennessee Titans (staying with the team as they went from the Houston Oilers to the Tennessee Oilers to the Tennessee Titans, actually.)

Signing with the Rams brought Fisher into the vaunted $7 million a year coaching club, but it has done little to improve St. Louis’s outlook — the team has gone 14-17-1 since bringing in the head coach. Some of that can be attributed to Sam Bradford and his contract, signed back when rookie-scale contracts were massive and, if the pick didn’t live up to his potential, likely crippling to a team trying to contend. As a member of the Competition Committee, Fisher made “sportsmanship” an emphasis during the offseason, possibly in a response to the Richie Incognito scandal and the impending entry of at least one openly gay player into the National Football League.
<strong>Update: The Rams would eventually draft Michael Sam.</strong>

<h3><strong>4. Pete Carroll, Seattle Seahawks — $7 Million
</strong></h3>
Pete Carroll, on the other hand, might be underpaid after leading a team of castoffs all the way to the Super Bowl. Carroll, who’s Twitter profile bears the heading “Always Compete. Win Forever” is the second oldest coach in the NFL at 62, but since returning to the league in 2010 (he had previously coached the Patriots and the Jets before heading to the college level in 2000), he’s been one of the highest paid. After turning his USC team into a powerhouse, Carroll signed a contract worth five years and $35 million with the Seahawks in 2010. After a pair of 7-9 seasons, the gum chewing coach was able to turn the island of pacific-northwest misfit toys into Super Bowl champions by the fourth year of his contract.

There’s also the fact that he’s amicable. In a visit back to USC, he had a Q&amp;A ‘interrupted’ by comedian Will Ferrell, a USC alumni who has a great rapport with the coach. Seriously, that’s a thing. Check it out below.

<h3><strong>3. Mike Shanahan, Washington Redskins — $7 Million
</strong></h3>
Shanahanigans! Not only was Mike Shanahan one of the highest paid coaches in the NFL, he was also the Redskins VP of Football Operations. That means that he was totally in charge of personnel decisions regarding the Washington Franchise. It could only end well. After signing one of those five-year, $35 million contracts in 2010, Shanahan lead the Washington Redskins to exactly one winning season — the 10-6 2012 season that is best known for creating, then destroying the legend of RGIII.

Other than that, Shanahan has lead the Redskins to a 6-10 record in 2010, a 5-11 record in 2011, and a 3-13 in 2013. Not the most encouraging numbers to be entering into the final year of a million dollar deal. The Redskins thought so, too; Shanahan was fired on Black Monday, but since Jay Gruden hasn’t actually coached a game or made a draft pick for the team yet, we’re going to leave this shrine to Shanahan up for now as a testament to the futility of Dan Snyder. Here’s Shanahan’s statement after his firing.

<h3><strong>2. Bill Belichick, New England Patriots — $7.5 Million
</strong></h3>
Of course Bill Belichick was going to be on this list. He’s <a href="http://grantland.com/features/charles-p-pierce-new-england-patriots-denver-broncos-divisional-playoff-game/" target="_blank">the bomb throwing anarchist of the NFL</a>, the creative thinker who somehow managed to take the Patriots from cellar dwellers, to deep threat masters, to twin tight-end tactics, to run heavy, hard, and often in the course of ten years. After a forgettable stint with the Cleveland Browns, Belichick signed on with the Pats in 2000 and hasn’t had a losing season since.

While the details are murky regarding Belichick’s contract history — no surprise, given the man’s notoriously tight-lipped nature — we do know that after 2010, the Pats extended Belichick’s contract into the future for an annual payout of $7.5 million a year. Belichick <a href="http://www.patspulpit.com/2013/9/12/4724934/bill-belichicks-contract-extended" target="_blank">was extended again in 2013</a>, but information regarding the extension was not released publicly, to the surprise of exactly no one. He is the only head coach that has a signature peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Seriously. Check it.

<h3><strong>1. Sean Payton, New Orleans Saints — $8 million
</strong></h3>
Sean Payton, coming back from a yearlong suspension for his involvement in ‘BountyGate’ — a payout for a knockout program that the New Orleans Saints were investigated for — signed a deal that moved him to the top of the list when it came to getting paid; a five-year deal for $40 million dollars. Consider that both middle fingers up high from New Orleans to the front office. Payton, who’s absence coincided with the Saints first losing season since 2009, helped the club turn around for 2013. He also brought on Rex Ryan as the defensive coordinator, a move that helped the Saints go from sieve-like to respectable.

While the Saints were run ragged by the Seahawks, losing the divisional playoff game 15-23, the return of Payton and the inclusion of Rex Ryan seem to point to a bright future for Drew Brees and company. Even if they don’t win, at least Sean Payton knows he’s making more money than the rest of his contemporaries. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbU4VRs2rro" target="_blank">Per Worthington’s law</a>, that means he’s unassailable.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_733418" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-733418 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Bortles.-Rob-Foldy-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="512" /> Rob Foldy/Getty Images[/caption]

The sack may be the most depressing end to a down in the game of football — at least for the offensive line, quarterback, and the rest of that team’s fans and supporters — save perhaps death, grievous injury, or the appearance of Bob Costas. In the clinical sense, it’s a loss of yardage, putting a team farther away from the end zone than it was at the start.

In the emotional sense, it means that the defense has successfully rattled the quarterback, as well as the offensive coordinator and the O-line. Protecting the ball — and by extension, the guy who throws the ball — is of paramount importance toward winning football games. The sack is the utter antithesis of that.

It’s hard to see how a team that lets its quarterback get sacked with any kind of frequency can mount a serious attempt at making it all the way to the Super Bowl — it’s part of the reason Denver was willing to entertain <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26914465/richie-incognito-working-out-broncos" target="_blank">signing Richie Incognito</a> — and that makes perfect sense. If you can’t keep your signal caller upright, how can you put points on the board?

And so, here we are, examining the most-sacked quarterbacks through Week 14. All data are courtesy of <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/" target="_blank">Pro-Football-Reference.</a><!--nextpage-->

<strong>7. Russell Wilson, sacked 33 times
</strong>

The Seahawks are 9-4 and are hanging out on the outskirts of the playoffs, looking in. You could say that part of the reason for their relative failure — at least, compared to their Super Bowl-winning year a season ago — has been that Russell Wilson is getting knocked down more than usual. His 2014 numbers are <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WilsRu00.htm" target="_blank">already matching his total from 2012</a>, but he’s still sitting at 11 sacks below his total from last season. The jury, as it were, is out.

<strong>6. Ryan Tannehill, sacked 34 times
</strong>

The Miami Dolphins, by contrast, are not a particularly excellent NFL team, even if they have been a pleasant surprise up to this point in the season, with a shot at finishing out the year above .500 for <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/" target="_blank">the first time since 2008</a>. While the Dolphins haven’t indicated whether they have faith in Ryan Tannehill as their long-term starter, they’re not doing a particularly good job of keeping him out of harm’s way.

<strong>5. Cam Newton, sacked 36 times
</strong>

Before the season started, we found ourselves in a conversation with some friends about whom Cam Newton was going to throw to, now that he’d lost Steve Smith to Baltimore and Brandon LaFell to New England. Could he, we wondered, be allowed to throw the ball down the field and then run out and try to catch it? (Note: this is against the rules in professional football.) Either way, Newton hasn’t had much time to think about the fact that no one has ever heard of his receiving corps, because he’s spent much of the last season in poses like the one you see above.

<h4>4. Alex Smith and Blake Bortles [tie], each sacked 38 times</h4>
This is a tie neither player is in much of a rush to break. Bortles, the rookie quarterback in Jacksonville, technically has the edge (which is bad) in this matchup, since he’s only started 10 games to Smith’s 13. This makes sense, because the Jaguars are still struggling to reach the competency of Kansas City. Neither team is slated to make much, if any, noise in the playoffs. Stop snickering, please.

<h4>2. Matthew Stafford, sacked 39 times</h4>
In some ways, this has not been an awesome year for Matt Stafford, and a lot of that has to be laid at the feet of the laid-up Calvin Johnson, although he’s not to blame for Stafford’s penchant for getting laid out this season. Second only to another wunderkind quarterback (although Matty S. definitely has more of a “rocket arm"), in fact. Despite that, the Lions have posted a <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/" target="_blank">9-4 record</a> as of this writing and are quietly putting together one of their best seasons in years.

<h4>1. Colin Kaepernick, sacked 43 times</h4>
Poor Colin Kaepernick. Not only did he suffer the indignity of losing to the Oakland Raiders and the indignity of (probably) losing video games to Russell Wilson, as well as the looming indignity of losing the only good head coach he’s ever known, but he’s also getting tossed around like a rag doll out there. Now he’s getting called a chump by <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11997418/sio-moore-oakland-raiders-targets-chump-colin-kaepernick-field" target="_blank">relatively unknown linemen</a> and watching his playoff dreams get dragged through the mud. Which is appropriate, because he’s also being dragged through that very same mud. Sometimes it’s grass, too.

		<description><![CDATA[Where does Scooby Wright's name rank among the greatest football player nicknames? From Booger to Cadillac, we revisit our favorite nicknames of all time.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_706889" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-706889 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/456467640.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="449" /> Christian Petersen/Getty Images[/caption]

What's in a nickname, Mr. Lebowski? Is it the alliteration? Is it the imagery it conjures up, or is it the knowledge that a player is good enough at their given sport to be bestowed When Arizona linebacker Scooby Wright helped ensure the Wildcats’ upset victory over No. 2 Oregon late Thursday night by ripping the ball away from Ducks quarterback Marcus Mariota, it got us thinking. Not just about who would replace Oregon in the latest College Football Playoff projection, if Michigan is regretting firing Rich Rodriguez, or any of those pesky football-related questions. No, Scooby Wright got us thinking about something a little more fun: Where does “Scooby” rank among the greatest football player nicknames of all time?

We decided to try and compile 25 of our favorite nicknames for your perusal and debate. With apologies to Big Ben, Broadway Joe, Iron Mike, Johnny Football, Mean Joe, etc., we restricted ourselves to actual “replacement” nicknames, as opposed to just a single adjective added on to the person’s first name. Nicknames are listed in alphabetical order. Enjoy.

<h4>1. All Day</h4>
Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has gone by “All Day,” or A.D. for short, since <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/adrian-peterson-suffered-severe-abuse-father-article-1.1942400" target="_blank">his father gave him</a> the nickname as a young boy because Peterson would never stop running.
<h4>2. Beast Mode</h4>
Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch has made <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2013/story/_/id/10308914/marshawn-lynch-seattle-seahawks-profits-beast-mode" target="_blank">quite a bit of money</a> off this moniker, a term that speaks to his powerful running approach.
<h4>3. Booger</h4>
Former Buccaneers defensive lineman, ex-LSU standout, and current <a href="http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2014/04/mcfarland_spears/" target="_blank">SEC Network</a> analyst Anthony McFarland will always be known as “Booger” to us. Booger’s mom gave him the infamous nickname <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/4000/where-are-they-now-anthony-mcfarland" target="_blank">when he was just 2 years old</a>.
<h4>4. Bus</h4>
Notre Dame’s student newspaper <a href="http://www.sikids.com/photos/7814/nfl-nicknames/24" target="_blank">gave star back</a> and future Steelers great Jerome Bettis (pictured) the well-known “Bus” nickname. Needless to say, it stuck.
<h4>5. Cadillac</h4>
A Birmingham-area sportscaster first dubbed Auburn tailback Carnell Williams “Cadillac” <a href="http://www.thehuddle.com/nfl_players/2006/rb-williams.php" target="_blank">because of his smooth running style</a>, and the nickname followed him <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WillCa02.htm" target="_blank">to the NFL</a>, first with the Buccaneers and later the Rams.

<h4>6. Deacon</h4>
Pro Football Hall of Famer David “Deacon” Jones was obviously creative: He gave himself the legendary nickname — “No one would remember a player named David Jones,” <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/2013/6/4/NFL-Football-Legend-Deacon-Jones-dies/" target="_blank">he said</a> — and is also credited with creating the term “sack” to describe tackling the quarterback behind the line of scrimmage.
<h4>7. Freak</h4>
While “Freak” has become a popular descriptive term for athletes in recent years (in fact, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/22278381/freaks-list-the-20-craziest-athletes-in-college-football" target="_blank">one writer</a> puts together an annual “Freak List” each offseason), the nickname is still most recognizably associated with former Florida Gator, Tennessee Titan, and Philadelphia Eagle <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KearJe00.htm" target="_blank">Jevon Kearse</a> (pictured).
<h4>8. Galloping Ghost</h4>
One of the best football players of all time, Red Grange, received the nickname “Galloping Ghost” from <a href="http://baseballhall.org/discover/awards/j-g-taylor-spink/warren-brown" target="_blank">sportswriter Warren Brown</a> after one particularly ridiculous collection of touchdowns for the Illini.
<h4>9. Honey Badger</h4>
Cardinals defensive back Tyrann Mathieu was known as “Honey Badger” at LSU before off-field problems got him kicked off the team. Mathieu has said that he’d be fine leaving that particular nickname <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/shutdown-corner/tyrann-mathieu-discusses-reviving-honey-badger-nickname-whatever-145907461.html" target="_blank">in the past</a>.
<h4>10. Ickey</h4>
Former Bengal Elbert Woods, better known as “Ickey,” received that particular nickname <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19890122&amp;id=Em4fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zSsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4365,4032778" target="_blank">because his younger brother</a> couldn’t say Elbert properly. The resulting “e-e” sound somehow morphed into Ickey. And, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFrsR9NByc4" target="_blank">let’s face it</a>: We can all agree that the “Elbert Shuffle” isn’t nearly as cool-sounding a name.

<h4>11. Ironhead</h4>
Former NFL fullback and 1988 first-round pick Craig “Ironhead” Heyward received his nickname from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/sports/football/29heyward.html?fta=y&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">lowering his head</a> into would-be tacklers during street football games as a boy, according to The New York Times.
<h4>12. Juice</h4>
Orenthal James Simpson will forever be known as O.J., but during the football chapter of his life, that predictably translated to the <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/oj-simpson-1.html" target="_blank">USC Trojans and Buffalo Bills</a> standout being referred to as just “Juice.”
<h4>13. Megatron</h4>
Lions superstar wide receiver Calvin Johnson was called “Megatron” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/sports/football/lions-calvin-johnson-defies-description.html" target="_blank">by teammate</a> Roy Williams during Johnson’s rookie year in Detroit. Seven years later, it seems like Johnson (pictured) has always been Megatron.
<h4>14. Minister of Defense</h4>
Hall of Famer Reggie White <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=257" target="_blank">became an ordained Baptist minister</a> at age 17, and White was known as “The Minister of Defense” from his time at the University of Tennessee through his NFL stops at Philadelphia, Green Bay, and Carolina.
<h4>15. Moose</h4>
Fox analyst and former Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston first received his “Moose” nickname <a href="http://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2010/10/15/1752657/btb-interview-former-cowboys-fullback-daryl-moose-johnston" target="_blank">from Cowboys teammate</a> Babe Laufenberg because of his size <a href="http://www.sikids.com/photos/7814/nfl-nicknames/18" target="_blank">compared to the rest</a> of the team’s backs.

<h4>16. Muscle Hamster</h4>
Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back (and Boise State product) Doug Martin has been known as the “Muscle Hamster” since his college days because of his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/11/06/doug-martin-doesnt-like-muscle-hamster/1685841/" target="_blank">weightlifting prowess</a> — or was it <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/11/09/muscle-hamster-nickname-came-from-act-of-chivalry/" target="_blank">his girlfriend</a> who had the name first? Martin’s not a big fan, and even held a <a href="http://tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-doug-martin-asks-fans-for-nickname-ideas-559910" target="_blank">contest</a> for fans to try and select a replacement nickname.
<h4>17. Nigerian Nightmare</h4>
Christian Okoye, who played fullback for the Chiefs from 1987-1992 — why does it seem like running backs and fullbacks get all the nicknames, anyway? — was known as the “Nigerian Nightmare” in tribute to his homeland. The Enugu, Nigeria, native scored <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/O/OkoyCh00.htm" target="_blank">40 touchdowns</a> during his time in Kansas City and later <a href="http://www.christianokoye.com/okoye/guest-appearances" target="_blank">published a book</a> called <em>The Nigerian Nightmare</em>.
<h4>18. Pacman</h4>
Bengals defensive back Adam Jones has been known as Pacman for most of his life. Jones’s mother gave him the nickname as an baby because of the sound he made <a href="http://www.fox19.com/story/23929004/another-side-of-pacman-jones" target="_blank">eating from a bottle</a>. As Jones tries to distance himself from a string of off-field incidents in his early NFL career, he has <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/bengals/2010-08-02-adam-jones-first-practice_N.htm" target="_blank">attempted to ditch</a> the Pacman name.
<h4>19. Prime Time</h4>
Deion Sanders, one of the flashiest players to ever compete in professional football — well, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sandede02.shtml" target="_blank">professional baseball</a>, too– was a big enough star to command multiple nicknames. Prime Time is the one that usually comes to mind first, but Sanders also answered to “Neon Deion.”
<h4>20. Refrigerator</h4>
We don’t want to insult your intelligence by explaining exactly how <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PerrWi20.htm" target="_blank">former Chicago Bear</a> William Perry got his “Refrigerator” nickname. Just check out the picture at the top of this page for a moment. Let’s move on, shall we?

<h4>21. Revis Island</h4>
Star cornerback Darrelle Revis has earned the “Revis Island” title because no opposing quarterback ever wants to throw at whichever receiver he’s covering. Revis <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/10/darrelle-revis-is-now-the-official-proud-owner-of-revis-island" target="_blank">now owns</a> the trademark, as well, even if Revis Island isn’t actually a real place (<a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/revis-island-now-on-the-map-in-new-england-literally-031414" target="_blank">to this fan’s disappointment</a>).
<h4>22. Rocket</h4>
Raghib Ismail, best known for his return prowess <a href="http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/raghib-ismail-1.html" target="_blank">at Notre Dame</a> (where he won a national title and was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy), was first called “Rocket” <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/blog/dr_saturday/post/catching-up-with-raghib-ismail-notre-dames-rocket-hopes-to-score-with-latest-football-investment?urn=ncaaf,wp4289" target="_blank">by a high school track coach</a>. Ismail’s blazing speed would pay dividends on the football field for years to come.
<h4>23. Shady</h4>
Sixth-year Eagles running back LeSean McCoy is often referred to as “Shady.” <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2014/08/19/lesean-mccoy-chip-kelly-philadelphia-barry-sanders/14310805/" target="_blank">His mother</a> gave him the nickname when McCoy was just a boy, referring to his typical quick change <a href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/sports/eagles/shady-s-life-changing-moment/article_30c8ff32-dcb9-5010-bea3-e82255206274.html" target="_blank">in moods.</a>
<h4>24. Shoelace</h4>
Ex-Michigan quarterback and current Jaguars jack-of-all-trades Denard Robinson is better known by the moniker of “Shoelace,” because the speedster is known for <a href="http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2013/04/espn_explains_the_science_behi.html" target="_blank">never tying his shoes</a>.
<h4>25. Sweetness</h4>
Chicago Bears great and eventual Hall of Famer Walter Payton was known as “Sweetness” ever since college, when he set a national record <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/bears-in-the-hall/walter-payton.html" target="_blank">with 363 points scored</a> at Jackson State. Payton <a href="http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.aspx?PLAYER_ID=174" target="_blank">led the NFL</a> in rushing for five seasons in a row, from 1976-1980.

		<description><![CDATA[Running backs are a competitive bunch, and they're all keenly aware of how much each other are making. This can cause problems in the locker room and at camp.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_676389" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img class="wp-image-676389 size-full" src="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jamaal-Charles-Jamie-Squire-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="432" /> Jamie Squire/Getty Images[/caption]

That’s Jamaal Charles, the excellent running back for the Kansas City Chiefs. Charles, who was scheduled to make at least $2.5 million at the start of this season in salary from the Chiefs (he could have made up to $3.6 million, but the $2.5 million was guaranteed), is not even close to making this list, and that made him sad. Or angry. Either way, Indian Jesus took a stand about his pay, sat out from training camp, and <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000367741/article/jamaal-charles-strikes-new-contract-with-chiefs" target="_blank">promptly struck a new deal with the franchise</a>, one that will give him a pay bump to put him in the same pay grade as his peers.

Did he actually stay back from training camp in order to force the franchise’s hand on a better deal? If you take <a href="https://twitter.com/jcharles25/statuses/492061462827778048" target="_blank">Charles’s word for it</a>, the answer’s no. “I had no intention on holding out. … I just ran out of gas on the way to camp and my cell phone battery died. It was a long walk I tell ya.”

Charles’s new deal, a two-year extension, will pay him $18.1 million more than his previous contract, according to NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport, who broke the story.

<h4>5. Ray Rice, Baltimore Ravens, $35 million</h4>
In addition to his offseason domestic violence incident (which was, frankly, given <a href="https://twitter.com/RavensInsider/status/492311874202251265" target="_blank">a disgustingly lax punishment from the NFL</a>), Ray Rice, the fifth highest-paid running back in the NFL, looked for all the world like he’d lost “it” last season. Suffering a significant drop in yards per carry — from 4.4 to 3.1 — as well as failing to record a single passing touchdown for the first time since 2008, Rice, now 27, may have gone over the very real precipice when running backs go from amazing to retirement seemingly overnight.

Or it could’ve been an aberration. The Ravens, overall, played their 2013 season like they were suffering from a hangover after the Super Bowl, and quarterback Joe Flacco reverted back from his video game-esque God Mode from that year’s playoffs. They eventually finished eight-and-eight, which felt about right if you caught any of their games last season.
<h4>4. Jonathan Stewart, Carolina Panthers, $36.5 million</h4>
This seems like a lot of money, considering that Cam Newton is Carolina’s best running back (for those of you unfamiliar with Cam Newton, he’s the team’s quarterback, and arguably the best running QB since prime Michael Vick). Stewart, who only managed to play in six games last season after battling through knee and back injuries, most notably a torn MCL, is having his massive contract work as job security, since the Panthers would have nearly $20 million in dead space on their cap if they let him go.

<h4>3. Arian Foster, Houston Texans, $43 million</h4>
Still shortlisted as one of the best running backs in the game, Arian Foster signed his contract — a five-year deal — in 2012, when the Texans were on the upswing and looked to become a dark horse in the AFC South. The team took a serious step back last season finishing 2-14, and Foster’s injury woes were one of the contributing factors to their sharp decline as he notched just two touchdowns (including rushing and passing). That said, it’s hard to say whether or not Foster’s cooked yet, since he’s healthy so far, and the Texans are planning on giving him an increased role in the passing game under new head coach Bill O’Brien.

<h4>2. LeSean McCoy, Philadelphia Eagles, $45 million</h4>
The biggest beneficiary of Chip Kelly’s manic offense, LeSean McCoy played like he deserved even more than his massive contract, signed in 2012 when Andy Reid, and his mustache, were still calling the plays for Philly. That’s not the best part about LeSean “Shady” McCoy though — the best part is that while he jukes his teammates in practice, he apparently says (or said) his last name, McCoy, as he does it. Don’t just take our word from it, you <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_Tags/statuses/252578078960779264" target="_blank">can go straight to the source</a>. Now watch that highlight video above and you’ll realize it is impossible to watch an Eagles game without saying “McCoy” to yourself, quietly, every time he does something awesome. You’re welcome.

<h4>1. Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings, $96 million</h4>
All Day is getting paid. After signing what was originally reported to be a $100 million deal back in 2011, the contract turned out to be ‘only’ $96 million. Which doesn’t seem like an unreasonable price for the best thing about the Minnesota Vikings. Peterson, who became the unattainable standard after coming back from an exploded knee to challenge for the NFL’s single season rushing record in 2012, is consistently one of the most exciting running backs in the league — especially in his tendency to run straight over players, rather than juke them like McCoy.

Unfortunately, the Vikings have been unable to field anything like a competitive team since they drafted Peterson back in 2007, making the playoffs only three times. Hopefully they’re able to bring AP further into the postseason before he hangs up his cleats.

<p>Wide receivers and quarterbacks are two of the most symbiotic positions in the entire game of football. The best wideouts make signal calling look downright easy, while a competent quarterback can deliver the pigskin exactly where it needs to go. The forgotten histories of the NFL are littered with the receivers who spent their primes without anyone half decent at signal caller, and even the most skilled quarterbacks are at a loss when they don&#8217;t have competent receivers. You can ask Tom Brady circa 2013 about that.</p>
<p>That said, different receiver-quarterback combinations result in different things, and while some receivers are best used as all purpose targets, and some of them checkdown safety valves, what&#8217;s being ranked today are the duos that put the most points on the board &#8212; the pairs that are responsible for the most successful touchdown connections in NFL history. Some are still going, and some are hall of famers, but all of them are on the short list, if only as a pair, as some of the greatest the league has ever seen.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Philip Rivers &amp; Antonio Gates &#8212; 63 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>One of only two tandems that are still going strong in 2014, the San Diego Chargers&#8217; are going into their ninth season with Philip Rivers as their starting quarterback, and the rocket-armed quarterback hasn&#8217;t found a more reliable target than tight end Antonio Gates, who joined the NFL  a year before Rivers, in 2003, and is still making <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000060175/Antonio-Gates-one-handed-catch" target="_blank">catches like this one</a> look routine.</p>
<p>Together, Gates and Rivers have watched as the Chargers have gone from legitimate Super Bowl contenders to also rans, but as they&#8217;ve combined for 378 points over the last almost-decade, they can&#8217;t take very much of the blame for their failure to win the big one. With Gates already reeling in three Rivers touchdowns in the first two weeks of the 2014 season, this pair could be due for a very quick rise in these standings before the season is out.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry &#8212; 64 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>The oldest duo on this list, Raymond Berry and Johnny Unitas spent 1956 to 1967 pairing up for touchdown after touchdown as members of the Baltimore Colts (now based out of Indianapolis). Unitas actually lead the league in touchdown passes in four separate seasons over that time period, from &#8217;57-&#8217;60, and Berry grabbed 39 of them. They also won a pair of Super Bowls.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Joe Montana &amp; Jerry Rice &#8212; 67 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re throwing to one of the best receivers in the history of the game, you&#8217;re probably going to put a bunch of points on the board, and when you&#8217;re a quarterback like Joe Montana, you might even go down as one of the most memorable offensive tandems of all time. Rice and Montana are one of the legendary pairings in 49ers history &#8212; so good that even fans who despise San Fran have to give Montana and Rice the nod.</p>
<p>Rice entered the league in 1985, and would wind up outlasting Montana on the professional level for a decade. While Montana retired in 1994, Rice was cementing his legacy well into the 21st century.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Brett Favre &amp; Antonio Freeman &#8212; 67 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>While Brett Favre is in danger of losing his career touchdown record to Peyton Manning, his connection with Antonio Freeman cannot be denied. While Freeman was only a Green Bay starter for six seasons, he never finished with fewer than six touchdowns during his time with the Packers. For four of those years (&#8217;96-&#8217;99), Freeman was the leading receiver for Green Bay, and in 1998, he hauled in 14 touchdowns on the season.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Drew Brees &amp; Marques Colston &#8212; 67 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>The second &#8212; and most successful as of this writing &#8212; active pairing that&#8217;s on this list, Colston and Brees have been mutual beneficiaries of a high octane scoring attack that&#8217;s totaled nearly 300 touchdowns since 2006, and nearly a quarter of them have been credited to the two players listed here. While they&#8217;ve yet to connect up for a score in 2014, Colston has already pulled in 110 yards over 5 catches so far.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Jim Kelly &amp; Andre Reed &#8212; 71 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>Last seen on the same roster in 1996, as Kelly retired after that season, the two mainstays of the great Bills teams from the early &#8217;90s managed to score 426 points for the Western New York franchise during their forays into the late postseason. While Buffalo would ultimately be unsuccessful in their efforts to win a Super Bowl (they famously lost four consecutive apperances), Kelly and Reed would wind up retiring as lifelong Bills. Yes, we know that Andre Reed wound up signing with Washington for 2000, but isn&#8217;t the idea that he went out a Bill so much better?</p>

<h3><strong>4. Peyton Manning &amp; Reggie Wayne &#8212; 76 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a theory floated occasionally in the more suspicious corners of the NFL&#8217;s Internet fandom that Peyton Manning does a lot to make his receivers look good &#8212; Eric Decker&#8217;s five year deal for $36 million from the Jets was the most recent example of that since a) people like to mock the Jets and b) Peyton Manning managed to connect up with Decker for 24 touchdowns and 2,300 yards over two years. The implication, then, is that the Jets don&#8217;t have a Peyton Manning, so they don&#8217;t need an Eric Decker.</p>
<p>One of the guys who would disprove this Manning theory is Reggie Wayne, who joined forces with the elder sibling in 2001 and quickly notched all but nine of his career touchdowns with number 18 (more impressive when you consider that Wayne caught exactly zero touchdowns as a rookie). Wayne&#8217;s abilities as a receiver were able to transcend Peyton&#8217;s neck injury, and he was able to pull in four end zone receptions despite being dealt some underwhelming replacements &#8212; guys with names like Painter, Collins, and Orlovsky.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Dan Marino &amp; Mark Clayton &#8212; 82 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>From 1983 until 1992, Clayton and Marino &#8212; who were on track to have nearly identical careers in that they came into the league at the same time &#8212; retired at the same time, and both (nearly) played the entirety of their careers for the same team, the Miami Dolphins. They were a pairing that brought joy to South Florida, even if they never managed to win it all. Again, this is a situation where Clayton actually wound up playing for different teams for the last year of his career, spending 1993 in Green Bay, but he was a husk of himself.</p>

Manbanglo/AFP/Getty Images[/caption]</p>
<h3><strong>2. Steve Young &amp; Jerry Rice &#8212; 92 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>The second appearance for Jerry Rice on this list and the real foundation for his legacy &#8212; although his almost 20 year career and his legendary numbers certainly don&#8217;t hurt &#8212; the 14 years that Rice and Young were paired together (with eight featuring Young as the starting quarterback) were astonishing, as they averaged six and a half touchdown connections a season for a decade and a half.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Peyton Manning &amp; Marvin Harrison &#8212; 118 Touchdowns</strong></h3>
<p>Marvin Harrison was fortunate enough to spend his entire career with Peyton Manning, and as Peyton Manning&#8217;s favorite red zone target, notching eight consecutive seasons with at least 10 touchdowns from 1999 to 2006. For the completists, in chronological order, Harrison and Manning connected for 12, 14, 15, 11, 10, 15, 12, and 12 scores over that period of time, and still managed to pick up another 17 scores in the less successful seasons. Harrison retired in 2008, and Manning would soldier on with other targets before leaving Indianapolis on paper in 2011 and officially in 2012.</p>
